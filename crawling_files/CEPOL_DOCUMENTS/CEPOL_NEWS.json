Through the setup of a new system architecture, CEPOL has made possible the creation of autonomous learning sites and a safe space for localisation and customisation of training resources to serve users of project partners. In practical terms, the multitenancy allows law enforcement officials from CEPOL projects\u2019 partners to register on the platform. Each of CEPOL International Cooperation projects \u2013 CT INFLOW, EUROMED Police, TOPCOP and WB PaCT \u2013 has now a dedicated learning space that allows the delivery of online components to law enforcement, including online courses and webinars, to complement the traditional training and onsite activities, thus following a blended-learning approach. In the framework of EUROMED Police, the learning space will represent the Euromed Knowledge Base as an important milestone of the project. About this new development, CEPOL\u2019s Executive Director, Dr h.c. Detlef Schr\u00f6der, highlighted: \u201cOur multitenancy environment is born to become a shared pool of learning and training resources for the law enforcement community in our projects\u2019 partners. The latest development in our e-learning platform will contribute to scale up training, knowledge and best practices to a wider law enforcement audience in the EU\u2019s Neighbourhood region\u201d. In practice, each of the four new online learning spaces is entirely dedicated to the corresponding project, while its content is exclusively available and customised to CEPOL projects\u2019 partners. Each course will have a discussion forum in order to allow course participants to engage in discussions or to share knowledge about particular crime areas. Assignments and quiz activities will also be available to test the trainees' level of comprehension regarding course materials, which provides trainers with insights into every learner\u2019s progress and potential knowledge gaps. The introduction of the multitenancy component in LEEd has no impact on the experience of already registered users \u2013 one of the particularities of this type of online architecture is that users only see the learning content relevant and available to them within the training catalogue.

The main operational activities are listed in a joint report of the Justice and Home Affairs Agencies Network (JHAAN) published today on the occasion of EU Anti-Trafficking Day under the leadership of Eurojust. The report is a key building block of the EU Strategy on combatting Trafficking in Human Beings and serves as a key reference document for national authorities engaged in tackling human trafficking. The Executive Director of CEPOL, Dr. h.c. Detlef Schr\u00f6der noted: \u2018We have made significant progress together and the joint report of the JHA agencies\u2019 network marks our dedication to continue our efforts on the identification and protection of victims of human trafficking. To counter this complex phenomenon, creating a network of trust is key, and law enforcement cooperation, knowledge and skills are important elements of success for cross-border operations. CEPOL will continue to contribute to our common efforts by offering the EU law enforcement community top-notch training opportunities so that they can stay ahead of this heinous crime\u2019. During the Eurojust Presidency of the JHAAN, for the first time, a compendium was made of all different actions taken by CEPOL, EASO, EIGE, eu-LISA, Eurojust, Europol, FRA and Frontex, to reach out to victims of human trafficking at all stages of prevention, investigations, operations and legal proceedings. The initiative is a concrete result following the Joint Statement of commitment to work together against trafficking in human beings, signed in 2018. The JHAAN report of today aims to make Member States more aware of the Agencies\u2019 potential in helping the early identification and protection of victims. Furthermore, it encourages them to cooperate closely with the Agencies involved in this area and to build on their expertise. The report responds to one of the key actions of the EU Strategy on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings 2021-2025. The report is the result of a questionnaire sent to all agencies and the outcome of a meeting of JHAAN experts, hosted by Eurojust in June this year. It builds on two important strands in the process of investigating criminal networks involved in human trafficking, namely the early identification of victims and measures and actions for their protection. Training activities covering Trafficking in Human Beings are always an important part of the CEPOL training portfolio. More specifically, this month, to mark the EU Anti-Trafficking day, CEPOL organised an onsite training activity on child trafficking. The aim of the course was to enhance the capacity of law enforcement officers in identifying child victims and in tackling child trafficking. Also on the 21st of October, CEPOL is organising a webinar on Nigerian Trafficking networks. Participants will enhance their knowledge on these networks operating in the EU and engaging in the sexual exploitation of young women via the presentation of the EMPACT THB `ETUTU` project and a case study. CEPOL\u2019s online learning platform, LEEd, has a dedicated section on THB, where law enforcement officials can find a variety of learning resources on the topic, including recorded webinars addressing new and emerging trends, such as Webinar 18/2021 'Children in migration at risk of trafficking', Webinar 17/2021 Trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation and victim engagement - Case studies, Webinar 71/2020 'The protection of EU national children deprived of parental care who are victims or at risk of trafficking', Webinar COVID 11/2020 'The impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on modi operandi in THB and the consequences for law enforcement', as well as our online module, providing the knowledge and skills needed to identify and assist potential victims of trafficking. More information on this year\u2019s activities on THB are available in the CEPOL Training Catalogue 2021.

It was the first face-to-face CNU meeting to be held after the outbreak of the pandemic at the beginning of 2020. On this special occasion, CEPOL Executive Director, Dr. h.c. Detlef Schr\u00f6der commented: \u201cThe pandemic changed the way we work and made us adjust to new, unknown situations. It also allowed us to appreciate the tools offered to us by technology, as we were able to remotely continue our work. Our agency adapted to this new reality and never ceased to deliver high-quality training activities to the law enforcement community, even under such difficult circumstances. This CNU meeting, however, reminds us all of how valuable it is to be able to meet in person, to exchange views and experiences face-to-face and have fruitful discussions regarding the agency\u2019s activities and future goals.\u201d The meeting, chaired by the Head of CNU Slovenia, provided the opportunity for CEPOL to inform participants on the latest developments and accomplishments of the agency. Among the topics covered was an update on CEPOL Expert Groups, such as the Expert Group on Fundamental Rights, as well as CEPOL Knowledge Centres (CKCs) on Counter-terrorism \u2013 (CKC CT) and on Information Exchange and Interoperability (CKC INT). Additionally, CNUs were updated on the status of the EU\u2013STNA 2022-2025 exercise, launched in December 2020 to identify strategic and EU level training needs of law enforcement officials for the next policy cycle, 2022-2025, as well as the status of the OTNA exercise , whose methodology had been updated in May 2020. More specifically, OTNA is conducted by the agency to provide an understanding of the details of training in priority areas defined by the EU-STNA. CEPOL has already launched OTNAs in the thematic areas of Counterterrorism, Digital skills of law enforcement, Environmental crime, Fundamental rights and data protection, to contribute to the CEPOL 2023 training portfolio. Other topics on the agenda included updates on the topic of International cooperation, and more specifically on the progress made with the implementation of the four CEPOL Capacity-building projects (CT INFLOW, EUROMED Police, TOPCOP and WB PACT), and on CEPOL\u2019s External relations. Developments concerning LEEd, the agency\u2019s e-Learning platform, and the upcoming onsite edition of the CEPOL Research and Science Conference wound up this 2-days meeting. Back to back-meetings CEPOL also held in Budapest its National LEEd Managers meeting this week. And, following the CNU meeting, on 14-15 October, the agency is hosting the annual network meeting of the CEPOL Research and Science Correspondents.

This high-level event was co-organised by Europol and the Italian Ministry of Interior in the context of the allocation of the Recovery Fund \u2013 Next Generation Europe (NGEU), a new instrument designed by the European Commission to stimulate economic and social recovery after COVID-19. The aim of the forum was to share best practises and discuss potential threats of illegal activities affecting the recovery funds, in order to ensure that all necessary preventive measures are in place. The overall sentiment is that, for the large scale of funds provided for by the EU to successfully reach and fulfil their intended destination and objectives, EU Member States and relevant EU bodies must step up their efforts for a timely exchange of information, thus identifying common tools (indicators, patterns and early warnings) and achieving a consistent approach throughout the EU. Participating as a speaker in the discussion on the role of EU Bodies in the prevention of infiltration of criminal networks in the implementation of NGEU, Ms Pukonen stressed the importance of law enforcement training and education. \u2018CEPOL will continue to contribute to the successful implementation of the Next Generation EU, by offering law enforcement officials training opportunities in relevant topics\u2019, she noted. \u2018Additionally, through our webinars, we are creating awareness regarding the newest modus operandi and the use of new technologies by the criminal networks for money laundering of crime proceeds, e.g. crypto-currencies, virtual banking services, wire transfers\u2019. The CEPOL Head of Operations also underlined the Agency\u2019s preparedness to continuously adapt its training offer in order to respond effectively to current and future trends, as was the case last year during the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis: \u2018CEPOL adapted the training curricula and continued to deliver training activities for law enforcement all over Europe in an online format. A series of specific COVID-19-related webinars were rapidly designed and implemented, attracting great attention and bringing along high satisfaction rates among our target audiences\u201d, she highlighted.

The video message brings us back to the European Council in 1999 in Tampere (Finland), where the decision to establish the Agency was made. CEPOL Executive Director highlights how fast the Agency has developed since then, paying special attention to the solid training portfolio and qualification options the Agency has built over the past 20 years to this day. Dr. h.c. Schr\u00f6der underscores the important role CEPOL plays when it comes to connecting professionals working in the field of law enforcement across the EU and beyond: \u201cBuilding trust and confidence is at the core of what we do.

The impact the pandemic has had so far on law enforcement, and what had been done and could be done in tackling it, is also the subject of the two opening articles of this issue of the Bulletin: Focusing attention to the individual level, Frenkel, Giessing, Jaspaert & Staller consider \u201cHow to prepare police officers to cope with pandemic specific stressors\u201d in reference to survey data collected in several European countries. Taking a particular organisational perspective, Gergely Mogyor\u00f3di describes the \u201cThe Impacts of COVID-19 Epidemic on the Daily Work of SIRENE Hungary\u201d , as part of the Schengen-wide cross-border information exchange network. The Summer 2021 edition of the Bulletin carries seven more read-worthy articles, covering themes like recruitment for peace keeping missions, predictive policing, organised crime, cybercrime and domestic abuse/violence.

Active and close collaboration between both organisations has been a mutual practice, for instance, with the development this year of specific onsite and eLearning training activities on the topic of hate crime available to EU law enforcement officials. This working arrangement provides now a structured, long-term frame of cooperation in the areas of exchange of knowledge, consultations and, notably, in the development, dissemination and delivery of training activities and awareness-raising materials and publications. \u201cFundamental rights are a cross-cutting priority in CEPOL\u2019s learning portfolio and its EU-funded project activities. By signing this cooperation agreement, both agencies look to further help each other to strengthen the fundamental rights aspects of law enforcement training and learning\u201d, highlighted Dr. h.c. Detlef Schr\u00f6der. Michael O\u2019Flaherty, Director of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, added: \u201cThis Working Arrangement will further strengthen the good cooperation of FRA and CEPOL. It will help ensure that fundamental rights issues are well covered in law enforcement training activities, supporting law enforcement officials in respecting people\u2019s rights in their daily work.\u201d Invited by EU bodies and agencies to become an active cooperation partner in efforts to promote fundamental rights aspects within the Member States, CEPOL established this year an Expert Group on Fundamental Rights, where FRA participation is greatly appreciated.

The implications of AI on fundamental rights are currently an important topic of discussion at the national and international level. Developing a specific legal framework that will regulate AI in order to ensure that the use of this technology will have a human-centric approach, aiming to serve the public good, is crucial for the future of AI. For years, the European Commission has been facilitating and enhancing cooperation on AI across the EU to boost its competitiveness and ensure trust based on EU values. In April 2021, the European Commission presented its proposal of the first-ever legal framework on AI and a new Coordinated Plan with Member States. The virtual conference offered participants an online space to discuss ethical questions related to AI and underline the need for a special emphasis on the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms when regulating AI. During the event, the progress made by the CAHAI - Ad hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence of the Council of Europe in preparing elements for the Council of Europe legal framework was also presented, giving participants the opportunity to compare the approaches of both standard-setters, the EU and the Council of Europe. Other international organisations were also invited to present their vision and work alongside with views from key stakeholders defending human rights in the context of AI. On the occasion of the conference, Ms Pukonen stated: \u2018The Agency recognises the important role that AI will play in the future, as it is expected to have a significant impact on the work of law enforcement, influencing police models and activities. We need to respond to these developments by offering training opportunities to EU law enforcement officials so that they understand and learn to use these new AI tools, while ensuring the protection of fundamental rights, a key element in all CEPOL training activities. CEPOL is ready to meet this challenge, and has already incorporated AI-related training in its portfolio.

The analysis is based on the responses of 58 law enforcement agencies and EU structures representing a total of 12 801 law enforcement officials. The key findings show that the topics of Victim identification; Combating online violence, distant child abuse and live streaming; Open-Source Intelligence & social media analysis; and Darknet should be given highest priority when designing training activities. As the European Union is founded on the strong commitment towards human rights, the report also emphasizes that the topic of fundamental rights, and in particular children\u2019s rights should be taken into consideration when designing the training portfolios, especially since Child Sexual Exploitation concerns one of the most vulnerable groups in society.

On this, Ms Pukonen noted that CEPOL, as a modern training provider for European law enforcement representatives, recognises the importance of the use of AI and technical innovation by law enforcement agencies for faster and more effective prevention and detection of crimes. CEPOL\u2019s training offer for the upcoming years includes activities aimed at upskilling law enforcement representatives in the use of these technologies for their daily work, notably, in accordance with fundamental rights.

CEPOL was born two decades ago with the resolution to build a community of national police academies, training institutes and universities to help enhance the capacity of police officers across the EU to fight against crime, in particular cross-border crime. Along the way, CEPOL has created bonds of mutual knowledge and understanding between police training institutions all over Europe \u2013those efforts crystallised into the creation of a community-funded EU body, responsible, now under its current mandate, to develop, implement and coordinate training to law enforcement professionals across the European Union, including no just police officers, but also customs officials, judiciary and border guards. Since 2001, CEPOL has trained more than 200,000 law enforcement officials providing a valuable contribution to all EU internal security priority areas, from combatting terrorism and organised crime, to fighting drugs trade and human trafficking and other direct threats to citizens and our European way of life. CEPOL\u2019s Executive Director, Dr. h.c. Detlef Schr\u00f6der, highlighted: The role of CEPOL in supporting the up-skilling of EU law enforcement officials is instrumental to address the EU internal security challenges, especially in times where cross-border cooperation is no longer a matter of debate, but a living reality for all of us, and while we get exposed to new global threats requiring a coordinated response, such as international terrorism, illegal migration, cybersecurity or cybercrime. CEPOL Management Board's Chair, Mr Jose Leit\u00e3o, stated: Over 20 years ago, during the 2000 Portuguese Presidency of the European Union, I was engaged in the discussions that led to the establishment of a network of partners that would become the genesis of CEPOL, which was later settled at Bramshill. It has been impressive to follow the development and growth of the network that became a College and then a fully fledged Agency. I am now proud to chair this Management Board and contribute with the Agency, the partners and the stakeholders to continue to make a safer Europe, through learning. During the online meeting, the Management Board adopted the Consolidated Annual Activity Report 2020. Participants received an update on the list of granted activities in 2022 and the programming principles for 2023. The Management Board members were also informed on the Agency\u2019s Progress Report for the first quarter in 2021, as well as CEPOL\u2019s provisional annual accounts 2020. Relevant agenda points included as well the undergoing EU Training Needs Assessment 2022-2025 and Operational Training Needs Analysis, the setup of CEPOL Knowledge Centres, the new e-Learning products that are on offer to the law enforcement community and the status of the externally EU-funded international cooperation projects currently being led by CEPOL. As a final message, the Slovenian delegation took the floor to announce the EU Law Enforcement working priorities under their upcoming Presidency of the European Union.

The 3-day Conference brought together more than 500 officials from European law enforcement organisations and qualified scholars from universities and research institutions, actively working with law enforcement institutions. The 62 different sessions of the Conference provided an online platform to share knowledge, facts and lessons (to be) learnt, while exploring not only challenges but also new opportunities for the future. 89 speakers, from young PhD holders to internationally leading experts, shared their experience and scientific findings, providing answers to numerous questions regarding the current pandemic situation and its impact on different aspects of law enforcement activities. Among the topics discussed was the role of law enforcement in tackling disinformation campaigns and fake news in pandemic times, as well as policing innovations against domestic abuse during the Covid-19 crisis. Furthermore, the Conference explored how organised crime infiltrated the Covid-19 economy and examined the ways the pandemic affected the mental health of police officers and trainees, offering insights on what could be done to provide support and improve the situation. A special focus was also given to the challenges and creative approaches of police training during the pandemic, with inspiring examples and case studies from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany or Portugal. On the occasion of the completion of the three-day sessions, a panel discussion took place this afternoon, to summarise findings and lessons learned, while opening the floor to future discussions, knowledge sharing and further scientific research on the different topics that were covered during the Conference.

The EU-funded project TOPCOP (Training and Operational Partnership against Organised Crime), coordinated by the EU Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) and supported by the EU Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), recently held its first Strategic Cooperation Forum, a high-level event within the frame of this initiative. This first forum opened a platform for discussion and validation of the selected evidence-based training priorities against the thematic crime priorities to be further integrated into a training portfolio for capacity building of the law enforcement in the Eastern Partnership partner countries. The training portfolio design will be developed by CEPOL, while Europol will lead the Threat Assessment component of the project. Along with representatives of CEPOL, Europol and the European Commission Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement (DG NEAR), the online event was attended by high-level law enforcement authorities, as well as the identified Analysis Single Points of Contact (ANASPOC) and Capacity Building Single Points of Contact (CAPASPOC) of TOPCOP. The meeting was divided into three sessions, of which the first was chaired by CEPOL, whose representative presented the conclusions and the findings of the National Assessment Missions and desk review reports by countries. During the next session, participants were divided into working groups to discuss their specific training needs, challenges and threats in the area of organised crime, based on the report shared with them before the forum. At the last session of the forum, participants agreed on a set of a high-level law enforcement and cooperation priorities in the project context and validated the strategically selected training priorities in line with the EU Policy Cycle as the basis for the detailed Operational Training Needs Assessment (OTNA).

As part of its training portfolio, CEPOL also offers the law enforcement community the possibility to participate in an exchange programme, a European mobility scheme facilitating the exchange of knowledge and experience between officials. However, where it is possible, CEPOL onsite training activities are currently organised online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To participate in CEPOL training activities, law enforcement officials must be registered users of CEPOL\u2019s online learning platform, LEEd. A valid LEEd account provides access to the full range of learning resources, including communities of practice and access to the repository of professional e-Journals and e-books, as well as the new catalogue of online modules for the development of personal business and soft skills.

Detlef Schr\u00f6der participated this morning at the high level European Anti-Racism Summit, co-hosted by the European Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the European Union, in cooperation with the Anti-Racism and Diversity Intergroup of the European Parliament. The Summit focused on the implementation of the European Anti-Racism Action Plan at various levels, with the involvement of EU Institutions, Member States, civil society, equality bodies and grassroots organisations. Taking the floor at the High Level Panel discussion: Tackling racism and racial discrimination through legislation, the Executive Director of CEPOL explained how expressions of racism within the European law enforcement services can be prevented by successful education and training. While underlining the role of CEPOL and its commitment to support a Union of Equality by ensuring that fundamental rights are a cross-cutting priority in all activities the agency\u2019s training portfolio, he noted: To transform even the best anti-racism legislation into practise requires services to ensure the enforcement of these laws and the protection of the vulnerable groups. Law enforcement services in the European Member States need to play an important role to protect all groups and individuals who might be victims of racism. We need to make every possible effort to stop racism in law enforcement, and a key perspective is to ensure the best possible education and training of the officers. CEPOL training activities on hate crime always take into account the topic of racism, as it often leads to expressions of hatred and discrimination. The CEPOL training portfolio for 2021, in particular, includes onsite training activities on Hate Crime and Victim Protection, as well as webinars on Anti-Semitism, Anti-Muslim Hatred, and Hate Crime Recording; in addition, CEPOL offers an Online Module on Hate Crime and will soon add an e-Lesson on Anti-Muslim Hatred (under preparation). In the light of the decision to reinforce its training efforts in the area of Fundamental Rights, CEPOL is establishing a dedicated expert group to foster inclusion of fundamental rights topics in its training activities and to propose improvement for CEPOL\u2019s Fundamental Rights training strategy. Experts from the Member States, the Commission and partner JHA Agencies (EIGE, Europol, FRA) will participate in this group to address, amongst other topics, training on hate crime, racism and discrimination. In 2021, CEPOL is also conducting a new EU Strategic Training Needs Assessment (EU STNA 2022-2025). The desk research, which is expected to be completed by the end of March 2021, includes Fundamental Rights as an umbrella topic. The final report will provide data on the volume of training needs required for racism, discrimination and hate crimes as subtopics. CEPOL is also a member of the High Level Group on combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, set up by the Commission. In addition, the agency co-chairs the Working Group on Hate Crime Training and Capacity Building for National Law Enforcement, which will have its first meeting on 23-24 March. A survey has been conducted by CEJI (A Jewish Contribution to an Inclusive Europe, an international non-profit organisation established in 1991), with the support of CEPOL, to provide a mapping of hate crime training within the EU.

All the qualifications need to be based on ethical values and the respect of rule of law. This is to be treated not as a minor side topic, but as a major horizontal aspect\u2019. The Executive Director of CEPOL concluded by underlining the necessity for police services in Europe to have shared ethical values: \u2018This all has to start from the establishment of such values in the basic training and the constant critical reflection on this during the continuous training. CEPOL is ready to support the police services in the Member States in this challenge\u2019. Based on its 2021 work programme, CEPOL is establishing the Expert Group on Fundamental Rights dedicated to support CEPOL in further improving in the future its focus on fundamental rights and ethics across its training portfolio.

Detlef Schr\u00f6der expresses his gratitude to all contributors and to all those engaged in the editorial work over the last decade: \u201cOur Bulletin has managed to find its place within the European law enforcement communities and the academic circles. I am very grateful for the high-quality contributions submitted over all these years by our authors. I am equally grateful for all those engaged in the editorial work. They, all together, have made possible the well-earned good international reputation that this publication enjoys today.\u201d As could not be otherwise, the Bulletin\u2019s latest edition is headed by an article about the pandemic -an outright topical and learned exploration by experienced criminologist Rob Mawby (UK) of the implications that COVID-19 has had so far and will have on crime patterns and policing. The article takes us in a tour-de-force through some of the available research studies on the virus\u2019s impact on crime rates and shift in the displays of crime and what criminologists could make of it in regard to their theoretical framework. Professor Mawby elaborates how police and policing has been impacted in three distinct ways: enforcement of new legislation, use of new strategies, and deployment of unusual personnel. This number features among other articles the European Code of Police Ethics, Tax Crime, Image Forensics, Domestic Violence and more. There is also a brand new book review section!

It is unique in its kind, designed to support first line officers in MENA countries in the prevention of the flow of Foreign Terrorist Fighters (FTFs) and to counter terrorism in the Air Travel Cycle. It can be used as a relevant technical tool for law enforcement, border control, and customs agencies to effectively implement international instruments, national laws and regulations to counter terrorism and prevent and disrupt terrorist travel. The \u201cAir Travel Cycle\u201d aims to help participants: Understand the applicable international legal framework and policy framework. Increase awareness on the effectiveness of using Advance Passengers Information (API) and Passenger Name Record (PNR) as operational tools to prevent and disrupt the cross-border movement of terrorists and stem the flow of FTFs. Address the different phases that travelers experience in their journeys and the main challenges that immigration and border officers face. Stress the effective use and responsible exchange of biometric data to investigate transnational crime. Underline the importance of respecting international human rights law and commitments while implementing national security legislation and counterterrorism measures. The \u2018Air Travel Cycle\u2019 online module consists of five chapters and will be available on CEPOL\u2019s online learning platform LEEd as of 19 December 2020 for users from MENA countries.

The following articles are now published in the online preview: CORONAVIRUS, CRIME AND POLICING: Thoughts on the implications of the lockdown rollercoaster (Rob Mawby) The coronavirus pandemic has had a major impact on societies across the world. While much of the focus has been on the impact on health and financial wellbeing, crime patterns have also been affected. Correspondingly, police systems, policing, and the legal system within which the police operate, have also changed, less because of the changing crime pattern and more as the police have been empowered with policing health. This exploratory discussion looks at how crime and policing have been affected by the pandemic and speculates about the long-term impact when societies return to a new normal. Limitations in Cross-National Comparative Research (Christiana Vryonidou, Markianos Kokkinos) The Mass Media in Cyprus announced that, according to the Eurostat (2019) \u201cPolice, Court and Prison Personnel Statistics\u201d, Cyprus has the highest ratio of police officers per 100.000 inhabitants among all EU member states. To examine this outcome, the Cyprus Police conducted cross-national research comparing the organization\u2019s population and duties with those of other Law Enforcement Agencies in the European Union. This article will elaborate on the limitations of cross-national comparative research, which the authors came across during the aforementioned study. The European Code of Police Ethics 20 Years On (Stefano Failla) This article reflects a conference contribution as presented by the author on behalf of CEPOL - the EU Agency for law enforcement training, to the Council of Europe conference on the role of police in democratic societies. After a historical examination of the context leading to the publication of the European Code of Police Ethics against the backdrop of the 2004 EU Enlargement after the decade of reforms in the countries of the former Eastern European block, the article examines the importance and the challenges of fundamental rights and police ethics from a training viewpoint ,against the backdrop of the changing landscape of policing in democratic societies. A Practical Approach to Evidence-Based Policing (Gary Cordner) Evidence-based policing remains misunderstood and under-appreciated. This article clarifies what it is, emphasizing its value in informing police practices in conjunction with experience, judgment, and craft knowledge. It also argues for a broad framework simply because policing has a broad mission. In other words, evidence-based policing is more than evidence-based crime control. Data, analysis, and the other tools of science can help police increase their effectiveness across the multiple bottom lines of policing. Council of Europe\u2019s Strategies Regarding Human Rights Training Evaluation (Andre Konze) The Council of Europe is an international organization that promotes and protects human rights. Leaders within the Council of Europe accentuated the importance of effective training and training evaluations since 1993, but human rights training evaluation for law enforcement officials is still not sufficient to fully promote and to protect human rights. Program managers organize and evaluate training for law enforcement officials, but many program managers do not apply the evaluation guidelines of the Council of Europe. The researcher in his exploratory multi-case study interviewed a sample of 11 out of a population of 30 focusing on their strategies to evaluate human right training for law enforcement officials. The theoretical framework that has been applied was Kirkpatrick\u2019s four-level evaluation model. While the first (reaction) and second (learning) level provide assessment for internal validity, the third level assesses the behaviour of participants, and the result level shows the external validity of the program. The leadership style used by the Council of Europe leaders determines their strategies. Transactional leadership might be appropriate to guide program managers to adhere to the evaluation guidelines. However, Council of Europe leaders who follow the transformational leadership approach are more likely to lead their program managers effectively. The findings of the study surprisingly showed that program managers independently developed strategies to evaluate law enforcement training. The qualitative multi-case study promoted an understanding of the strategies used by program managers to evaluate human rights training. The importance of a common definition of tax crime and its impact on criminal countermeasures in the EU: An explorative study (Umut Turksen) Tax crimes have continued to overreach legal clarity, enforcement certainty, fiscal performance and effective public policy in the European Union (EU). The criminal justice countermeasures that have been devised to confront the vitality, intransigence and impacts of tax crimes have consequently been far from being effective and efficient. Guided by the research outputs of an EU funded PROTAX, an advanced solution-hunting research project for tax crimes, this article identifies the uncertainties embedded in the definition of tax crimes in the legal frameworks across the EU Member States as one of the key impediments that weaken the resolve to fight against tax crimes in the EU effectively. By utilising empirical and comparative legal research, this article delves into the main gaps in the criminalisation of tax evasion behaviour. It urges for the development of new methods that can effectively counter tax crimes in the EU. Image/Video Forensics (Fausto Galvan) Images and videos, which have always had a huge impact upon the way people perceive the world and form their convictions, are pervasive in today\u2019s reality more than ever. Even in the forensics scenario, evidences are more and more often composed by multimedia in general and visual data in particular. Since the new meaning of \u201coriginal data\u201d in this digital world requires new approaches to ensure the admissibility of these elements as evidence in a trial, starting from the first years of this century the need to prove the authenticity of a digital evidence became crucial. This work introduces the sub area of Digital Forensics, which has the aim to define and develop the procedures devoted to help operators in this challenging research area. After an introductory part, the topic of this paper was introduced, starting from the meaning of digital evidence, and following with the definition of Image / Video Forensics as a branch of the forensic sciences. Then some methods allowing the extraction of significant information from the images when it is not readily available are examined in detail. Finally, a list of free and non-free software devoted to face the daily challenges coming from processing images and videos for forensic purposes is provided. The work ends with a list of publications containing the Best Practices in the field. Intimate partner violence \u2013 findings and lessons from a national deterrence policy (Eduardo Viegas Ferreira) The ongoing pandemic is highlighting the fragilities of intimate partner violence deterrence in most European countries. The main objective of this research was to identify the outcomes of a national deterrence policy of intimate partner violence, complemented by special protection and support measures for mistreated women. One outcome was an increase in the prosecution and punishment of intimate offenders. The other was an apparent failure to reduce the prevalence of intimate partner violence against women. One of the possible causes for this failure can be a comparatively lower law enforcement investment in the persecution and punishment of intimate offenders. Click here to discover more articles.

Earlier today, the Heads of JHA Agencies came together for a virtual annual meeting, chaired by Eurojust, where they had a first exchange on Artificial Intelligence and digital capacity building, training tools and innovative learning. With the COVID-19 pandemic having served as a catalyst for teleworking and videoconferencing, the agencies agreed to explore avenues for closer cooperation in order to shape the digital future of law enforcement, border management and justice that respects fundamental rights. Eurojust President Mr Ladislav Hamran said: \u2018Seven months ago the JHA agencies were unexpectedly faced with the enormous challenge of providing support to EU Member States in the completely new reality of a pandemic. I am genuinely impressed by how rapidly we adapted to digital working environments while making sure that the cooperation amongst our agencies continued as before. Now we have to take stock of what we have learned from this experience and move towards even greater digitalisation of our operational methods in the future.\u2019 All JHA agencies have been able to continue their operational activities during the COVID-19 pandemic with the help of readily available digital and online communication tools. The pandemic has given new insights into how these virtual ways of working can be optimised and, by sharing their experiences and best practices, the agencies now aim to make optimal use of existing capacities and expertise. At the same time, the increasingly important role of Artificial Intelligence in the agencies\u2019 operational activities calls for closer cooperation in this field. Following today\u2019s discussions, the Heads of JHA agencies agreed to draw up a list of upcoming challenges and opportunities for joint initiatives in the field of digitalisation. Aware of the resources that future digitalisation measures will inevitably require, they called upon the EU institutions to make sure that adequate funding is available. Eurojust chaired today\u2019s meeting and has made digitalisation a priority for the coming years. In close cooperation with the European Commission, the agency will work towards the full digitalisation of judicial cooperation in the EU. With interoperability, secure online communication channels and innovative technologies as its key ingredients, this Digital Criminal Justice project is expected to also benefit other JHA agencies and help streamline interagency cooperation. The nine members of the JHA Agencies Network are: European Asylum Support Office (EASO) ; European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex); European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE); European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA); European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA); European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) ; European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL); European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA); European Union Judicial Cooperation Unit (EUROJUST).

With this exercise, CEPOL aims at having better understanding of where the capability and knowledge gaps lie in those areas. The outcomes of these surveys will contribute to the design of CEPOL\u2019s training portfolio for 2022.

Detlef Schr\u00f6der, has been invited by the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) to share his views on the impact that COVID-19 has had on law enforcement training needs. Participating yesterday at the Committee meeting in the presence of its Chair, Mr Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar, Mr Schr\u00f6der indicated that new crime phenomena and emerging patterns of criminal behaviour have come to the fore as a result of the pandemic. \u201cTo stay ahead of criminals in this fast changing situation, our law enforcement community needs relevant, specifically designed training\u201d, he said. To better understand where the knowledge gaps are, CEPOL carried out this year an analysis of specific training needs that identified areas where upskilling and reinforcement of competences is required. As offenders are shifting their criminal activity to the Internet, cybercrime, open source intelligence and cyber patrolling make up for high priority training areas, explained Mr Schr\u00f6der. Two other fields requiring strengthening of capacities are online investigations and domestic violence, where a substantial increase in cases has been observed as a consequence of the pandemic. Beyond the priority training areas, the pandemic has also unveiled other severe needs with regard to law enforcement training in Member States: with the massive push towards online learning, the lack of solid online infrastructure and appropriate professional capacity to deliver e-learning activities has become evident in some countries. Mr Schr\u00f6der explained that those constraints were immediately detected by CEPOL through their COVID-19 Task Force which articulated a quick response by putting all CEPOL available e-learning infrastructure, resources and expertise to the service of police academies and national training institutions requiring support. Thanks to CEPOL's quick response, more than 3,800 participants have been able to continue receiving training through law training institutions in their countries. Mr Schr\u00f6der\u2019s intervention generated significant interest triggering numerous questions by MEPs Jeroen LENAERS (EPP/NL), Caterina CHINNICI (S&D, IT), Abir AL-SAHLANI (Renew/SE), Tineke STRIK (Greens-EFA/NL) and Birgit SIPPEL (S&D, DE).

In his address, made online via web streaming, Dr. h.c. Schr\u00f6der gave an overview of how the global pandemic crisis has reshaped the serious and organised crime landscape and provided insights about how it has impacted on the law enforcement training ecosystems, pushing education institutions to operate online without being ready yet to take up that challenge. The pandemic outbreak has unveiled emerging gaps with regard to law enforcement training in Member States, such as the lack of solid eLearning infrastructure and online teaching competency. And it has also unveiled the need to enhance collaboration and co-operation. Finding synergies, developing online solutions together and working closer in network mode are crucial success factors if we are to fight serious and organised crime effectively in these days.

To enrol for the Europol Online Module click here or visit CEPOL's e-learning platform LEEd. Europol provides assistance to law enforcement authorities in the EU in the fight against serious international crime and terrorism, as laid out in the Europol Regulation. Its main objective is to support actions by the competent authorities of the Member States in combating serious crime affecting two or more Member States, terrorism, and forms of crime, which affect a common interest covered by an EU policy. It also works with many EU institutions and agencies, non-EU partner countries and international organisations. Europol supports the law enforcement activities of the Member States by providing: information exchange; operational support and expertise, including on-the-spot support and technical support; crime analysis, including both strategic analysis and operational analysis. The module provides information on Europol\u2019s governance, data protection responsibilities and working relationships with its partners and explains in detail the support and expertise that Europol provides to ongoing investigations and operations in the Member States. The module elaborates on knowledge and tools provided by Europol to combat particular crime domains, specifically: counterfeiting and forgery, cybercrime, drugs, weapons and hazardous substances, terrorism, operational financial intelligence and special tactics. Topics such as on-the-spot support, mechanisms (EU Policy Cycle and the EMPACT projects) and information exchange are also addressed, as well as information related to Europol's strategic and operational analysis. The module is an essential and precious training resource that can be used by trainers and educators in their formal courses or law enforcement training curricula. Individual learners can use the module for their professionalization. Through quizzes per topic, the users can test their knowledge.

The purpose of this eLearning activity is to raise awareness about this modern and proactive policing model and present its practical implementation in several key areas to country police officers and law enforcement representatives from Central and Eastern Europe. A modern law enforcement model The OSCE has developed this online module to help law enforcement work together to share data, so that crucial information is not missed. Experience is showing that traditional methods of policing have become more challenging in this digital age. ILP is a modern law enforcement model that aims to change this. Harnessing data and information from a wide range of open and official sources to identify links, trends and patterns can help law enforcement prevent serious incidents or provides long-term insights on threats faced by the public. The scope of ILP goes beyond its use in serious and organised crime, and can be applied to all areas of policing, from burglary or theft to addressing extreme vandalism or ensuring public safety at major events. Participants will be introduced to the main principles of the OSCE Guidebook on ILP, which is available in ten languages (Albanian, Arabic, Bosnian, Croatian, English, Macedonian, Serbian, Russian, Spanish and French) and is actively used by law enforcement agencies and authorities as well as other international organisations both within and outside the OSCE area.\u200b This online training activity is taking place on Tuesday 15th and Wednesday 16th September on CEPOL\u2019s Learning Management System, LEEd.

The European Commission funds this initiative, which is implemented by CEPOL and supported by the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, Europol. As highlighted in the Joint Communication of 28 March on the Eastern Partnership policy beyond 2020, organised crime poses a shared challenge for the European Union and the Eastern Partnership countries. To tackle this challenge, the newly launched project will foster deeper cooperation with EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies to fight organised crime, including economic crime, more effectively. \"We are proud to contribute to the fight against organised crime in our partner countries as well as in the EU. Organised crime networks operate across national borders and by intensifying cooperation, we can make sure crime does not pay. It is our common goal to create a safe and just society for all\u201d, stated Lawrence Meredith, Director for Neighbourhood East at the European Commission. \"CEPOL\u2019s unique role in creating professional training and networking opportunities for law enforcement professionals in the EU and its Neighbourhood is at the heart of CEPOL\u2019s mission.

Catherine De Bolle, Executive Director of Europol, highlighted that: \u201cTOPCOP will improve operational effectiveness and foster more cooperation between the law enforcement authorities of the EU Member States and the Eastern Partnership Countries. Working together is crucial to connect the dots between international criminal networks in the EU and the neighbourhood region. Europol\u2019s position at the centre of the European law enforcement architecture enables us to facilitate cooperation in the region\u201d. TOPCOP aims at improving operational effectiveness across the partner countries in the Eastern Partnership. It will also reinforce the nexus between law enforcement training and operations and provide an up-to-date situational picture of the threat organised crime poses to the region. The project will create networks of capacity-building contact points to help close any gaps between law enforcement training and operational law enforcement efforts. It will also identify learning needs with a view to providing regional and targeted training based on evidence and commonalities. The project will make full use of CEPOL\u2019s and Europol\u2019s long standing respective expertise in assessing and delivering on law enforcement training needs, and on analysing crime data with a view to support international law enforcement cooperation. The European Union has committed EUR 6 million for this initiative, which will last for a 48 months period.

Outcomes of this analysis will be used to develop specific training products on domestic violence for law enforcement officials across Europe. This report follows through the analysis addressing the impact of COVID-19 on law enforcement training needs issued by CEPOL last July, which signalled a substantial increase in domestic violence cases as a consequence of the pandemic. To get better insights to the specifics of these cases and to explore how law enforcement officials should be prepared to addressing them, CEPOL launched in July a specific assessment exercise on the impact of COVID-19 on domestic violence. To carry out this report, CEPOL has consulted operational actors in EU Member States and experts from the IMPRODOVA project, the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) and the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). With a response rate to the survey of 81% percent, the report concludes that there is high need for training of law enforcement on how to address domestic violence cases independently of COVID-19. The research suggests that the widespread nature of domestic violence and the gaps in knowledge skills and competencies of law enforcement in this topic call for EU-level intervention in terms of training. Interestingly, in most of responding Member States (72%), the trends show that COVID-19 had an impact on crime patterns in domestic violence, although those have emerged in different ways across countries. The report identifies as possible training needs those connecting to safety measures applied when contacting people, be it an entry to a house, an interrogation, or an interview; alternative ways of getting into contact with and help victims applying new technologies; conducting interviews, interrogations via digital tools; and psychological impact of quarantine.

In the past months, all JHA agencies have taken the necessary measures to ensure business continuity and uninterrupted operational support. At the same time, the Justice and Home Affairs agencies' network (JHAAN), under the chairmanship of Eurojust, has initiated a dialogue to share their experiences in dealing with the pandemic and consider new avenues for closer cooperation among the agencies and with key stakeholders inside and outside the EU. The agencies\u2019 individual and joint efforts to deal with the impact of the pandemic have been captured in a Joint Paper on the COVID-19 response by the JHA agencies, which was formally endorsed by the heads of JHA agencies during a videoconference held on 9 July. During their meeting, the heads discussed the latest developments, including the fundamental rights implications of government COVID-19 measures, the quick adaptation of organised crime to the changing circumstances and the recent surge in drug use, domestic violence and child abuse. To tackle these and other issues more effectively related to the protection of citizens and freedoms, there is a need for increased interagency cooperation in the field of digitalisation and for sustainable financial resources in the coming years. The COVID-19 pandemic coincides with the 10th anniversary of the Justice and Home Affairs agencies' network.

The analysis attempts to identify those areas where training reinforcement is deemed to be needed as a result of the changes in crime patterns observed and the challenges on the operational level as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. To carry out this report, CEPOL has consulted operational actors and centres of expertise in the areas of criminality addressing the most salient threats to the EU internal security, the so-called EMPACT areas: cybercrime, drug trafficking, facilitation of illegal immigration, organised property crime, trafficking in human beings, excise and MTIC fraud, Illicit firearms trafficking, environmental crime, criminal finances and money laundering, and document fraud. The results are based on data from almost 200 responses from EU Member States, EU agencies, the European Commission, the European Council, non-EU countries and international organisations. The report, which outlines around 50 specific training needs, recommends addressing changed crime patterns and modi operandi in all criminal areas on the short term. On a mid-term perspective, the analysis advocates that training shall enhance the knowledge of officials in cyber investigations, use of open source intelligence and e-evidence on general level and in crime specific way. For the longer run, the report proposes training should share best practices on how to reorganise the work on operational level to ensure smooth operations and high level performance of protection of officials.

This strong increase in participation confirms a trend observed by the Agency since 2015: a 20 percent increase in outreach year over year. Also noteworthy is the aggregate data for the last decade: over 150,000 law enforcement officials from EU Member States and third countries have been trained by CEPOL. Per thematic areas, almost half of all participants last year (46%) enrolled in training activities tackling critical security threats stemming from the European Agenda on Security, such as Serious and organised crime. Examples of sub-areas within this activity focus include money laundering and criminal finance; facilitated illegal immigration, trafficking in human beings, the various forms of cybercrime, excise and MTIC fraud, drugs trafficking, environmental crime, organised property crime, document fraud and firearms trafficking. Understanding the fact that cybercrime is one of the fastest evolving and expanding criminal area in serious organised and transnational crime, CEPOL further intensified its efforts to provide effective trainings in that particular area. Other in-demand training areas were Law enforcement cooperation tools, professional networks information exchange (26% out of total participants), Counterterrorism (7% out of total participants); and Soft skill-building, leadership training and language skills (5% out of total participants). Online learning, training solution of choice for 85% of participants The Agency implemented last year a total of 327 training activities: one hundred of those activities were Residential and 142 e-Learning training, while 57 of the initiatives organised fell under the objective \u2018Capacity Building in Third Countries\u2019, and 28 under the Exchange Programme. Online learning represented last year the training solution of choice for 85 percent of participants. The most attended type of e-Learning training were CEPOL webinars, with more than 18,500 participants registered; followed by the online modules, with 9,364. Other successful online training formulas include courses, virtual training centres and cyber bites. Under the General CEPOL Exchange Programme, 468 exchanges were successfully implemented thereby having an implementation percentage of 141% (versus planned 330 exchanges). The CEPOL-Frontex Joint Exchange Programme, fully funded by Frontex, succeeded in implementing a total of 94 exchanges. In terms of quality, CEPOL products, as measured by the stakeholders\u2019 satisfaction rate, remained exceptionally high with overall 96% of participants stating that they were very satisfied or satisfied with the training received. This shows that CEPOL\u2019s efforts to provide relevant, actual and practically applicable learning and training actions in the context of the EU internal security challenges have been successful. [1] The figure refers to participants in CEPOL training activities, which includes individuals who may have participated in multiple courses.

With fact-based analysis by experts and frontline experience from across EU Member States, the conference focused on the impact of the pandemic on the law enforcement practice in Europe. The event provided an opportunity to learn about policing strategies enforced and rolled out in countries such as France, Italy, Belgium and Croatia in response to Covid-19 and to shine light on the new array of challenges law enforcement bodies faced in view of the coronavirus spread. In the afternoon, the conference featured the participation of relevant European and international bodies such as Europol, Frontex, Eurojust and Interpol, whose representatives revealed some of the key findings of the analysis undertaken in their respective areas of competence. In her keynote speech, Director-General of the European Commission\u2019s Migration and Home Affairs\u2019 department, Ms Monique Pariat, stated: \u201cSolidarity, coordination, synergies are nice words we can all identify with, but these must be translated into concrete actions. [..] The unprecedented situation we are in at the moment has shown, once again, and hopefully to everyone, that we need much more Europe in finding solutions for our citizens\u201d. Referring to the expectations from the law enforcement in the context of the immense impact of COVID-19 on our societies, State Secretary from the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Croatia, Mr \u017darko Kati\u0107, emphasized: \"Both law enforcement and judicial authorities need to respond to the new criminal threats by adjusting the operational methods to the new environment.\" Mr Kati\u0107 further pointed out \"the need for swift and secure communication between authorities in this crisis as one of the main conditions to ensure operational work. Consequently, this is reflected in the growing demand by law enforcement authorities for online trainings and for smart solutions which would enable such communication,\u201d he concluded. Along these lines, CEPOL\u2019s Executive Director, Dr.h.c. Detlef Schr\u00f6der, underlined: \u201cThe current pandemic crisis has evidenced how fast and agile nowadays learning and training services need to be to prepare law enforcement for the emerging challenges. We know how challenging it has been for many training institutes in Europe to shift towards online services; and we have discovered the limitations of this choice. However, we have also seen the great potential behind online tools to achieve effective learning experiences.\u201d Covid-19 specific online training Mr Schr\u00f6der seized the opportunity to announce that the Agency is conducting, in cooperation with the Council of the EU, an analysis on the impact of Covid-19 on investigations and training needs. The outcomes of this analysis will serve as a basis for the design of Covid-19 specific online training aimed at enhancing the knowledge, skills and competencies of law enforcement officials across Europe.

The operational results of EMPACT (European Multidisciplinary Cooperation Platform Against Criminal Threats) in 2019 have been presented at the video conference of home affairs ministers held today. Last year\u2019s all these EU joint efforts to combat crime led to 8 000 arrests. Additionally, more than 1 400 victims of trafficking in human beings and online child pornography were identified, more than 400 million euros in fraud affecting the interests of the EU were prevented, and 75 tonnes of drugs seized. Also, more than 72 million euros\u2019 worth of criminal assets were frozen and seized. Looking beyond the operational results, the integrated and multidisciplinary character of EMPACT, which also includes prevention and training, is a key factor for the success of this tool. CEPOL makes a vital contribution to EMPACT through training, collaborating with other relevant actors, ranging from the competent authorities in Member States to the EU agencies and institutions, the external partners and the private sector. The multidisciplinary approach of EMPACT provides a strong common platform for a broad range of actors at national and EU level, including police, border guards, customs, judicial authorities, labour inspectors and private sector operators, to mention just some. It has helped to increase mutual trust, and allowed for a more flexible and coordinated approach to respond to the complex and ever-evolving nature of crime.

As a response to the increasing need among law enforcement officers to access electronic evidence for internet-based investigations, CEPOL is launching in June the SIRIUS E-Evidence Series in collaboration with Europol and Eurojust, and within the frame of the SIRIUS project. This training series will consist of six self-paced online learning sessions that will be gradually released throughout the month of June in LEEd, CEPOL\u2019s new online learning platform. These high-quality trainings will help investigators cope with the complexity and the volume of information in a rapidly changing online environment, by providing them precise guidelines on specific Online Service Providers (OSPs) and Emergency Disclosure Requests. The SIRIUS e-Evidence Series will also include specific training addressing common mistakes with direct requests for electronic evidence as well as the legal aspects of direct access, cross border production orders and international judicial cooperation. The efficiency of using Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) to gather exchange evidence, in particular in cybercrime cases, will be the focus of one of the last sessions planned. This first session of the series, which will be delivered by EUROPOL experts, is expected to be available in LEEd next week (Cyber-related crimes) *About SIRIUS project: SIRIUS is a secure web platform for law enforcement professionals, which allows them to share knowledge, best practices and expertise in the field of internet-facilitated crime investigations, with a special focus on counter-terrorism. It offers an innovative collaborative approach by providing investigators with a platform to quickly and efficiently exchange know-how, manuals and advice, as well as tools to help them analyse the information received by the different online service providers. The platform also addresses other challenges in criminal investigations, such as streamlining the requests to online service providers, and improving the quality of the responsive record.

The pandemic outbreak has unveiled other emerging severe needs with regard to law enforcement training in Member States: the lack of solid online infrastructure in some countries. Pukonen pointed out that these were immediately detected by CEPOL through their COVID-19 Task Force -set up in March- which articulated a quick response by putting all available e-learning infrastructure, resources and expertise to the service of those training institutions requiring support.

In practical terms, CEPOL has made available the use of its GoTo Applications licenses, enabling the organisation of online meetings from 25 up to 500 attendees; additionally, CEPOL has offered granting law enforcement communities access to its own learning management platform, allowing to create collective learning spaces where to continue training activities virtually. A total of 12 Member States and several EU agencies and partner organisations that closely cooperate with CEPOL reacted positively to the offering. Up until now, law enforcement academia in 7 Member States have engaged in specific cooperation agreements to benefit from the Agency\u2019s robust online technology and e-learning infrastructure alongside the solid experience of its staff in delivering distance learning and facilitating online meetings. From the assistance provided by CEPOL, two examples show case the difficulties encountered by training organisations at national level in the face of the COVID-19 crisis and the practical role the Agency is playing in unblocking their situation.

Only in March, CEPOL saw a 10 percent increase in the number of registrations in webinar and online courses. Nine e-learning activities were delivered with a total of 1,174 registered participants. Besides, CEPOL\u2019s Cyber Crime Academy online products have enabled over 1,300 officials to keep pace with the latest cybercrime trends. Moreover, a COVID-19 Task Force has recently been set up to better address specific needs of Member States and JHA agencies on training and education of law enforcement officials during these difficult times, by leveraging CEPOL\u2019s existing online technology and e-learning infrastructure.

CEPOL's Executive Director, Dr.h.c Detlef Schr\u00f6der, commented on the new eLearning platform: \u201cThe emergence of new eLearning solutions and technologies is constantly transforming the landscape of education. With LEEd, CEPOL places its eLearning strategy into the orbit of advanced technological education solutions for law enforcement training in Europe. This is a an important milestone in our journey to improve the quality of our learning and to enrich all our training programmes. We are very pleased to see LEEd rolling out\u201d. As of today, LEEd will be migrating away from eNet, CEPOL\u2019s current eLearning management system, which registers today around 30,000 online training users. Unlike eNet, LEEd offers CEPOL\u2019s training activities grouped into thematic areas. This constitutes a clear shift in the look and the way CEPOL presents its digital learning and training portfolio to its audience across the European Union and third countries. In addition to the training offer, the platform offers research and science resources in the form of a repository of documents with browsing and filter capabilities by categories. LEEd also includes a forum for the users to communicate among themselves and publish or modify content; a connection with the EBSCO Discovery Service to consult e-books and e-journals; and a space for conference management. The platform also allows closer collaboration with other partners and organisations from the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) agencies' network through a new Virtual Training Centre. This new e-learning environment will be soon made available to iOS and Android phone users through a mobile app. At a later stage, it will also integrate an innovative events\u2019 log with all upcoming training activities. All e-Net users are receiving today an email with detailed instructions on how to activate their accounts on LEEd.

The content of the module has been formally adopted by Management Board Decision 1/2020/MB. In the updated module, a distinction is made between cybercrime and cyber-enabled crime. The latter is becoming an increasingly more critical phenomenon for law enforcement agencies to tackle in these days where internet technology becomes omnipresent in our every-day life, including crime. The module describes different forms of these crimes and, through EMPACT, the European response to this. Dedicated priority areas such as cyber-attacks against information systems, non-cash means of payment fraud and child sexual exploitation are covered in the module. The module is an essential and precious training resource that can be used by trainers and educators in their formal courses or law enforcement training curricula. Individual learners can use the module for their professionalisation. Through quizzes per topic, the user can test their knowledge. Upon successful completion of all quizzes, a certificate is issued.

During the update, the latest developments on Darknet markets as well as implications for law enforcement are described. Darknets are increasingly being used to conduct criminal activities because of the anonymity that they provide to their users.

These include illicit goods, stolen items, fake documents, illicit content and cybercrime enablers. The Darknet module is intended for people new to the darknet, or with a small amount of knowledge and who want to know more. It is designed to provide a general understanding of the darknet, the way criminals use it, and how technology supports them. After completing the module, the user should be able to explain the darknet to others, to recognise how someone might be involved in darknet crime, and to know some of the investigation tools needed to manage the threats.

Prof. Fijnaut is a distinguished academic who has done pioneer research work on the roots of cross-state-border cooperation in Europe and the various political and legal levels of implementation (read more about the speakers background here: Dirk Van Daele (2019): Cyrille Fijnaut: a pioneer from the low countries, Police Practice and Research, DOI: 10.1080/15614263.2019.1690178 In this Public Webinar, the following points will be elaborated: The debate surrounding police and judicial cooperation in the European Union can be criticised for focussing too much on certain forms of cooperation or on specific problems. It lacks as a result, a thorough overview of what has been achieved in this area since the Maastricht Treaty. In contrast to the disjointed and mostly secret cooperation between police and judicial services in Europe prior to 1993, the current regime has established a coherent and transparent system within the EU that can only be described as something like peaceful revolution. The presenter aims to portray this development in light of the EU-wide political action programmes (the Brussels Programme, the Tampere Programme, the Hague Programme and the Stockholm Programme) which were drafted in concurrence with all major changes to the constitutional relations within the EU. This programmatic approach makes it possible to present in a clear manner the imposing array of police and judicial agencies, facilities and networks (Europol, Schengen Information System, Eurojust, European Arrest Warrant, etc.) created through democratic processes with the aim of ensuring the security of the citizens of the EU. In particular, the problems concerning the control of internal and external borders and with respect to the containment of terrorism demonstrate that this system urgently needs to be reinforced. It is ironic that the Brexit negotiations demonstrate the importance of the current system of police and judicial cooperation in the EU: the United Kingdom would like to keep the great benefits of a number of its crucial components. The webinar is intended to be interactive and participants can share questions in advance on CEPOL\u2019s social media channels or submit them during the session (chat-log).

CEPOL Exchange Programme might be just the right answer to your needs. The call for participants of this CEPOL\u2019s flagship activity has just been opened. Interested Law Enforcement officials can contact their National Exchange Coordinators through their CEPOL National Units (list of contacts available here). This Erasmus-style exchange programme run by CEPOL since 2007, allows law enforcement officers to spend one week with a counterpart in their country, exchanging knowledge and good practices, initiating cooperation projects and fostering deep and long-lasting learning and networking opportunities. It is an excellent opportunity to improve your knowledge and to open new horizons in the way of investigating. A totally practical approach to other law enforcement and the best way to increase your professional network. (\u2026) We cannot forget also its human dimension, to meet different cultures, to better understand them in both dimensions: on a professional and a personal level \u2013 underlines Rafael Puentes Hern\u00e1ndez, Police Officer - Debriefing Expert from Malaga, Spain and participant of CEPOL\u2019s flagship exchange programme (June 2017, in France). The programme seeks to enhance cooperation in combating crime \u2013 explains Detlef Schr\u00f6der, CEPOL\u2019s Executive Director - it is based on mobility, mutual learning and provides participants with an opportunity to familiarise themselves with working methods of other countries. Such exchanges promote trust and cooperation between law enforcement officers from across Europe and beyond. The programme fulfils one of CEPOL\u2019s key objectives - developing a European law enforcement culture. It allows participants to spend a week (Monday - Friday) with a counterpart in a chosen hosting country. It is open to law enforcement officers from all EU Member States, EU Candidate Countries, Western Balkan and European Neighbourhood Policy Eastern Partnership countries. The principle of the Exchange Programme is that the exchange should be done on a bilateral basis. Each sending country also functions as a hosting country, i.e. each exchangee goes to one and is also expected to host the colleague from the country s/he visited. Each exchange is organised around one specific topic. To take part in an exchange, participants must: have a minimum of three years\u2019 work experience in the field of interest; have a reasonable level of English (at least level B1) which enables them to communicate with colleagues about enforcing the law on the selected topic; have a need and readiness for individual learning; commit to cascading their newly gained knowledge to colleagues at a national and European level.

On 22 November, the Heads of the nine EU Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) agencies met at Europol\u2019s headquarters in The Hague. The discussions focused on the implementation of the New Strategic Agenda 2019-2024, the state-of-play of the interoperability project and the common efforts in reinforcing diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Europol hosted their annual meeting in the framework of its 2019 chair of the JHA agencies\u2019 network. During its chair, Europol has also organised five expert meetings on information technologies and cybersecurity, diversity and inclusion, media relations, training, and data protection. The outcome of the meetings that took place under Europol\u2019s chair will serve for the drafting of a joint strategic report with recommendations for the EU Council on the future Internal Security Strategy. The different areas of cooperation and subjects relevant to JHA agencies discussed during the meeting and throughout the Europol chair in 2019 clearly demonstrate the crucial role of the agencies in the EU area of justice, security and freedom. While each and every agency is doing its utmost to deliver results according to its respective mandate, there are several horizontal challenges which can be addressed only through even closer inter-agency cooperation. In 2020, Eurojust will follow Europol as chair of the JHA Agencies Network.

During the meeting, the agencies\u2019 representatives have signed a formal engagement to champion equality and ensure equal opportunities for all staff members while embracing their diversity. The common statement highlights the importance of inclusive corporate culture and strong diversity values to increase staff engagement, cohesion and organisational delivery.

The meeting is presided by Mr Kimmo Himberg, Director of the Police University College and the Chair of CEPOL\u2019s Management Board. The meeting takes place at the same place where the idea of CEPOL was conceived 20 years ago at the European Council special meeting. On that note, the Chair comments: CEPOL now goes back to its roots: the decision to establish the agency was made in the EU Summit in Tampere 20 years ago. The meeting of 1999 is considered one of the most important meetings in the history of the EU. At that time, the EU member states agreed on a common European police college that will assemble all institutions offering law enforcement training in Europe The opening speech at the meeting was given by Mr Seppo Kolehmainen, Finnish National Police Commissioner. The MB members will be deciding on CEPOL\u2019s common future guidelines and operating policies. They will also be given an update on the STNA and capacity building projects in third countries. The Management Board will also be presented with CEPOL\u2019s new online platform \u2013 Law Enforcement Education (LEEd), which is expected to replace the current e-net in the beginning of 2020. The Agency currently plays an important role in law enforcement cooperation: CEPOL provides training for the police, customs, border guard and prosecution authorities of EU Member States. In 2018, a total of 29,000 persons participated in CEPOL\u2019s training activities, including the exchange programme. This figure is estimated to raise in 2019. The cooperation helps to combat, for example, cross-border crime. CEPOL is in key position to provide information on new methods through which we can more successfully prevent, investigate and combat crime, says Himberg. The Management Board meeting represents one of the highlights of the Police University College\u2019s CEPOL presidency and is an official side event of Finland\u2019s EU presidency. You can follow the meeting on social media with the hashtag #cepolMB. The CEPOL Management Board is made up of representatives from EU Member States and the EU Commission. The Chair of the Management Board is a representative of one of the three Member States that have jointly prepared the Council of the European Union\u2019s 18-month programme.

Three of them received special academic recognition for their outstanding results and excellent thesis defence: Paolo Cestra (Italy), Maria Montserrat Marin Lopez (Spain) and Natalja Prokofjeva (Latvia). Representing 20 EU Member States, the group of EJMP graduates completed this summer a 2-year-long academic programme addressing common challenges of police cooperation in the frame of internal security. Organised for the second time by the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) in consortium with 21 partner academies, the master studies were divided into seven modules, implemented by seven different countries: Estonia, Italy, Finland, Hungary, Lithuania, Netherlands (together with the UK) and Romania. Addressing the graduates at the ceremony, Commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos congratulated them for having worked hard and reaching this important step forward in their career, and thanked CEPOL staff for their guidance through this enriching process. The role of police officers is becoming vastly more important, more multi-faceted and more complex simply because today\u2019s security environment does not stop at any border, is less predictable and more quickly evolving than at any time in recent memory. CEPOL can and will play a decisive role in ensuring security in EU and prepare police officers to do their jobs effectively\u2019 \u2013 he underlined. CEPOL Executive Director, Detlef Schr\u00f6der emphasised on his pride arising from the excellent academic quality provided in the programme by dedicated partner universities: In the broad portfolio of training options our Agency provides, higher education at university level is a core element. It is an evidence CEPOL can deliver, complementary to the multi-fold operational hands-on activities, the highest-level academic qualifications together with its influential partner universities. Director-General of the Hungarian Ministry of Interior, K\u00e1roly Papp, in his speech stressed a continuous need to invest further in the most critical value of the police services - their human resources. Whereas the Rector of the Spanish National Distance Education University (UNED), Ricardo Mairal Us\u00f3n, underlined the privilege of his institution to award the diplomas to the programme graduates. Sergio Felgueiras, the Consortium leader, praised the programme for \u2018the opportunity to change the mindset of students with the knowledge they get. Danijela Petkovi\u0107, Deputy Chair of the CEPOL Management Board, wished the former students to be able to transfer gained knowledge contributing to the establishment of a European community of practice. The graduates\u2019 spokesperson, Hugo Cruz, concluded on their behalf: More than receiving the diploma, our biggest aim is to be able to apply our knowledge for an effective and efficient international law enforcement cooperation and contribute to building a safer Europe. CEPOL European Joint Master Programme is unique and complementary to the Higher Education Programme, and to any existing master programmes on policing across the EU Member States. It fully complies with the Bologna Declaration for Higher Education and the Dublin Descriptors, which are recognised by all universities in the European Union. This alignment warrants the academic quality and consistency of the European Joint Master Programme. The EJMP is addressed to senior law enforcement officers or experts in general management and specialist positions, who intend to gain or improve competences in the field of international and European police and law enforcement management. The EJMP is a significant learning programme in CEPOL\u2019s portfolio and is dedicated to the legal and operational aspects of international and European police cooperation.

Those key findings include a necessity to train them on awareness of cultural differences, first contact communication, basic profiling skills or document fraud expertise, to name the few. The report also provides a comprehensive analysis of the training needs for different audiences involved in the area. It points out, i.e. a need for OSINT techniques training for criminal investigators, courses on nationality screening or securing evidence for border guards or more accessible paths for cooperation with financial investigators or asset recovery officers for the judges and prosecutors. It also highlights some neglected areas like training on national legal frameworks of the countries of deployment for immigration liaison officers or profiling skills for VISA and Consular staff. Good knowledge of English in general and specific legal terminology as well as good knowledge of further relevant foreign languages has also been perceived as persistent and urgent training need across various profiles.

The role of the CEPOL in training law enforcement services in the Union and its neighbourhood constitutes a strategic investment in European security \u2013 he stressed, while adding - The internal and external security of the Union have become so intertwined that it is no longer possible to treat them separately. Based on evidence provided by the Member States on EU\u2019s security threats, CEPOL\u2019s Executive Director referred to the Agency\u2019s recent study 'EU wide Strategic Training Needs Assessment', requesting to close many core capability gaps, that EU law enforcement communities are facing.

The Strategic Training Needs Assessment ( EU STNA) addressed these days to both Council\u2019s Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security (COSI) and to the meeting of Executive Directors of EU Justice and Home Affairs Agencies in Vilnius, also suggests such training to address deficiencies in the areas of information exchange and cross-border cooperation. Referring to the document, Detlef Schr\u00f6der, CEPOL\u2019s Executive Director, underlines some key features an ideal EU law enforcement training shall provide: \u201cTraining is essential to allow authorities on the ground to exploit the tools in an operational situation. It needs to take into account not only recent policy developments or criminal modus operandi innovations but also a deeper insight into technology changes, especially digitalisation. Ideally, it would bring together not only law enforcement officials but also prosecution, judiciary, tax authorities or even private parties, especially from the banking or NGO sectors. That would provide an exchange of good practices on the one hand and improved convergence on the other. So, that is what we are aiming at in CEPOL.\u201d To build an efficient and coordinated training portfolio addressing internal security threats of the EU, the report suggests performing the following actions between actors involved: Improved mapping of available training initiatives More detailed analysis by agencies within their planning cycles, stronger cooperation and coordination among EU level training providers; Raising awareness on available training opportunities Development of common standards for training on specific law enforcement work areas. Finally, all three European Institutions with whom the findings of the EU-STNA report have been shared (European Commission, Council of the EU and the European Parliament) have been invited to provide strategic guidance and set up law enforcement training priorities for 2019-2021. Cross-border multidisciplinary and interdepartmental cooperation and training are critical to a successful fight against serious and organised crime and terrorism. * The core capability gaps of law enforcement officials that can and shall be addressed by training include the following cross cutting thematic categories: Open Source Intelligence, data collection, analysis and application; Financial investigations, money flows, alternative banking, etc.; Elements of cyber-investigations, darknet and e-evidence; Document fraud; Fundamental and human rights; Crime prevention; Respective areas of forensics; Links between different crime areas. As well as information exchange and cross-border cooperation related: Information exchange mechanisms, interoperability of the large scale IT systems, information exchange channels and procedures, including evidence handling, databases, Passenger Name Records (PNR), other, and with a special focus on the Schengen Information System, as well as other upcoming large scale IT systems (ETIAS and Entry-Exit System); EU cooperation tools and mechanisms, including Joint Investigation Teams (JITs), the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), freezing order, etc.; and the role and possibilities of the respective EU agencies and other entities. EU-STNA aims at assessing strategic training needs and address EU priorities in the area of internal security and its external aspects, intending to better coordinate training activities for law enforcement officials and avoid duplication of efforts among EU training providers (Union agencies and other relevant bodies). EU-STNA is a detailed examination and identification among EU priorities in the area of internal security, of those priorities with a training dimension, and that should be tackled with training activities at the EU level.

EIGE is currently making an analysis of the risk assessment procedures and risk management strategies for intimate partner violence applied by the police within the Member States. 'Police officers are often the first authority to be called when violence at home happens and in many societies trust in police needs to be raised. Together with CEPOL we want to increase the knowledge of how to better protect victims of intimate partner violence from further harm', said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s Director. The meeting aimed at contributing to the development of guidelines for risk assessment and recommendations for risk management in this area whilst drawing on the main findings from: a legal and policy analysis in the EU Member States (EU-MS); current research developments; a comparative analysis of current practices in EU-MS; the list of identified risk factors for intimate partner violence against women.

Combating all forms of gender-based violence against woman and girls is a fundamental pillar of the respect for human or fundamental rights and remains a priority for the EU, both internally and externally.

All supporters of this campaign declare that they will never commit, condone or remain silent about violence against women, and also promise to raise awareness of the issue and to work within whichever means possible towards ending it. The campaign goes back to a young Canadian man who shot 14 women in 1989 and injured many others because they were women. In the aftermath of this cruel attack, starting in Canada 1991, more and more men (!) have expressed themselves clearly and publicly against violence against women worldwide. The platform for this pledge is the White Ribbon campaign. There are \"normal\" supporters and \"ambassadors\" for this campaign. The pins (\u201cribbon\u201d) for the Ambassadors can be worn on 25th November (International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women) or 8 March (International Women's Day).

Prof. hc. Dr. B\u00e1nfi Ferenc explained how CEPOL contributed to a safer Europe through training, with a special emphasis on tackling pressing security issues, such as terrorism, illegal migration, cybercrime and drug trafficking. CEPOL worked closely with EU Member States (first and foremost via the dedicated CEPOL National Units), countries in Eastern and South-East Europe, Middle East and North Africa, Justice and Home Affairs agencies and international organisations such as Interpol, OSCE and UNODC to create a portfolio of activities that supported the EU political priorities in terms of security. This demonstrated the growing importance of external relations within CEPOL\u2019s new legal mandate and the high level CEPOL\u2019s appreciation at global level. In 2016, CEPOL has reached new records in terms of participation: over 18 000 officials from 39 countries were trained during 87 residential activities, 492 exchanges, 87 webinars and other e-learning tools. The satisfaction rate is excellent and raises at 95%. Another important milestone was the XIII Research and Science Conference held in October 2016 in Budapest. It brought together law enforcement professionals from all around the world, amongst them the Secretary General of Interpol and the Director of Europol. Mr G\u00e1bor Zupk\u00f3, Head of the European Commission Representation to Hungary, took the floor and congratulated CEPOL to the achievements. He emphasised the need for the EU Member States to work more closely together on two issues: economic innovation and security. He highlighted the fact that Hungary hosts two EU agencies, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) and the European Institute for Innovation (EIT), that are active in both these fields, which gives Hungary a strategic position at EU level. Moreover, he announced the future visit to Hungary of Sir Julian King, EU Commissioner for Security Union, to discuss EU security issues. Mr. J\u00e1nos Szacs\u00fari, Head of Department at the Hungarian Ministry of Interior, praised the good cooperation with CEPOL.

CEPOL \u2013 the European Police College - has been existing for 15 years. Thousands of police officers from all over Europe and beyond have improved their skills and knowledge through CEPOL\u2019s training activities and by participating in the European Police Exchange Programme. In the current times of changes and in such a dynamic environment, CEPOL is moving forward through innovation and creativity. Dr Ferenc B\u00e1nfi, Director of CEPOL, is proud of the achievements of the agency. \u201cCEPOL\u2019s training has improved in the past 15 years to be more effective and efficient. Just to give an example: in 2010 we trained about 2400 police officers, and in 2015 they were close to 13000. But this quantitative growth did not overshadow the quality of the training. The satisfaction rate of our training is 94%, and that is based on the judgement of the course participants.\u201d There have been some more achievements for CEPOL in these 15 years. \u201cWe grew from an intergovernmental organisation to an EU agency, and now we have a new legal mandate stepping forward again. We are more responsive to the changing criminal environment, and the agency satisfies the legitimate training needs of the European law enforcement community. CEPOL is integrated into the European security architecture. We are a prestigious partner of Justice and Home Affairs agencies, and we are an acknowledged key player for law enforcement training. We have achieved this by delivering excellent learning products, not only by CEPOL, but also by all members of our training network.\u201d Changes The coming years will not be less dynamic, according to Dr B\u00e1nfi.\u201cThe future could be summarised in one word: changes. Everything is changing: our lives, technology, our security environment. You have to keep moving. Through innovation and with creativity, CEPOL has to look for solutions every day and every hour. The complexity of the challenge and to manage this organisation in a dynamic environment is what makes us motivated and inspired.\u201d The implementation of the new mandate for CEPOL is fastly approaching: it will enter into force on the 1st of July. The new legal mandate offers opportunities to CEPOL.\u201cWe are not only to train police officers in the future, but also other law enforcement colleagues. For example customs, border security officers or prosecutors with regards to international law enforcement cooperation. Based on a strategic training needs assessment - which is under preparation in close cooperation with the European Commission - CEPOL will develop an adequate training portfolio to serve the law enforcement community.\u201d The new legal frame gives CEPOL more opportunities to work more globally and to enhance its partnership by cooperating with private partners.\u201cThis way we can improve the quality of training and therefore the quality of the police services in Europe.\u201d Trust The most important tool to enhance cooperation within the law enforcement community is trust.\u201cWhen law enforcement officials work together, they have to completely trust each other.

CEPOL is now the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training. What impact will that decision have on CEPOL? The new legal basis presents several key features: The agency becomes the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training, while the acronym remains the same - CEPOL. A wider target group of \u201claw enforcement officials\u201d is now identified as the community CEPOL should serve. CEPOL is given a coordination and implementation role, and is mandated to address the European dimension of serious and organised crime, terrorism, public order, and CSDP preparedness. The CEPOL Secretariat disappears and its staffs become the staff of the agency. The current Governing Board becomes a Management Board (with the European Commission as voting member), gaining powers of Appointing Authority and further competences in determining CEPOL\u2019s internal organisation. The Director is now Executive Director. The role of the Executive Director is reinforced by granting him the responsibility to make proposals to the Management Board, and implement both the budget and the work programme(s). The appointment mechanism of the Executive Director is also modified to include the European Commission. CEPOL National Contact Points (NCPs) become CEPOL National Units (CNUs). An 18-months Chairmanship of the European Council presidency is established. CEPOL is a fully fledged EU agency in terms of legal construction, tasked inter alia to bring together a network of law enforcement training institutes. A number of new tasks have been attributed to the agency, such as those related to assessing EU initiatives in defined fields, building the capacity of third countries, providing multiannual Strategic Training Needs Assessments, and the promotion of mutual recognition of training among EU Member States. The width of CEPOL\u2019s remit in the area of research relevant for training and external relations has been extended. CEPOL shall establish a Scientific Committee for Training. CEPOL assumes a leading role in the setting up of the Law Enforcement Training Scheme (LETS). Responsibility-sharing, mutual trust and effective cooperation between all actors involved are the key to the success of the tools the EU has put in place in recent years. CEPOL\u2019s new mandate ensures that the agency supports and enforces the five key principles underpinning the European Agenda on Security: 1) Ensure full compliance with fundamental rights; 2) Increase transparency, accountability and democratic control to give citizens confidence; 3) Ensure better application and implementation of existing EU legal instruments; 4) Foster a more joined-up inter-agency and a cross-sectorial approach; 5) Bring together all internal and external dimension of security.", "url": "https://cepol.europa.eu/media/news/cepol-becomes-european-union-agency-law-enforcement-training"}, {"id": "CEPOL_NEWS_0343", "date": "2016-05-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Call for papers for the 2016 CEPOL Research and Science Conference now open", "text": "CEPOL and the National University of Public Service are inviting papers for the 2016 CEPOL European Police Research and Science Conference.

The objective of the meeting was to strengthen cooperation between CEPOL and the law enforcement academy of the Georgian Ministry of Interior. The recent developments with regards to security issues put emphasis on the need for a globalised law enforcement cooperation. This meeting is a step forward to enforce closer cooperation with the countries from the Eastern Partnership area in the field of training. CEPOL is happy to see progress with the operationalisation of working agreements with Georgia and to count an increasing number of Georgian participants to its activities, notably to residential activities and to the European Police Exchange Programme. After presenting its portfolio, CEPOL encouraged Georgia to take a more active part in its online activities, but also to nominate experts to be added to its Lecturers, Trainers and Researchers database (LTRdb). Mr. Giorgi Mghebrishvili, the Georgian Ministry of Interior, also stressed the will of Georgia to enhance cooperation with CEPOL. He explained that the top priority for Georgia is to develop the capacity of the Ministry of Interior police academy with the help of CEPOL. The objective is to increase the standards of police education in the country and put in place more sophisticated methods. He believes reforms cannot be sustainable without proper education. Georgia wants to become a regional hub for police education and training to allow for networking and better cooperation between law enforcement authorities in the region. Georgia would welcome CEPOL\u2019s help and advice to create such a hub. Dr. Ferenc B\u00e1nfi, Director of CEPOL, commented: \u201cCEPOL was very honoured to receive the visit of the delegation of the Georgian Ministry of Interior.

The Agency\u2019s Governing Board gathered last week in Scheveningen, near The Hague (the Netherlands), for its biannual meeting. The main topic was the implementation of the new CEPOL regulation (which will enter into force on 1 July) and its consequences for the Agency and EU Member States. Frederike Everts, member of the Executive Board of the Dutch Police Academy, chaired the meeting. Directors of police and/or police academies from all EU Member States, as well as delegations from the European Commission, AEPC and EUROPOL, took part on it. Safer Europe Jannine van den Berg, Chief Constable of the Central Division of the National Police of the Netherlands, opened the meeting as portfolio holder on international police cooperation:\u201cWe are currently facing many serious challenges within the European Union. The growing numbers of migrants who flew their homes, hoping for a better life in the European Union, show us the privilege to live in this part of the world and the importance to cherish our values of freedom, security and justice. Other events, such as the recent terrorist attacks in Brussels and Paris show us however that these values should not be taken for granted, and emphasise the need for enhanced cooperation between Member States to realise a safe and secure European Union.\u201d She continued: \"In order to enhance safety within the EU, law enforcement authorities in the Member States must be well trained and informed of the key issues at stake.

CEPOL is an EU agency that provides training and learning opportunities to law enforcement officers on issues vital to the security of the European Union and its citizens. Every year CEPOL organises at least 100 courses, seminars and conferences. Activities are organised in the Member States by national police academies and in the Agency\u2019s headquarters (Budapest, Hungary). In 2015, more than 3000 law enforcement officers participated in these activities. In addition, CEPOL offers an exchange programme, online modules, webinars and common curricula. New tasks The new CEPOL regulation presents some relevant changes for the Agency, such as: A wider target group: CEPOL will not only or primarily offer training activities for police officers, but for all law enforcement organisations at all levels. CEPOL will also play a key role in organising joint training on missions in the framework of the EU Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP).

Discussions at this joint meeting centered on the question of how cooperation and coordination at a national level between the National Units at Europol and the National Contact Points of CEPOL can be enhanced. The joint meeting was a special occasion for both directors, Mr. Wainwright of Europol and Dr. B\u00e1nfi of CEPOL: \u201cWe bring two communities together and work side by side in helping the Member States fighting crime and terrorism for a safer Europe\" said Dr. B\u00e1nfi. European Police College CEPOL stands for \u201cColl\u00e8ge Europ\u00e9en de Police\u201d, the European Police College. CEPOL is an EU agency that provides training and learning opportunities to law enforcement officers on issues vital to the security of the European Union and its citizens. Training covers topics ranging from leadership to law enforcement techniques and from EU cooperation to counter terrorism and migration issues. Activities are designed to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and best practices and to contribute to the development of a common European law enforcement culture. European Law Enforcement Agency Europol is the European Union\u2019s law enforcement agency whose main goal is to help achieve a safer Europe for the benefit of all EU citizens. It is the intelligence organisation within the EU. Europol assists the European Union\u2019s Member States in their fight against serious international crime and terrorism. For this, Europol provides information exchange between the police authorities of the EU Member States. National Contact Points \u2013 National Units The National Contact Points (NCPs) are the points of contact for CEPOL in each EU Member State, but also in associated countries. NCPs are critical to CEPOL success, in terms of implementing training activities and in facilitating the participation of law enforcement officers in the training activities. Regarding Europol, each of the 28 EU Member States has set up a Europol National Unit (ENU) in their respective countries. The other non-EU partners countries such as Australia, Canada, the USA and Norway, have created a Europol National Contact Point (Europol NCP). Cooperation in training and sharing knowledge A number of training courses offered by CEPOL are carried out jointly by Europol and CEPOL. By sharing training and knowledge at international level, the quality of law enforcement investigations can be improved. This joint meeting opens a new chapter in cooperation and better understanding by sharing thoughts and views. During the meeting the participants spoke about enhance alignment between national units. In workshops they shared their experiences and best practices. By example how training can support the operational field of Europol and how to communicate training needs to CEPOL. Both organisations gained a lot to build upon. The cooperation is valuable and worthwhile to continue the dialog. The Netherlands and the EU Presidency During this first half of 2016, the Netherlands holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union. This means that the Netherlands holds the presidency of the CEPOL Governing Board and Europol\u2019s Management Board.

The content The two first training courses - 89 and 90/2015 - gathered high profile officials and experts from the many law enforcement agencies confronted with the phenomenon of immigration. During the working sessions, the contributors scanned all strategic aspects of policing in the context of migration flows, including public order, criminal investigations and community policing, covering a wide range of topics such as migration routes, EU strategies in source, transit and destination countries, the impact of migration on public security and community cohesion etc. The two last activities - 91 and 92/2015 - targeted investigators and experts involved in criminal matters linked to migration. One put the focus on the Mediterranean area, while the sister course covered the Western Balkans region. The main goal was to prepare law enforcement officials to perform cross-border investigations in compliance with the recommendations of the EU action plan on migrant smuggling. They were \u201clearning-by-doing\u201d activities: the participants had to perform a virtual cross-border investigation on migrant smuggling across the 3-days training. The scenario offered opportunities to carry out proactive criminal and financial investigations, using the resources of EU agencies, the JITs instrument, SIS II and Interpol tools. The outcomes All participants in the four courses were also invited to reflect on the implementation of current EU decisions related to migration. The opinions from these 145 law enforcement officials will be aggregated to form a final \"opinion paper\" which will be conveyed by CEPOL to its stakeholders, the European Commission and the COSI (Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security). Last but not least, the 45 experts contributing to the residential training recorded short summaries of their contributions in studio. These recordings will form the basis of a comprehensive online module on migration. Statements from participants CEPOL implemented this ambitious training programme on migration in order to meet the urgent needs of the law enforcement community. The steady commitment of all players involved, and particularly of partner agencies like Europol and Frontex, under the careful supervision of the European Commission, made this training programme a success, as it was witnessed by many participants: \"As usual CEPOL courses are very well organised, have a very high professional level and are a nice experience!!!\" - participant from course 89/2015. \"The pre-course materials were very useful to me, and helped me to understand the aim of the course. We could learn how to cooperate on an international level - both at EU level and with the third countries\" - participant from course 90/2015. \"All topics addressed were very appropriate for learning: case scenarios, creating powerpoints and giving presentations made the strongest part of the course. I reckon these are really useful for everybody. Besides, these courses are the best opportunities to get to know each other!\" - participant from course 91/2015. \"There was a good balance between the presentations and the workshops. It was nice to work in small groups to get to know each other. I learned a lot and it was interesting to network with other colleagues about their experiences in their countries, especially concerning Albania and Turkey\" - participant from course 92/2015.", "url": "https://cepol.europa.eu/media/news/cepol-training-programme-migration-success-story"}, {"id": "CEPOL_NEWS_0348", "date": "2016-03-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "CEPOL condemns the heinous terrorist attacks in Brussels", "text": "CEPOL strongly condemns the horrifying terrorist attacks that have taken place in Brussels.

Gabor E., Hungary, trainer: \u201cSome knowledge of technical details about the whole Schengen Information System (SIS) could be useful in the SIRENE work. It is especially necessary in the preparation for the SCHEVAL process, while it teaches and prepares at the same time the police end-users to apply correctly the SIS legal base. The SIS itself is a very useful technical tool in this context\u201d. Judith D., Hungary, participant: \u201cI found the CEPOL\u2019s SIRENE train the trainers course very well organised. The course environment was very nice and comfortable. The trainers were excellent, well prepared. The content of the course and of the lectures will be useful for my daily job\u201d. Sarely V., Estonia, participant: \u201cMany significant questions were raised to which both trainers and trainees provided answers. Participants expected to acquire more knowledge about learning methods and to gain a better understanding of how they could use these methods effectively in their daily job. I believe that these expectations were met through the theoretical lectures and hands-on exercises carried out during the training\u201d.", "url": "https://cepol.europa.eu/media/news/cepol-training-activity-432015-sirene-train-trainers"}, {"id": "CEPOL_NEWS_0358", "date": "2015-10-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "13th CEPOL National Contact Points meeting", "text": "CEPOL\u2019s Headquarters hosted from 6 to 8 October the 13th National Contact Points meeting.

It brought together experts in intelligence analysis from all over Europe to exchange good practices and execute practical exercises. The Operational Intelligence Analysis Training 2015 (OIAT 2015) course focused on the foundations of criminal intelligence analysis, such as information sources, evaluation, collation, data interpretation and argumentation. The objective of the course was to bring together participants from different European countries to facilitate the collation and sharing of best practices among analysts. It also aimed at creating a network of analysts to enforce international cooperation. CEPOL, assisted by EUROPOL, brought together five international experts in Intelligence Analysis, to provide training in Operational Intelligence Analysis, in CEPOL Headquarters in Budapest. The objective of running this training course was to enhance understanding of the Analysis Intelligence Cycle. It is important that we begin to standardise the approach to analysis across member countries and establish a consistent methodology to applying analytical and data integration techniques. By the final day of the course, participants were able to describe the purpose of intelligence analysis in three different policing contexts, to outline the concept of intelligence and explain a minimum of four steps in the six-step intelligence cycle, to explain the main principles of a collection plan for an analytical assignment, to define a minimum of six different sources of information in criminal intelligence, and to assess the information and the source in terms of its intelligence value by using the standard 4 x 4 evaluation model. On top of this, participants learned how to apply critical thinking in hypotheses development, when constructing conclusions and intelligence requirements, how to use a minimum of four different analytical techniques when conducting intelligence analysis and how to deliver analytical findings through a standardised oral reporting format. Through training, the OIAT 2015 helped to take a step towards a more unified European Standards on analysis and to move the profession of intelligence analyst further in the European Policing context. A glimpse on participants\u2019 feeling: Elaine D., Ireland: \u201cThe course was wonderful.\u201d Paulo D., Portugal: \u201cThe most important thing I learned was the collection plan.

The CEPOL Leadership Workshop for Police Chiefs was a 2 days conference, the first of its kind. It brought together the highest ranking Police Chiefs from all EU Member States to exchange good practices on leadership. The conference aims at becoming a forum for debate and dialogue amongst EU law enforcement leadership. Experts from the European Commission, EUROPOL, FRONTEX, the OSCE, INTERPOL, the University of Leeds and Dacia/Renault Group Romania animated workshops on the European Agenda on Security and on contemporary policing themes, examined from inside and outside perspective. Ms. Cecilia Verkleij, Head of Sector at DG HOME, was representing the European Commission. Her presentation focused on the European Agenda on Security and on the renewed EU Internal Security Strategy 2015-2020. She presented the three key priorities in internal security (counter-terrorism, serious and organised crime and cybercrime), explaining that the EU decided to focus its strategy on these priorities due to their cross-border nature. Recent events have shown that an effective response to the security threats emerging from this instability requires a coordinated action of Member States and EU Agencies, as only such actions can make a real difference. Ms. Verkleij also emphasised that the police plays a major role in guaranteeing the security of EU citizens and quoted the results from the latest Eurobarometer saying that EU citizens feel secure thanks to the police work. She concluded by highlighting that CEPOL is leading a program to train leaders to solve the assymetry problem in security policies at EU level. Mr. Wil Van Gemert, Deputy Director Operations, was representing EUROPOL. His presentation focused on the trends in serious and organised crime. Serious and organised crime is an increasingly dynamic and complex problem. While the key dimensions of some criminal threats remain broadly unchanged and traditional criminal markets such as drugs trafficking and organised property crime continue to be a large part of the overall organised criminal landscape, the routes, modi operandi and increasingly the technologies exploited by criminals continue to diversify and evolve. There is a shift of criminality towards online activities. There is a completely new form of the use of social media for criminal purpose. Social media make it easier for organised crime groups to reach out and agree on how to proceed. Digital technologies are also favorising an increase in polycrime groups. Criminal actors, both groups and individual criminal entrepreneurs, increasingly adopt the crime-as-a-service business model, which is facilitated by social networking online. In the pursuit of new clients, organised crime invariably seeks to change the commodities they trade shifting from traditional goods to new commodities. To conclude, Mr. Van Gemert raised several key questions for the future of EU internal security that served as basis for discussion among EU police chiefs. Ms. B\u00e9atrice Comby, Director of Capacity Building Division, was representing FRONTEX. She explained that Europe is facing the biggest migration crisis since the end of World War 2, with more than 500.000 detected irregular migrants at its external borders by the end of August as a consequence. Tens of thousands of people seeking security and shelter within the EU and risk their health and lives to reach the safe haven, our countries. For the EU Border Management Agency FRONTEX this migratory pressure at the EU external borders, at such level unpredicted, has become an issue of greatest concern. Due to the increase of migration flow, border guards have on average 12s to decide if a person documents are falsified. This workflow constitutes an ominous threat for the management of EU borders. The challenges at EU external borders assume 3 main forms: 1) Mixed migratory flows, 2) Cross-border crime and terrorist threat, 3) Mobility and budgetary constraints. These challenges require intensified cooperation on national as well as international level within the law enforcement family, the civil society as much as with the business and industry sectors. Ms. Comby concluded that only a broader perspective of border management as instrument to the EU internal security and international security will allow efficiently fighting against organised and crossing border crime, terrorism, smuggling of people and trafficking of human beings. The OSCE presentation focused on terrorism, radicalisation and financing related to terrorism. After a brief introduction on the terrorism evolution, the focus was put on the radicalisation processes of individuals. Community policing reveals to be a very effective tool to prevent violent extremism. However, there are serious gaps in prevention and law enforcement shares the responsibility for this with others. There is a need to involve civil society (parents, young people) and other State institutions (ministries of education, culture, etc.) to tackle the issue together. He concluded by emphasising that preventing terrorism is a task for all layers of society. Professor David S. Wall, Professor of Criminology, was representing the University of Leeds. His presentation explored how technology is changing the cyber-threat landscape and impacting upon the police services in terms of overall crime workloads. It also briefly outlined technological impacts upon public service delivery and its own organisation. Prof. Wall warned about mesh technologies and how they reduce the ability to govern the Internet. He also pointed out the issues linked to self-deleting communications, such as Snapchat, that reduce the intelligence gathering potential. Discussions evolved around which kind of cybercrimes are affecting the police today before moving on how technological developments shall impact on the police over the next 5-10 years. Prof. Wall concluded that with the fast-paced nature of cybercrime, training becomes crucial for law enforcement officers to tackle evolving threats. Mr. Glyn Lewis, Executive Director for Strategy and Governance, was representing INTERPOL. His presentation set the scene in regards to some major challenges confronting police globally and the impact it is having on police leadership and decision making. Mr. Lewis then presented how INTERPOL is responding to this environment and how it is being reconfigured to respond more flexibly to meet these challenges and the needs of police in its 190 member countries. Mr. Lewis emphasised the challenges linked to different leadership cultures and styles. He examined how to deal with these various approaches. He concluded that the only way to coordinate between these different leadership styles is to create a platform where leaders can meet and debate. This would allow for better coordination and information sharing at the highest level. Mr. Mihai Acsinte, Chief Legal and Ethics Officer at Renault Group Romania, was representing the view of the private sector. He presented the business model of Dacia/Renault and provided with food for thought on how to apply such a model to the public sector. He examined scenarii on how to perform more with less resources. Concepts like \u201cDo more with less\u201d or \u201cLow cost\u201d have been dissected and analysed for years in order to be applied in real life. Sometimes it worked and Dacia is the relevant example. Lessons learned from Dacia\u2019s success and parallels in terms of vision, strategy, and day to day management were analysed for use in law enforcement leadership. His presentation closed the workshops of the first EU Law Enforcement Leadership Workshop for Police Chiefs. What can be learned from these debates and discussions? Preventing crime is a very difficult task. The dynamic nature of crime forces EU law enforcement to adapt in order to respond to evolving threats. But, what are the \"must-haves\u201d for policing in the EU? Where to put the resources for maximum outcome? These questions remain open. A way forward shall be to move from cooperative models to co-production and co-creation. The EU should moreover device more systems and standards to understand crime and share information about it. Finally, globalisation is getting more important to the domestic agenda as crime knows no borders. It is crucial to bring international affairs at the front of national agendas to tackle this threat efficiently. Part of the solution has to come from outside policing: we need to integrate the best ideas that would come from private/public partnership. This workshop offered a platform bringing together practitioners and academics to reflect on EU security issues at the highest level. The first EU Law Enforcement Leadership Workshop for Police Chiefs is part of CEPOL\u2019s comprehensive Leadership Programme. In addition to the conference, CEPOL\u2019s Leadership Programme consists of a training for Future Leaders (divided in two modules taking place in October and November 2015), of a training for Heads of Training Institutions (one module in 2016) and of the European Joint Master Programme, the first EU academic programme focused on policing.", "url": "https://cepol.europa.eu/media/news/addressing-eu-security-issues-highest-level"}, {"id": "CEPOL_NEWS_0362", "date": "2015-09-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Delegation from ENTRi partnership visits CEPOL", "text": "Today, CEPOL welcomes a delegation from ENTRi (Europe\u2019s New Training Initiative for Civilian Crisis Management), a partnership of organisations from EU Member States and Switzerland that provides training for officers deployed at crisis management missions.

The purpose of this meeting was to develop further cooperation in cross cutting issues such as counter terrorism, illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings. Following the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Copenhagen, cooperation between Member States in the control of their external borders has become more necessary than ever. Common trainings for border guards are seen as crucial to enhance the effectiveness of the fight against crime and to ensure the security of the European Union and its citizens. In this regard, CEPOL and Frontex representatives met to discuss further ways of cooperation in training senior law enforcement officers to tackle criminal threats such as terrorism, organised crime, drug trafficking, illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings. \u201cThere is an obvious necessity for EU agencies to cooperate in the most efficient and coherent way possible; the more we communicate and understand each other\u2019s priorities and needs, the better will we be able to perform and accomplish our missions and duties\u201d, Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri said. During the visit Mr. Leggeri met with Dr Ferenc B\u00e1nfi, CEPOL Director, Ms Aija Kalnaja, Head of Training and Dr Stefano Failla, Head of Strategic Affairs. Dr. B\u00e1nfi commented: \u201cIf we want to protect our citizens we must ensure that training law enforcement officers on border control issues is properly carried out, while granting fundamental rights at the same time. CEPOL and Frontex have organised joint training activities since both agencies signed an agreement in 2009.

Hosted by the European Police College (CEPOL) in Budapest from 7 to 10 April, a training course will allow over 40 participants representing law enforcement, the private sector and NGO Hotlines from the INHOPE Network to acquire the technical, operational and procedural competences to detect and prevent the production and dissemination of commercial child sexual abuse material online. The training takes place in the context of the European Financial Coalition against the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Online (EFC), a project chaired by Europol\u2019s Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and coordinated by Missing Children Europe, and it will be led by CEPOL, EC3 and MasterCard. Through a combination of presentations on various methods of investigation and practical workshops participants will become acquainted with relevant Internet investigation techniques, act against the use of legitimate payment systems to trade child sexual abuse material and gain knowledge on how to follow and manage criminal compliance procedures. Particular focus will also be placed on how to establish and strengthen public-private partnerships in enhancing the sharing of knowledge and sharpening of (tracing) skills in preventing the misuse of financial services for commercial sexual exploitation of children. Olivier Burgersdijk EFC-Chairman and Head of Strategy of EC3 said: \"Having practitioners from various relevant partners attending the EFC training will hopefully improve the prevention of and protection against the abuse of payment systems for the commercial sexual exploitation of children. In particular, the combination of participants from different sectors, including law enforcement and financial services, is expected to contribute to a better mutual understanding of how their roles complement each other. As such, it can stimulate successful multi-disciplinary cooperation and lead to even better results.\u201d In February, the EFC published a strategic assessment of commercial sexual exploitation of children online which found that criminals that sexually exploit children online are becoming more entrepreneurial with technological developments and are continuing to find ways to increase their profits. Live streaming of sexual abuse for payment is no longer an emerging trend but an established reality. It is of particular concern in the context of emerging markets due to increased Internet adoption there. Against this background, Dr. Ferenc B\u00e1nfi, Director of CEPOL, stated: \u201cIt\u2019s time that we stop treating commercial sexual exploitation of children as a side issue. CEPOL is at the forefront of the European Union\u2019s response to this threat by providing law enforcement officers with specific training in this area, including several residential activities and webinars scheduled in 2015, and is also an active member of the EFC.

Ebola virus outbreak 2014 was declared in Guinea and rapidly spread to other West-African countries. This crisis was handed over to the army and not to the medical sector, thus turning it into a security issue. Even though this presented the advantage of promoting the construction of hospitals in West-Africa, it also had problematic consequences. Travel bans had a devastating effect on West-African countries\u2019 economies, civil liberties and freedoms were restricted and the media contributed to create public fear and mass hysteria. This has had heavy consequences for law enforcement agencies, there but also in Europe. This CEPOL course gave an insight into these consequences.

The EJMP is a two years part time programme and comprises 60 ECTS. It is the first EU academic programme aimed at addressing common challenges of police cooperation in the frame of internal security. The programme aims at providing science-based competences in the field of International and European Police and law enforcement cooperation and management. The EJMP provides added value to police training and police work in the European Union and contributes to a successful cooperation of law enforcement authorities in the Space of Freedom, Security and Justice. The programme is designed to further qualify law enforcement officers on the implementation and operationalisation of EU instruments, especially on police cooperation in concrete cross-border settings. The Master Programme consists of 7 modules. Each module draws a variety of assignments which are assessed on a Common Assessment Framework. The main characteristic of this framework is that it can evenly be used and applied by all assessors in all contributing institutions to the full echelon of assignments, whether they are written or oral in nature, small or large in size, empirical or theoretical. The framework is based on a common scheme that has successfully been applied by several universities. The CEPOL learning environment is part of the learning structure, with the inclusion of an e-learning environment (Webinars, Common Curricula and e-Learning Modules). The EJMP is dedicated to senior police officers or experts in general management positions or specialist positions who intend to gain or improve competences in the field of International and European Police and law enforcement cooperation and management.

Discrimination and gender-based violence continues around the world, in all societies and regions. Women are harassed, raped, mutilated, beaten or murdered, even in their own homes. According to a report by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), in the EU, one in three women has experienced physical and/or sexual violence since the age of 15. Combating all forms of gender-based violence and girls is a fundamental pillar of the respect for human or fundamental rights and remains a priority for the EU, both internally and externally. For this very reason, Dr. Ferenc B\u00e1nfi, Director of CEPOL, has joined the White Ribbon Campaign, an initiative promoted by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) and also the world\u2019s biggest campaign engaging men in fighting gender-based violence. Gender-based violence has always been acknowledged by CEPOL as very serious criminal phenomenon with devastating social impact. To help ending domestic and gender-based violence, the agency has developed a complementary portfolio of training and learning tools focusing on these issues. This multi-layered training package consists of residential activities (courses, seminars, conferences) that discuss characteristic examples of exploitation and oppression of women, of online seminars (webinar) on Trafficking in Human Beings (THB) and gender-based violence, of online module on gender-based violence and of a common curriculum on domestic violence. Besides, CEPOL collaborates with various human rights agencies and organisations (i.e. FRA, ILGA\u2026) to elaborate its activities and provides opportunities for their experts to address a wide law enforcement audience. See below for details on the different activities implemented by CEPOL since 2011 on these topics. As THB is one of the most serious crimes that violate human dignity and the fundamental rights of persons, CEPOL has treated the fight against this criminal phenomenon as its top priority since its foundation. CEPOL`s commitment to combat the distinctive example of criminal exploitation and oppression of women is reinforced by the fact that majority of the victims are often defenceless, having extremely vulnerable social status (children, women living in extreme poverty, migrants, refugees). Combatting domestic violence is featured in courses on community policing where \u2013 among other topics \u2013 CEPOL intends to facilitate the adoption of multidisciplinary and integrated approach by strengthening cooperation between police and non-law enforcement players. In 2015, CEPOL will continue its work to help fight gender-based violence. Several activities are in the pipeline: a course (3/2015 Trafficking in Human Beings - labour exploitation), two webinars (55/2014 Hate Crime Indicators: how to recognise Bias Motives in practice; 62/2014 Severe forms of labour exploitation) on THB, a course on community policing (68/2015 Community policing), two courses on the promotion of fundamental rights and related ethical standards in day to day police work (70/2015 Fundamental Rights and Police Ethics - Step 1; 71/2015 Management of diversity - Step 2). Besides, the module and common curriculum remain available. CEPOL activities on gender-based violence Since 2012, residential activities implemented entailed: 2/2014 THB mechanisms with specific focus on reduction of demand (13-15 May 2014, Sweden, 28 participants); 3/2014 EU approach to Trafficking in Human Beings (15-18 September 2014, Lithuania, 31 participants); 70/2014 Community policing (17-21 November 2014, France, 28 participants); 8/2013 EU approach to Trafficking in Human Beings (9-12 April 2013, Sweden, 31 Participants); 9/2013 THB - Prevention mechanisms with specific focus on reduction of demand (15-17 October 2013, Sweden, 27 Participants); 1/2012 Trafficking in Human Beings (10-13 April 2012, Hungary, 26 Participants); 26/2012 Community policing (5-9 November 2012, Finland, 27 participants); 66/2012 THB prevention programmes for target countries (19-22 November 2012, UK, 12 participants); and 67/2012 THB victim handling in line with human rights (16-19 October 2012, Spain, 26 participants).

Moreover, CEPOL has developed the \u201cGender-based violence\u201d online module in 2011 with cooperation of experts from Austria, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Spain. So far 198 Law Enforcement officers (47 in 2014) have completed this training package. Finally, CEPOL has developed a common curriculum on domestic violence in 2009 that has been updated in 2012. The curriculum has been distributed to all 28 Member States for integration into their national training programmes thus reaching nationwide police audiences. It contains recommendations for training on the following topics: Interpersonal violence (IPV) in old age and people with disabilities; Implementation of an integral information system in the EU area, similar to the Spanish VdG System, allowing monitoring of any type of case to protect victims; Adaptation of design and contents of e-learning module on gender violence for CEPOL and international seminars; Domestic violence amongst LGBT people (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender); Burnout syndrome among police officers; Violence in ethnic subcultures; New multi-professional strategies and tactics in the protection of victims and control of offenders; Overcoming attrition in domestic violence cases; and A Module Description with updating activity for the heads of special police teams dedicated only to tackling domestic violence situations (periodic training for specialists in prevention, investigation and/or protection of victims).

The delegation consists of Mr. Gatis \u0160vika, Head of the Bureau State Police of Latvia, Mrs. Dina Tarane, Deputy Director of the State Police College and Mrs. Inguna Trule, Senior Specialist. The purpose of this visit is to devise ways for closer cooperation on training between CEPOL and the presidency. The delegation will meet CEPOL staff and deliver a presentation on the priorities of the upcoming presidency. Mr. \u0160vika stated: \u201cThe presidency of the Council of the EU gives a country such an external visibility, insight to EU matters and also maturity. It really is an asset which could be easily used afterwards. People will remember you, because each presidency leaves its footprints and Latvia will also do so\u201d. Dr. Ferenc B\u00e1nfi, Director of the European Police College, stated: \u201cThis presidency will offer CEPOL a unique opportunity to deliver training in the areas of security and law enforcement in a dynamic and constantly changing environment. We will also work together in effectively strengthen the EU role as a global actor since this is one of the main priorities of the incoming presidency\u201d. The Latvian presidency of the Council of the European Union will take place from 1 January until 30 June 2015. CEPOL team of Latvia: \"For Latvia and Latvians our presidency in the Council of the European Union is a historical turning point and we shall give our utmost to reach established goals in an efficient way contributing to the security of the European Union. The implementation of the Strategic guidelines in the area of freedom, security and justice adopted by the European Council in June 2014 as well as the respective follow-up initiatives will form the core of Latvian presidency priorities. Reiterating the European Council\u2019s statement the main focus lies on the effective implementation of the existing legislation, policy initiatives and intensified practical cooperation at operational level. Latvia is prepared to work towards an effective response to the current security challenges in the EU, such as. Terrorism remains a major threat to the internal security. In close cooperation with the Member States and EU Counter terrorism coordinator particular focus will be given to the phenomenon of the foreign fighters. Latvia will build up on the conclusions reached by the Italian presidency. High on the incoming presidency\u2019s agenda are issues related to migratory pressure in the EU taking into account the current global situation. Latvia intends to continue the established comprehensive and structural approach established by the previous presidencies. While currently the focus remains largely on the Mediterranean region, Latvia will prioritise the situation at the Eastern borders. Processes there should be closely monitored and a rapid response by the EU should be ensured if needed. The presidency will invest significant efforts in policy developments, particularly the updating the Internal Security Strategy by mid-2015 as laid down by the Strategic Guidelines \u2013building on the work started by the European Commission and our Italian colleagues. On the open legislative proposals: Latvia aims at achieving an agreement on the revised Visa Code ; We will continue negotiations of the students/ researchers directive; Negotiations on the amendments in Dublin regulation concerning unaccompanied minors will be advanced; Work on the Smart borders package will be continued to reach as much progress as possible. A particular effort will be invested to advance the work on new legal basis both for Europol and CEPOL. Establishment of the European PNR will be high on the agenda. Latvian presidency aims at achieving significant progress in the area of new legislation on the control of new psychoactive substances. The new legal basis of CEPOL will shape the law enforcement training policy developments. The draft regulation will continue to be discussed in the Law Enforcement Working Party of the Council and it is hoped that a general approach can be reached during the Latvian Presidency. Besides the work on the new legal basis, CEPOL has successfully completed the relocation to Budapest with minor implications to the core business. Despite the discussions over the budget and challenges related to personnel, the relocation was organised and implemented smoothly in a record short time. It is a considerable achievement of all involved making this possible. Recent events around CEPOL prove an old saying \u201etogether we stand, divided we fall\u201d. Only working together and clearly understanding our mission we can move forward and develop the European law enforcement training system that serves the European Union society by creating a unified law enforcement culture and building trust among the officers. Law enforcement training is a corner stone of creating a comprehensive law enforcement culture and protecting the democratic values of the European Community. CEPOL\u2019s training that builds and furthers the knowledge of our officers serves as a solid basis for further improvement of our operational performance in tackling security related risks. Particular attention should be paid to the implementation of the various tasks defined in the European Law Enforcement Training Scheme. Four strands for the improvement of knowledge, skills and competence of our officers as established by LETS should be implemented in close cooperation between the CEPOL and the Member States. The personnel capacity of the CEPOL and its limited budget demands a serious attention in order to reach our goals. The system of selection of activities should be addressed in order to reach a balance between low budget and topicality of the proposed courses. Stronger emphasis should be paid to the topicality of the proposed course and the proposed course curriculum and programme. During the Latvian presidency within the Law enforcement working party we plan to initiate discussion among the Member States about the necessity to intensify the work of CEPOL in the field of training activities on forensics. The increasing demand for cooperation among the forensics services of the Member States calls for improved and coordinated training in this particular field of law enforcement. The exchange programme has proven to be a success story and should be continued. The programme should be target oriented towards the practical needs of law enforcement. The task of the national agencies should continue to be dissemination of the gained experience and utilising it in the field of cross border cooperation. The proposed new scope for the CEPOL\u2019s training target group will raise new challenges not only for the national contact points but for the CEPOL itself. The involvement of other law enforcement agencies in the training process demands clear vision on the priority fields while keeping the emphasis to the actual cross border policing priorities. The respective work of the National Contact Points also has to be reorganised in relation to this development. Latvian presidency is keen to continue the efforts in enlargement of the external relations of the CEPOL network, especially taking into account the urgent need to share the values of democratic and human rights based policing among our partners outside the EU. Therefore the CEPOL Latvian presidency conference that is dedicated to the fight against cybercrime will involve our colleagues from the Eastern Partnership countries and candidate countries. CEPOL\u2019s research and science mandate should be properly assessed and discussed among the Member States in order to have a clear perspective of this field of activity. The existing CEPOL\u2019s e learning tools such as online learning modules, electronic journals, trainers data base and webinars are well organised but should be more advertised among the law enforcement communities of the Member States in order to raise awareness of these learning opportunities and to encourage the serving officers to participate in these activities. This should be closely linked to the ongoing work to improve professional command of foreign languages among the law enforcement officers. The national training institutions together with CEPOL should pay an adequate attention to this issue as it is affecting personnel\u2019s opportunities to participate in the EU training process and contribute to practical cross border cooperation. During the Latvian presidency we plan to organise the following events in Latvia: CEPOL presidency conference on the topic \u201eCybercrime strategic\u201d on 25-27 March, CEPOL Governing Board on 19-20 May. Besides the National contact point meeting will take place in Budapest on 14-16 April. CEPOL is not only coordinating the training for our officers. CEPOL is serving as a centre of excellence for training, research and cooperation purposes. The success of any cross border police operation is dependent to the mutual trust among the officers and their awareness about the cross border cooperation mechanisms. CEPOL is the central institution that brings together the training needs and coordinates the training activities for all the EU Member States. Our task is to concentrate our efforts and to maximize the contribution that Member States and CEPOL agency can deliver for our officers and for our communities. And in this work we completely count on the support and cooperation from all of you to make our training system better\".

The whole course was concluded with presentations on cooperation between the police and private sector during the safeguarding security during sport events and the role of Europol during the major events. The activity was highly appreciated by the participants. Key factor of the success of the course was that the participants already knew each other form Step 1 and they had an opportunity to continue discussions and sharing of experience. Step 3 would be highly appreciated by all. Generally, very welcomed by the participants was the group work and participation at the practical exercise. \u201cAll the different topics were found beneficial for my professional career, especially the workgroup sessions where the organization and handling of a demonstration was prepared and afterwards exposed and analyzed to the whole group.\u201d It was also stated by the participants: \u201cI believe that (knowledge gained) would be ideal for updates in the legislation of each country regarding the matter and most important to standardize operations for better joint operations. \u201c Some participants welcomed that they \u201cgot a lot of important information which (they will) try to adapt to (their) work. \u201c Attendees also appreciated that: \u201cVery valuable was to meet different colleagues from different countries who work at this field and it was good to share their experiences.

The general aim of the conference was to collect and present current results of police theory and research and to as-sess the impact on policing strategies.130 participants from 28 Member States, Canada and Hong Kong took part in the conference and listened to different lectures of 33 speakers.Keynote speakers, members of panels, and participants from the European and international police science and research community discussed the impact of the Euro crisis and austerity policies on societies, the rela-tionship between police and citizens and on policing. Massive increase of migration from poor and crisis or war stricken regions of the world but also an increase of protest demonstrations and riots caused by the financial and economic crisis in European member states, particularly in Europes\u2019 South, have significant consequences for police tasks and policing strategies.Apart from that police is systematically confronted with challenges that are inherent to its function and role in society and especially linked with its right to use force. So the conference programme also focused on questions of legality, legitimacy and accountability of the police and especially on policing ethnic minorities. In addition new challenges such as new digital /social media and their impact on police during routine oper-ations, on crime control activities and major events were topics of the conference.The conference addressed a big variety of specific themes related to police and policing in a comparative international perspective, by this presenting an overview on newest results of police science, police re-search projects and innovative policing approaches.The keynote speakers discussed issues regarding current developments in police science and checks and balances on policing: The constabulary ethic and police science; some reflections on the ethical dimensions the \u2018gold standard\u2019 in police research (James Sheptycki) Citizens\u2018 rights and policing: Evidence from FRA research (Joanna Goodey) During the three days of presentations and discussion it became more and more evident that the underly-ing key question of the whole conference was: What makes a professional, what makes a good police in a democratic society and how can police research and science contribute to that objective? Following James Sheptycky \u201cpolicing is the practical policy of social ordering\u201d. Sophisticated strategies based on empirical evidence will help to implement good policing but as much can be achieved by police officers who just feel and behave as \u201ccitizens in uniform\u201d whose first simple question is \u201chow can I help?\u201dThe conference was organised by Germany (German Police University) in cooperation with France and Slovenia.

These were the prefatory remarks of the address given by Italian Interior Minister Annamaria Cancellieri at the opening ceremony of the Academic Year 2011-12 at the Scuola di perfezionamento per le Forze di Polizia (SFP), the Italian Interagency Law-Enforcement College of Advanced Studies. The Minister\u2019s address followed the opening remarks given by the Director of the SFP, Carabinieri General Vincenzo Giuliani. Also present at the ceremony were Mr Carlo De Stefano, under-secretary at the Ministry of the Interior, Mr Giuseppe Procaccini, chief of staff to the Interior Minister and Mr Antonio Manganelli, Italy\u2019s Chief of Police. Guest speakers included prof. Giorgio Spangher, professor at the \u2018La Sapienza\u2019 University in Rome as well as a non-judge member of the Consiglio superiore della magistratura, Italy\u2019s judiciary self-governance body. \u201cThe expertise of each law-enforcement officer\u201d, the minister told the SFP\u2019s Advanced Training Course attendees, \u201crepresents a huge investment for the whole country, which entrusts you with carrying out a project aimed at ensuring security, legality and welfare for the entire community\u201d. According to Ms Cancellieri, sharing experience and expertise at an operational level and, better still, during training, is necessary to respond to \u201cthe new challenges posed by modernisation, innovation and unfamiliar situations arising worldwide\u201d. There is also a need for \u201cgreater unity among police forces as a whole\u201d, said the minister, \u201cin order to better serve the country, as it goes through a delicate phase when security and social cohesion emerge as major issues against a backdrop of social uncertainty\u201d. The minister also stressed \u201cthe growing transnational dimension of crime, mafia groups and illegal immigration rings\u201d. The threat posed by organised criminals knows no border. Hence it requires, she said, \u201can international response based on a cohesive approach\u201d both domestically and among police forces from different countries. \u201cItaly\u2019s security apparatus is a paradigm of excellence in the international arena\u201d, said Ms Cancellieri, \u201cas witnessed by the fact that the expertise of our officers is made available to other countries by sharing our training schemes and through direct training provision on specific issues, for which unanimous acknowledgement and recognition is received\u201d. \u201cThe quality of our response, in terms of effective security policies\u201d, she continued, \u201cis bound to significantly affect the public perception of safety. It will also be a measure of our Government\u2019s ability to accomplish its mission, at different institutional levels. This is why\u201d, she added, \u201cwe must all strive to put in place a security apparatus that helps generate cohesion. Without solidarity and social cohesion, no liberty is safe\u201d. Therefore, she concluded, \u201cthe value of safety and security, to which each and every member of the public is entitled, must be acknowledged and preserved\u201d, so as to lay the ground for the citizens to \u201ceffectively exercise\u201d their rights.

There will also be group study visits to the European Union agencies that deal with justice and home affairs, including Europol and Frontex. Exchanges are organised according to 16 topics, which have been identified as important to the safety and security of European citizens. In 2012, four new topics will be included: illegal immigration, container shipments, mobile organised crime groups and the network for fugitive active search teams. A group exchange will be organised on the topic of trafficking in human beings. Exchanges are open to participants who have a minimum of three years\u2019 work experience in the field of interest and must speak at least one foreign language. Further, participants must commit to cascading their newly gained knowledge to colleagues at a national and European level. Police officers interested in taking part in the 2012 Exchange Programme are advised to read the participants handbook and contact their national exchange coordinator (details included in the handbook). The Exchange Programme, now in its seventh year has been steadily growing in popularity and in 2011, almost 300 people, from 26 EU countries took part in the exchange programme \u2013 the highest number of participants ever in a single year and a significant increase from 2010.

The intention of the Danish Presidency is to focus the work of the Governing Board on the implementation of current decisions and projects under development.

The focus of the Governing Board will be on the implementation of the rationalisation process of CEPOL activities initiated during the Hungarian Presidency and continued during the Polish Presidency resulting in the adoption by the Governing Board of two important Decisions on the governance of CEPOL. During the Danish Presidency the Governing Board will monitor closely the implementation of these decisions resulting in a draft Governing Board Decision on working groups to be adopted by the Governing Board at the meeting in May 2012. Another important focus will be on the further maturing of the CEPOL Information Management Strategy and the Communication and ICT Strategies currently under development by the Secretariat in cooperation with Member States and to identify the Board Agenda in the context of \u201cInformation as a strategic asset to our organisation\u201d.

This is the highest number of participants ever in a single year and a significant increase from 2010, when only 80 people took part. The increase can be attributed to the wider range of exchange topics on offer this year and the introduction of group study visits. The CEPOL European Police Exchange Programme offers police officers, experts and police trainers the opportunity to spend up to 12 days with a partner organisation in another country. As with traditional exchanges, the visit is then reciprocated. Exchanges are organised according to areas of interest and take the form of an individual exchange, including a special programme for commanders, a group exchange with a specific focus (cybercrime in 2011) or a study visit. In 2011: 292 people took part from 26 EU countries Over 15 different topics were covered, including community policing and prevention of radicalisation, financial crime, trafficking in human beings and drug trafficking Three study visits to Europol and one study visit to OLAF As in previous years, the programme will be formally evaluated. This year\u2019s evaluation meeting takes place in Prague on 6 \u2013 7 December and is co-organised by the CEPOL and the Czech CEPOL team from the Czech Ministry of Interior. The purpose of the meeting is to review and assess the success of programme and agree recommendations for 2012 exchange programme. The two-day meeting will be attended by around 70 people, including representatives from the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Union agencies operating in the field of Justice and Home Affairs. Exchange programme coordinators from each Member State will also attend; as will over 50 exchange programme participants provide accounts of their individual exchanges on the first day of the meeting. Feedback indicates that most have had positive experiences, with over 95% of participants rating their exchange as either excellent or good. CEPOL Deputy Director Detlef Schr\u00f6der said: \u201cThe number of exchange participants that we have seen this year underlines the importance of the programme both in sharing law enforcement knowledge and skills and in fostering a European police culture. The exchange programme enables a better understanding of the issues facing Member States, a better knowledge of the solutions available and a better professional network, which combined make for a stronger response in the fight against crime. At a time when four out of ten EU citizens think that the EU needs better tools to fight crime, the exchange programme is more relevant than ever.\u201d A report on the 2011 exchange programme will soon be made available on the CEPOL website. About the 2011 European Police Exchange Programme The European Police Exchange Programme is one of CEPOL\u2019s pillar activities, offering police officers, experts and police trainers the opportunity to spend up to two weeks with a police force in another country. Built on the principles of traditional programmes, where visits are reciprocated, the exchange programme has been designed to: Promote mobility and the exchange of police officials, in the context of practical training programmes Establish a common and shared practical knowledge in different police fields; Facilitate sharing, at an EU level, police good practices Contribute to the creation of the European police identity Encourage mutual learning and networking within the framework of European police cooperation Each exchange is organised according to a participant\u2019s area of interest. In 2011, the exchange programme covered topics from community policing to counterterrorism, from forensics to financial crime and from dog handling to drug trafficking. In addition to traditional exchanges, The exchange programme also includes group study visits to EU agencies involved in justice and law enforcement, such as Europol and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).

The GB shall draw up the rules governing the creation and functioning of the working groups.\u201d Therefore the need for \u201cpermanent\u201d working groups is being questioned and the current structure of the WGL will be re-considered for the future. It is obvious however that the experts of the group will continue to work and contribute to the improvement of the core tasks of CEPOL, i.e. \u201clearning opportunities\u201d. During the 23rd meeting, the following issues were debated: 1 \u2013 Rationalisation of CEPOL Working groups contrary to committees may be created in accordance with the 2005 Council Decision, \u201cin case of strict necessity\u201d. The question of the most efficient structure having a realistic remit, with achievable and evaluable deliverables is looked at. The Chair of the WGL met the Chair of the project group on rationalisation at CEPOL last week. 2 \u2013 Survey on learning methods outcome The WGL was tasked by the TRC to carry out an evaluation of the use of learning methods for CEPOL courses. A subgroup of three experts in the group proceeded with the following approach: 98 \u201clearning opportunities\u201d were looked at by the subgroup. Out of these 98, 47 were analysed. 9 learning methods were identified: lectures by experts, presentations by participants, group work/workshop, plenary discussion, individual work, study visit , demonstrations (of case studies or technical ones), panel discussions, exercises (ex: TOPSPOC). The subgroup and the WGL recommend this document be forwarded to TRC. 3 \u2013 Role of the WGL with regards to common curricula: During the last TRC meeting, the WGL was asked to improve the common curricula description. It was suggested to select one or two of them, namely THB and Money Laundering, and assess the descriptions. The WGL\u2019s recommendation is: To update the common curricula to find a better match with educational standards and levels To set up a long term implementation plan for CC used in national curricula in order to achieve core standards of the Bologna Process 4 \u2013 Bologna process review For the past few years CEPOL has completed many surveys (SEPEB) and conducted seminars and conferences that were Bologna related. There are many concrete actions like common curricula and the Erasmus style mobility programme which are in line with Bologna principles. However, a comprehensive approach on how to realise the maximum potential of a harmonised police education area in Europe is still missing. This could be done with the support of Bologna process reforms in line with security programmes like the Stockholm Programme and the European Police Training Scheme as well as the OCTA and SOCTA reports. The aim of this review is not only to raise awareness but also to bring forward concrete strategic proposals on how to reach a Harmonised European Police Education area with the support of CEPOL\u2019s network. A draft proposal is therefore forwarded to the TRC. 5 \u2013 Survey on the use of the LMS and highlight report on LMS and e-Learning The group stressed the following findings: the survey focuses on the changes and 57 courses used LMS to support training. The WGL took note of the result and comments as follows: The report reveals that informal learning continues even during the months where there are no courses. Cascading of this kind of training is unclear. Should the invitation go to the NCP? What is the audience? Course and e-Net Managers for sure are the core target. Webinars should be used in a more strategic way. The WGL is concerned by the learning effect of the use of LMS. A survey should focus on who are the most frequent users; accessibility to webinars may be difficult from some countries. A proposal is brought forward by the group: an e-survey on the LMS should be launched as a survey tool. The WGL will provide the questions within two weeks. 7 \u2013 Post course learning reinforcement It is suggested to add two hours in each course on the use of the LMS to enable and motivate course managers, to generate more involvement. The policy with regards to post course learning reinforcement should be revised due to the adding of LMS. A small \u201cready-to-use\u201d module should be added on the LMS.", "url": "https://cepol.europa.eu/media/news/23rd-working-group-learning-meeting"}, {"id": "CEPOL_NEWS_0452", "date": "2011-10-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "CEPOL looks to the future with key partners", "text": "To mark a decade of police cooperation through learning, CEPOL \u2013 the European Police College welcomed Mrs V\u00e9ronique Mathieu, Member of the European Parliament, Stefano Manservisi, Director-General (DG HOME) of the European Commission, Ilkka Laitinen Director of Frontex, Michel Quill\u00e9 Deputy-Director of Europol, Rafael Fernandez-Pita of the General Secretariat of Council of the European Union, Justice and Home Affairs, Radek Khol and Kenneth Deane EEAS, former and future Presidencies, representatives from international organisations and third countries and National Police Authorities to Bramshill on Tuesday 4 October to celebrate its 10 year anniversary. The event, attended by 67 invited guests, and which featured an afternoon programme of key note addresses and an interactive panel discussion on the future of European law enforcement training, took place in a very favourable context. Mrs Mathieu, MEP and member of the European Parliament\u2019s Budgetary Control Committee, announced that the Committee had voted to recommend that the European Parliament discharge CEPOL\u2019s financial accounts to the 2009 budgetary year. Participants had the opportunity to reflect upon the past, as they enjoyed a photography exhibition of images that captured the spirit and content of CEPOL over the last ten years. The event started with a formal luncheon, during which participants were welcomed by the CEPOL Director Dr Ferenc B\u00e1nfi and Chair of the CEPOL Governing Board, Ms Eliza W\u00f3jcik. Following this, the programme began with the keynote speakers. While each acknowledged CEPOL\u2019s 10 year anniversary, the focus was very much on the future. In the absence and on behalf of Andrej Matejuk, Chief Commander of the Polish Police, Rafat Lysakowski, Director of the International Police Cooperation Bureau, addressed the audience on the unique contribution of CEPOL in terms of exchange of knowledge and experience within the European Union. Stefano Manservisi of the European Commission, gave the case for a European Training Scheme, an enhanced European police culture and further integration of the JHA agencies and Kenneth Deane, Head of Operations, Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC), European External Action Service spoke of the need for increasing the cooperation with CPCC and Crisis Management and Planning (CMPD) within the frame of Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Overall, the speakers welcomed CEPOL\u2019s ability to deliver quality learning to a wide audience, underlining the future need for quality over quantity, as well as complementarity and coordination rather than duplication. During the following panel discussion, Dr B\u00e1nfi introduced a number of challenging questions on the future of law enforcement to a panel that was made up of representatives from the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament, the European External Action Service, Europol, Frontex and CEPOL. Audience participation ensured lively debate on topics such as the European dimension of law enforcement training, developing a police culture, the need to bring learning and training closer to an operational level and accreditation of courses and training. The event also served as the launch for new additions to the suite of CEPOL publications: Visions to vision: A decade of CEPOL \u2013 a photographic album of CEPOL through the years Anniversary Reflections: A decade of European Cooperation in Police Training \u2013 a collection of personal experiences of CEPOL from key members of the CEPOL network New philosophy, new possibilities \u2013 Recommendations to strengthen CEPOL\u2019s role in the training of law enforcement personnel By the end of the programme, participants left with a deeper insight into CEPOL\u2019s future years; years that will be shaped by qualitative thinking delivering qualitative education.

THB Facts and Figures The exact extent of THB globally is not known for sure and estimates vary widely though a conservative UN estimate puts the figure at around 2.5 million. Described by a UN working group on the subject, THB is described as modern slavery that traps more people today than in the entire 400 years of the transatlantic slave trade. Moreover, according to Blue Blindfold, a UK-based THB awareness and prevention campaign, THB is the third largest source of income for organised crime groups and growing even faster than trafficking in illegal arms and drugs. \u201cAccording to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), about 12.3 million people worldwide are in forced labour, bonded labour, forced child labour or sexual servitude at any given time. Other estimates range between 4 million and 27 million. According to US government-sponsored research, about 800,000 people are trafficked across national boundaries each year, about 80% of whom are women and girls and \u201cup to 50%\u201d are children.\u201d House of Commons Home Affairs Committee, The Trade in Human Beings: Human Trafficking in the UK, Sixth Report of Session 2008\u201309 Volume I Article 2 of the EC Directive on THB defines trafficking in human beings as: \u201cThe recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or reception of persons, including the exchange or transfer of control over those persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.\u201d According to a Frontex Risk Analysis report, Situational Overview on Trafficking in Human Beings, 6,991 potential victims of trafficking were reported by 27 countries in 2009, up 34% on the 2008 figure of 5,200 potential victims. Of the total, almost 25% of identified victims were men and 15% were minors. The types of trafficking were defined as follows: The exploitation of the prostitution of others; Other forms of sexual exploitation; Forced labour or services; Slavery or practices similar to slavery; Servitude; Exploitation for activities associated with begging or for unlawful activities; and Removal of organs.

The Hungarian Presidency would like to present a brief summary of the activities carried out over the last six months: Hungary began its period in charge of the Presidency with the budget discharge procedure, budget accounts for 2008 were closed but CEPOL did not get a discharge and the EU Parliament has subsequently postponed the discharge of the 2009 budget. The Annual Activity Report 2010 of the Authorising Officer was completed by written procedure and sent to the relevant authorities. In accordance with Article 21 of Council Decision 2005/681/JHA dated 20 September 2005 establishing CEPOL, the Five Year External Evaluation has been carried out, with the Governing Board also making some recommendations and as a result the 24th Governing Board meeting established a project group for the Rationalisation of CEPOL Activities. The project group had its first meeting in May in Budapest and its second one in June in Balatonalm\u00e1di, Hungary. Based on Council Decision 2005/681/JHA the project group discussed the implementation of the short term recommendations made by the Governing Board and prepared a draft decision. Following discussions during the 25th Governing Board meeting the decision was adopted. In accordance with the decision all CEPOL committees \u2013 the Stategy Committee, the Budget and Administration Committee (BAC), the Training and Research Committee (TRC) and the Annual Programme Committee (APC) will be disbanded as of 1 January 2012. Hungary has followed up the implementation of the CEPOL Strategy and the Balanced Score Card started by Belgium in the previous semester. So far 69 Key Performance Indicators \u2013 25 strategic and 44 operational \u2013 have been adopted by the Governing Board in line with CEPOL\u2019s 4-year (2011-2014) strategic goals and objectives. CEPOL\u2019s Multi Annual Plan has been submitted to the European Parliament underlining the progress achieved; of the 44 milestones 38 have been completed and the remaining 6 are in progress. The Internal Audit Panel executed the first audit at the CEPOL Secretariat and provided a draft opinion on the 2010 Annual Accounts as per Article 16(5) of Council Decision 2005/681/JHA. The report has to be sent to the relevant authorities by 30 June 2011. The Governing Board also adopted the Annual Working Plan of the Internal Audit Panel. The implementation of the CEPOL European Police Exchange Programme inspired by Erasmus has progressed successfully during the Hungarian Presidency. The first part of the programme for senior police officers and members of training staff is taking place from May to August, 166 participants from 20 Member States submitted application forms. Following the great interest from Member States, CEPOL is considering implementing a second part of the programme in the 2nd half of 2011. The Cooperation Agreement with the Montenegro Police Academy, Danilovgrad was approved by the Governing Board and forwarded to the Council of the European Union for approval. The Cooperation Agreement with the Swiss Police Institute was revised and extended. The External Relations Policy Paper was revised and adopted by the Governing Board. The Governing Board adopted several decisions by written procedures. The amendment of Decision 30/2006/GB laying down administrative rules, commitments and guidelines for courses and seminars was also adopted with Decision 11/2011/GB. In May the European Commission\u2019s Internal Audit Service executed an audit at the CEPOL Secretariat and for the first time CEPOL did not receive any notification. The implementation of the Framework Partnerships and Grant Agreements was performed in the first half of 2011.

CEPOL has now had a new Director since February 2010 and is implementing its Multi Annual Action Plan in order to function correctly as an EU Agency and meet the standards expected by the CONT and European Parliament. The CEPOL of 2008 and 2009 no longer exists; CEPOL in 2011 is an organisation dedicated to excellence in all areas of activity. The recommendation does not come as a surprise since the year 2009 was marked by inadequacy and ineffectiveness in the areas of budget, procurement and human resources management. In addition the European Anti-Fraud Office\u2019s (OLAF) investigation has led to a referral for a criminal procedure against the former director. This fact casts a shadow over the achievements of 40 national training institutions in the Member States and draws the attention away from the core activities and the value added to the fight against crime through education and learning. Training courses, seminars, conferences, the exchange programme and other projects have brought together thousands of senior police officers, scientists and researchers in the last 5 years. The implementation of the Lisbon Treaty and the Stockholm Programme means that the coming years will be marked by increasing expectations of European law enforcement education. Building European training schemes is one aim that will result in a shift from quantitative to qualitative thinking in teaching and learning in law enforcement. Aligned with this trend, CEPOL will concentrate on the implementation of its approved strategy and address all of the CONT\u2019s expectations. The European Police College has been under new management since February 2010 and now performs the work of the Agency in line with all applicable regulations and legitimate expectations of all stakeholders.

Coming full circle, Bramshill is the place where Dr. Jan\u00f3s Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1ry chaired the first ever, and his last, Research and Science Working Group meeting. CEPOL Director, Dr. Ferenc Banfi, awarded him with a special CEPOL silver coin in recognition of his achievements as Chair of the Research and Science Working Group for more than three years. Dr. Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1ry will continue to support CEPOL's research and science activities as member of the Training & Research Committee and promised to be available for advice if needed. The working group has nominated Dr. Risto Honkonen (Finland) as the next Chair, while Dr. Lesley Duff (United Kingdom) will continue as Deputy Chair, pending Governing Board approval at the 22nd meeting. There were also changes in membership to note, as Francisco del Bario Romero had to move his professional career to a neighbouring continent and Prof. Johannes Knutsson had to retire because of new professional obligations in his home country. Member States answered the call for nominations by suggesting eight possible candidates, from which two were suggested to the Training and Research Commitee to be accepted and to be approved by the Governing Board. The new members will join the Research and Science Working Group at its 15th meeting in early 2011. Dr Ferenc Banfi took the opportunity to introduce the group members to CEPOL's new strategy in person, assisted by Deputy Director Detlef Schr\u00f6der. Reflections on the Multi-Annual Plan, its implications for the group and the focus of research and science activities in the years to come, made up a great part of the meeting. One of the outcomes was that the group will focus its work on drafting an action-plan, designed to point out practical steps to achieve the ambitious goals set out in the CEPOL's strategy. Another topic was the final report of the Sub-group 'Survey on European Police Education and Bologna'. Sub-group Chair, Dr. Eduardo Ferreira, had been invited to summarise the work procedures and the essential outcomes which will be presented to the Governing Board at the next meeting. Summary results will be made publicly available shortly after the meeting. Another major issue was the (self) assessment of publishing four issues of the European Police Science and Research Bulletin (the fourth issue is due in December). Achievements made, lessons learned and problems encountered on the way were listed to suggest that the trial period has been concluded successfully. It will be suggested to the Training and Research Committee and Governing Board to establish the Bulletin as a permanent CEPOL product, with three issues published per year. A map of European police research institutes, available on CEPOL's website, was unveiled and will be officially presented to the CEPOL community in the near future. The group also discussed ways to establish a new CEPOL Research Award and the project of a European Handbook of Policing, but decided to continue the discussion at the next meeting. In terms of the Work Programme 2011, the group will continue to provide support of the organisers of R&S activities. The meeting is scheduled to take place in France on 12-14 January 2011.

The Chair of the ERWG had the pleasure of welcoming two newcomers from Cyprus and Croatia, among the 19 participants to the meeting. The ERWG made concrete and substantial progress on the finalisation of CEPOL\u2019s External Relations Policy Paper, which is meant to respond to the opportunities and challenges for the European dimension of Law Enforcement training offered by the new EU Security Architecture, resulting from the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and the implementation of the Stockholm Programme and its Action plan. With this in mind, the ERWG took note of recent EU Commission communications on Internal Security. Recognising the important role played by its partner EU Agencies such as Europol, Frontex, Eurojust, the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) and others, the Committee on Internal Security (COSI), which CEPOL now regularly attends and the newly established European External Action Service (EEAS) alongside other key EU institutions and Partners as well as the Member States, the ERWG maintains its determination to advise qualitatively on how CEPOL can best serve this new European vision of security. The ever growing importance of the Internal/External Security Nexus, the implementation of a European Law Enforcement Training Scheme, as well as the need to enhance the professional skills of EU Officers deployed to Civilian Crisis Management Operations are just examples of what CEPOL can contribute to. The ERWG had the opportunity to discuss priorities for the years 2011 and 2012, which include, continuing the ongoing dialogue with Associated, Candidate and ENP countries as well as International and regional organisations. In particular, the ERWG reiterated the importance of concluding formal Cooperation Agreements with Switzerland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania. Cooperation with other strategic partners such as China and India was also discussed, with a view to examine the possibility of enhancing CEPOL\u2019s engagement with these important interlocutors, either via formal agreements or in the framework of ad-hoc initiatives and projects financed by the EU. Establishing cooperation with Russia will be looked at in the course of 2011. Future project opportunities and the involvement of CEPOL in EU Calls for Proposals and other financial assistance instruments were also discussed. Importantly, the efforts made by CEPOL to better integrating itself within the cluster of EU Justice and Home Affairs were examined, and the positive progress made was noted. The ERWG\u2019s next meeting will be in Estonia (7-8 July 2011) and Romania (7-8 November 2011).", "url": "https://cepol.europa.eu/media/news/serving-new-eu-security-architecture"}, {"id": "CEPOL_NEWS_0471", "date": "2011-02-02", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Working Group on Learning to become innovative with CEPOL\u2019s e-Net", "text": "During the 21st Working Group on Learning (WGL) meeting held in Bramshill, UK, on 6-7 January 2011, the members present continued their brainstorming session on preferred futuring (see 'Working Group on Learning to design its Preferred Futuring' news item) moderated by Dr. Zsolt Moln\u00e1r, the working group\u2019s Deputy Chair.

As NEC in Sweden, most of my efforts were put into learning about the exchange programme, but I also wanted to increase my knowledge about the rest of CEPOL and its tasks. My expectation was that my time in Bramshill should not only be a study visit, but also give me the possibility to take active part in the exchange programme work. After introductions, I was assigned the task of evaluating the second exchange period. This was a perfect way of looking into a completed exchange period and seeing both the appreciation and problems related to the exchanges. I really enjoyed this work and it gave me a different angle on the project. Meeting most of the Secretariat staff and having the opportunity to discuss their work was also fruitful. It became obvious to me that the Secretariat\u2019s staff is a group of dedicated and very hard working people. However, even though the staff has a heavy workload, I always felt welcome. This exchange has given me a lot of new ideas which will hopefully lead to the development of the future exchange programme work, both for the Secretariat and at national levels. Even though I learnt much, I believe the highlight of my exchange was meeting and getting to know the staff working at the Secretariat. Personal contact and communication cannot be overestimated! I would recommend similar visits, especially for other NECs. I believe that closer cooperation between the NEC\u2019s and the Secretariat, and increasing knowledge about each others\u2019 work, can only enhance the quality of the exchange programme work.

The length of the exchange periods was usually between 12 \u2013 14 calendar days for both police officers and trainers. During the third exchange period, nearly all the exchangees had the role of both exchangee and tutor. During the first and second exchange periods, the feedback response rate was between 50-60% and overall, the feedback received was very positive. During the third exchange period, both exchangees and tutors were asked to provide their feedback via an online survey in order to increase responses and speed up the rate of feedback. The response rate was 90% (74 out of a possible 82). Follow-up feedback was mandatory during all exchange periods and was sent by email by the participants to their National Exchange Coordinators (NECs). From the NECs, it was forwarded to the Secretariat. For the third exchange period, there was an 85% response rate (70 responses in total). The feedback for the third and last exchange period was generally very positive and the higher rate of feedback did not influence the earlier results. The following are some results from the online survey for the third exchange period. 93% stated they succeeded in meeting the defined objectives to gain a better understanding of police standards and procedures in the host country 99% said they gained more understanding of the organisation of the law enforcement authorities and other bodies in the hosting country 93% strongly agreed or agreed that the objectives to exchange knowledge, experiences and best practices with their counterpart in the hosting country were fulfilled 65% stated they gained other knowledge from the exchange than the original objectives 83% stated they developed a professional network in the area of the relevant topics 92% agreed that the duration of the exchange period was sufficient to fulfill their objectives 94% were satisfied with the accommodation provided during the exchange 96% stated they were satisfied with the support and service received from the Secretariat Where comments were encouraged, among them were: \u201cCould not have been better\u201d; \u201cPerfect\u201d; and \u201cthe hotel used was sufficient, but not more\u201d. The use of the Learning Management System during the third exchange period was clearly a challenge for participants with 28% disagreeing that LMS is a very clear and user-friendly tool. Some work is needed in this area to prepare for the next Exchange Programme. From the follow-up feedback, it became apparent that potentially more than 100,000 police officers gained knowledge from the exchange programme through articles, lectures, meetings, and so on.

G\u00f6ran\u2019s exchange was with the Lithuanian Ministry of the Interior within the topic crime prevention. In Sweden G\u00f6ran is involved in many different areas and projects, mainly crime prevention, violence in society and \u2018everyday\u2019 crime. The Lithuanian Ministry of Interior is responsible for Police Department, State Border Guard Service, Financial Crime Investigation Service, Fire Prevention and Rescue Department, Public Security Service and VIP Protection Department, among others. G\u00f6ran said: \u201cThe whole experience was extremely positive and I would certainly recommend it; not only to police officers in Sweden, but also to police officers throughout Europe. In fact I am in the process of writing about my experience which will be shared with all officers in Sweden. \u201c He added: \u201cThere is no doubt that as police officers we can all become rather set in the way we work and the CEPOL Exchange Programme is the ideal way to see different working methods and approaches first-hand.\u201d He admitted that although the exchange period schedule was busy, it was definitely worthwhile. \u201cI visited a lot of different areas including the Forensic Centre, Vilnius International Airport, Crime Prevention Centre and the State Border Guards. What struck me in particular was the work that the Lithuanian Police do with young people - an area that is not a priority in Sweden these days. There are \u2018police clubs\u2019 and \u2018traffic schools\u2019 where young people can not only meet police officers face-to-face, but learn from them too. At the traffic schools, young people learn how to behave in traffic. This forms part of the Swedish education system but I felt that it was more effective when the young people interact with \u2018real\u2019 police officers from a young age. In the outer neighbourhoods of Vilnius there are also what are termed as \u2018police clubs\u2019. In the satellite police offices, young people are encouraged to visit. With social workers in residence as well as police officers, they can go to meet and talk or to simply use the space if they have problems at home.\u201d This was very much in evidence when G\u00f6ran met a young girl who explained that she had not been able to do any school work at home for weeks due to family problems but thanks to the \u2019police club\u2019, she was able to work in a peaceful environment. G\u00f6ran added: \u201dI think many countries would do well to consider this approach when considering crime prevention techniques.\u201d Another highlight for G\u00f6ran was the Dog Training Centre in Vilnius for police and border dogs. He said: \u201cIt goes to show that you are never too old to learn something new! Amazingly when a crime has been committed but the suspect is not caught, they are able to \u2018bottle the criminals smell\u2019 and keep it in the laboratory for up to five years.

Fifty-four participants and 14 experts from 24 different countries, Europol and Interpol took part in the conference. The participants were offered lectures from specialised researchers and could actively take part in discussions and working groups. Several topics which cross the borders of police research, were presented during the conference: Professor Wouter Stol\u2019s research on operational police work in Europe \u2013 Policing the Streets of Europe Professor Tore Bj\u00f8rgo and Dr. SIlje Fekj\u00e6r\u2019s research on Police students\u2013 who are they?

A constant \u201cEuropean Dimension\u201d could be felt during the conference which was underlined by great discussions and insightful participants. Important new considerations were reached during discussions regarding successful and legal investigative methods. Precious new ideas were also shared in the fields of illegal immigration and use of firearms within police forces. These ideas and considerations, seen in the context of European police culture, are fundamental for the future of police related research in Europe. During the conference CEPOL discovered a potential new partner for specific courses and/or support to research projects. The International Investigative Interviewing Research Group (iIIRG) was formed in 2007 and is a worldwide network of professionals, with collaborative interests, working with international bodies committed to improving investigative interviewing and ensuring all improvements are underpinned by a robust evidence base. The Bologna process focuses on the necessity of mobility as a means to understanding different cultures, necessary to increase the quality of education and research. The European Union is striving to create a single \u2018European Research Area\u2019 that encourages knowledge transfer through networks of world-class European researchers. This conference was a large step towards that goal.

This base is set up according to CEPOL's approach to online learning (18/2010/GB) and includes knowledge for the sections containing practical video based cases, a glossary clarifying Schengen related terminology and structure for national legal framework matrices related to Schengen. Further topics covered include cross border police cooperation and an elaborated knowledge base for in depth exploration of the Schengen domain for senior police officers. In addition to the content development, the Project Group had suggestions for improving the approach to learning. These suggestions see users of the module contribute their experience and good practices to specific elements that make up the Schengen work field. In doing so users build up an EU network knowledge structure which surpasses their national work domain in regarding Schengen. The suggestions for improved user interaction allow police officers from all Member States to learn from and with each other. The improvements will be discussed with CEPOL's Working Group on Learning after which the Approach to Online Learning will be amended accordingly. The next step in finalisation of the content development of the Schengen online learning module is its distribution to the CEPOL network.

In the presence of seven members of the ERWG, the Belgian Presidency, two observers from the EU, Cyprus and Greece, two candidate countries, Croatia and Turkey, two new partners to be, Georgia and the Secretariat of the Police Cooperation Convention for Southeast Europe (PCC SEE), the ERWG met for the third and last time in 2010. The external relations policy was adjusted to be consistent with the new priorities for CEPOL in terms of strategy (Stockholm programme, Lisbon Treaty, CEPOL Strategy adopted by the Governing Board (Decision 43/2010GB) on the 30th September 2010, methodology defined by the Belgian Presidency. Inspired by the \u201cPlan, Do, Check, Act\u201d (PDCA) Deming cycle, this method aims at supporting the Presidency and Director on matters arising from External requests for cooperation or change, including the procedure to be followed when materialising cooperation agreements and processes to be implemented for cooperation with candidate and potential candidate countries. Four phases will be followed (Prospection, including a proactive market analysis, Materialisation, Implementation and Evaluation). Therefore, the policy paper, adopted in 2008, was amended to integrate the necessary changes; the working party in charge of the review was tasked to further elaborate on the included table related to the calculation of costs for the different categories of countries. To achieve its tasks, it was proposed that the working party should meet once with a financial expert from the Secretariat. Cooperation with Russia was debated. The group will recommend to the Strategy committee to ask the Director to proceed as soon as possible and find out what is possible to realize with the Russian federation and if they agree on the changes proposed by the legal services of the Council of the EU. A facts finding mission should be sent to Russia as soon as possible to clarify these issues and in the meantime the Director was asked by the ERWG to speed up the negotiations and meet the Russian representatives. Cooperation agreement with the Turkish Institute will be signed by both parts beside the Governing Board to be held in Limelette in December. This should be the ultimate step of a long process allowing us to reinforce our mutual cooperation. Georgia presented its request for cooperation with CEPOL. Both the Head of International Affairs from the Ministry of Interior and the Head of training unit in the police academy were present. They explained that formalized cooperation would allow setting a framework for future cooperation: It was stressed that cooperation became permanent with Georgia for some EU Member states already (e.g. Poland) so that formalize cooperation would be a natural further step building on existing cooperation. They already developed cooperation with Europol and Frontex. The next step will consist in sending a facts finding mission from CEPOL and identifying the possible NCP for CEPOL in Georgia; The Secretariat of the PCC SEE(*) presented their request for cooperation, aiming at securing long term cooperation with CEPOL. The working group on harmonized training elaborated different draft common curricula (train the trainers) and would be happy to get access the experience from CEPOL to avoid overlapping, with a European perspective in mind. The recommendation from the ERWG to the Strategy Committee is to move on with PCC SEE after having checked the legal advice from the council of the EU; The facts finding mission to Albania was debated and the ERWG agreed to take on further steps towards cooperation. A cooperation agreement will be drafted and sent to the Albanian part. Two fact findings missions will be launched in Montenegro and Liechtenstein: A mission composed by a representative from the ERWG, from the Secretariat and from the Belgian Presidency will be sent. AEPC announced their willingness to further facilitate cooperation with colleagues from outside the EU and informed the group that two new members joined the association: Bosnia and Herzegovina and Lithuania. Least but not last the ERWG members met in a close session to go through the five applications received after the call for nominations launched to fill the vacancy in the group. As an outcome, the ERWG members thanked Belgium, Denmark, Greece and Sweden for their excellent candidates and elected unanimously their new member Maurice Petit, from Belgium, Chair of AEPC who will ensure continuity in the policies set by the group.

The exercise concentrated on the 5th and 6th steps of the process \u201cfrom vision to action\u201d and was an opportunity for all members to \u201cdesign\u201d their preferred future, rather than just \u201cproject\u201d it. A tour de table gave everyone the chance to contribute to the brainstorming session, from two different prospective: \u201cMe, Myself and I\u201d and \u201cthe Working Group on Learning\u201d. The outcome generated a priority list of topics to which focus should be given. Particular attention should be paid to the following items: Creativity, Pro-activity, Innovation, Structural changes, Niche-markets, Access to on-line learning, Supporting quality The meeting also discussed the \u201crevised\u201d questionnaire for line managers issued by the Secretariat under mandate of the Annual Programme Committee (APC). Three members worked on this issue and revised the proposal for the Training and Research Committee (TRC). The results of the Post Course Evaluation Questionnaire (PCEQ) for Line Managers are used to measure level 3 of Kirkpatrick\u2019s evaluation system: the behavioral level. In the WGL\u2019s opinion, the way of working proposed in the PCEQ for Line Managers is an efficient, combined solution to the problems detected. Finally, the WGL recommends that the Secretariat start working with the new revised PCEQ for Line Managers and regularly revise the outcomes, so that the PCEQ keeps reflecting the actual answers from the Line Managers. Adding an indication of how long completing the questionnaire might take to its introduction text would also prove beneficial. The WGL continued an evaluation process of the \u201cTrain the trainers\u201d CEPOL activity. The course should develop a conscious didactic approach, a vocational approach focusing on police and law enforcement authorities, and aim at creating common knowledge. The activity should be based on the competency profile for trainers, elaborated by the WGL which clearly lists the requirements. The Chair drew the focus to the activity\u2019s educational efficiency: \u201cwhich method is good for what?\u201d and \u201cIs there a lack of content?\u201d As the WGL is a contributor of content to this activity, it was proposed that at least one member of the group attend the activity in 2011, so that lessons learned from previous experience not go lost. The group will also reconsider the Glossary issue and will come back with a proposal after further enquiries are made by the working group and the Secretariat. Note: Preferred Futuring is a method of strategic, long range planning that is especially effective in non-profit organisations where incentive and reward is more intrinsic than in business. Created by Dr. Lawrence Lippitt, Preferred Futuring is a whole system change methodology. It enables an organisation to plan for and construct the future they want and inspire the passion and energy to follow through and get there. The Futuring model focuses on core values. It aligns the pursuit of operational and performance excellence with our mission. It is based on the truth that all stakeholders can and must participate meaningfully in the present and future states of our organisation. The process contains eight clear and simple steps: Our History; A Focused Review: How and why did we get where we are? In Step One, a brief historical \u201cscan\u201d is performed, sharing what we know throughout the decades of our history. One summarizes lessons learned and consequences: circumstances that made us who we are. Our Current Situation: An Assessment: What\u2019s working\u2026. and what\u2019s not? In Step Two, one assesses whether we are doing the right things and how well we are doing them. Mission, Values and Beliefs: Identifying what is important? Who are we? What guiding stars will direct our future? In Step Three, one looks at the results of the Organisational Assessment data, determines ones mission and core values. Forecasting Events, Developments and Trends: Identifying Future Factors: What things are on the horizon that may impact our future? In Step Four one scans the horizon for things that may be coming that will impact the future. Our Preferred Future: Creating the Vision: What is the future we want to create? In Step Five one evaluates and summarizes the suggestions of members and creates a preferred vision for our future. Translating Future Visions into Action Goals: What achievements will be made in creating our vision? In Step Six, one creates goals that represent the components needed to achieve the vision. Developing a Plan for Action: What strategies will support the achievement of the goal? In Step Seven, we create strategies and actions to achieve the goals. Working the Plan: Putting the plan and the people in place and working the plan. In Step Eight, one creates and maintains the infrastructure to carry out ones plans.

As a consequence of CEPOL\u2019s recently intensified cooperation with Frontex, the group\u2019s discussions were enriched by the presence of Friedrich Scheuermann, Training Project Officer in the field of e-learning from Frontex. Many topics and issues were covered during the meeting including: Development of plot lines for e-learning cases; Identifying key topics that need to be covered in the field of the Schengen Agreement and the Convention Implementation of the Schengen Agreement (CISA); Making sure that the professional domain of the senior police officer is represented in the on-line module thus guaranteeing decision taking related to CISA legal instruments. One of the main challenges the Project Group members during the meeting was finding a way of mapping essential learning processes to Schengen related strategic decisions and transforming them into an appropriate instructional design in an attractive self-paced learning context. A future meeting of the Project Group is scheduled for October 2010 in which, amongst others, the experts will focus on the development of a self diagnostic test, related to identifying a learning path as part of a newly designed 'My Progress' learner tool.

Representatives of the current Belgian Presidency, incoming Hungarian Presidency and future Polish Presidency, as well as members of CEPOL Secretariat, met to discuss CEPOL\u2019s priorities. When Belgium took over on the 1 July 2010, they already highlighted their planned objectives for the six months, stressing fundamental aspects of the strategic framework in terms of vision, effectiveness, efficiency and high quality of service delivery towards customers, taking into account the European dimension of the achievements. At the meeting, the wish for the continuity of the key actions instigated by the Belgians was discussed. Despite the reorganisation of the Hungarian CEPOL Team, the Hungarian priorities presented by Emese Horvaczy, demonstrate a real spirit of continuity of the objectives defined by the Belgian Presidency and this in a way of extending the training scope. The Polish priorities also follow the same spirit of continuity and Andrzej Zawadzki proposed some very interesting projects, including: \u2018managing safety of mass events\u201d and \u2018Police Eastern Partnership programme in the field of European neighbourhood policy. All present agreed to the desire to contribute to the improvement of the management of CEPOL. Topics discussed included CEPOL\u2019s Strategic Framework and Balanced Scorecard System, the drawing up of the European Police Exchange Project charter, the annual workflow, budget optimisation and the necessity to plan reserve activities in order to avoid under spending, the five-year evaluation, the promotion of the electronic era and the external relations policy. The Belgian representatives, said: \u201cOur thoughts and actions demonstrated a clear unanimity in the desire to contribute to the improvement of the management of CEPOL in order to maximize the use of financial resources aimed to achieve the core activities\u201d. In addition, Belgium outlined some practical proposals in order to improve the quality of the CEPOL courses, including: ensuring activity reports are made available on CEPOL\u2019s e-Net, a database of trainers, design of courses (workshops, role playing games, etc.,) and ensure the systematic use of the Learning Management System. As CEPOL will celebrate its five year anniversary as an EU agency next year, the spirit of cohesion and continuity clearly established by the Presidency representatives constitutes evidence of harmony.

Sgt. Don Casey, London Metropolitan Police and Prof. Phillip Burrell, London South Bank University, present their research on how, using statistical evidence, a computerised support system could assist investigators solving serious sexual offenses. Chief Constable Bernhard Welten, Dutch Police Force, left the participants of the 2009 CEPOL Police Research and Science Conference intrigued with his appeal to senior police officers to embrace the spirit and contributions of scientists towards improving policing. His perspective on the relation between police practice and scientific methodologies will surely be food for thought and trigger further discussions.

From the meetings, it was apparent that Albania is interested in bringing their training closer to European standards. They expressed a strong wish to utilise CEPOL\u2019s Common Curricula. Currently in Albania, police training is the responsibility of the Police Training Directorate, one of five Directorates under the General Directorate of State Police. The focus is mainly on basic training, and at present they are re-training 9,000 serving police officers in line with a new law issued in 2007. Apart from their regular training for new recruits, training is centralised in Tirana; only in-service training is done in the regional police forces. There is also education for mid-level management, however none for senior police officers. Detlef Schr\u00f6der said: \u201cDuring our visit, we issued an invitation to the European Neighbourhood Policy conference which takes place in Rome in December.

The primary purpose of the Symposium is to create an environment where international criminologists, policy makers, practitioners and others engaged in criminal policy matters can partake of the latest research findings of importance for crime policy. The main topic for the 2010 symposium was 'Improving Policing'. Among other well-known institutions, CEPOL was offered the opportunity to organise dedicated panel sessions. The aim was to present research projects affiliated with or facilitated by CEPOL to a wider international expert audience. Two sessions were scheduled for the morning of the second day of the Symposium, chaired by Dr. Detlef Nogala. Under the title 'Working on a European approach to police science' Prof. Rob Mawby (United Kingdom) presented the work and resulting report of the CEPOL Project Group. Marianne Hilton (National Swedish Police Board) presented the outline of a EU funded project featuring 'Comparative field studies in policing public order in Europe', which goes back to the first Research Symposium CEPOL organised in 2009. CEPOL is an associated partner in this project, providing a 'projectspace' on its e-Net platform. Harry Peeters from the Police Academy of the Netherlands introduced CEPOL's Survey on European Police Education and Bologna (SEPEB) and outlined some of the preliminary results. In the second session Prof. Tore Bj\u00f8rgo from the Police University College in Norway reported about his project 'Recruitment, education and careers in the police - a European longitudinal and comparative study', which has been inspired by his earlier membership in CEPOL's Project Group on a European Approach to Police Science. Prof. Johannes Knutsson, a current member of the CEPOL Research and Science Working Group, presented outcomes of his research project on 'Police use of firearms - an international comparison\u201d. The session was rounded up by a presentation of CEPOL's Research and Science activities by Dr. Detlef Nogala, highlighting the importance of scientific research as resource for higher police training and education in Europe. All the presenters underlined the benefits of comparative research and invited participants to join and broaden the European coverage of the projects. Each of the sessions were attended by around 30 participants and triggered a lot of new contacts. By organising two sessions with a number of high quality and interesting project presentations, CEPOL put its name forward as serious facilitator of relevant scientific research in the area of policing and police education.

This role also sees Belgium chair the CEPOL Governing Board and Strategy Committee. The goals and objectives that Belgium has set for the remainder of 2010 are the following: The objectives of our Presidency are to ensure the visibility, the clearness and the coherence of CEPOL's actions in relation to the missions assigned to the agency in the framework of its statutes, of the European policy and in the interests of all Member States. We will assume the continuity of the previous actions launched by under the Spanish Presidency while integrating specific accents. The Belgian Presidency intends to focus on a return to CEPOL's core business i.e. training of senior police officers. In the same framework, the Presidency intends to take an active part in the definition and the implementation of the new European police exchange programme (EPEP) which was introduced by the Spanish Presidency. The accent will also be laid on the valorisation of the digital era, by promoting the use of e-Net through making an extensive use of the collaborative tools such as the Document Management System. The Belgian Presidency will continue the initiative launched under the Swedish Presidency. The implementation of a 'strategic framework' aiming at implementing the CEPOL strategy is paramount. CEPOL has put Belgium in charge of implementing this process during 2010. The objective is to provide the Hungarian Presidency with a strategic frame of reference and a managerial toolbox allowing the follow-up and measure of CEPOL's core-business both on the quantitative and qualitative aspects in the perspective of an accountability and a policy of excellence towards the Commission. In the frame of the Budget and Administration Committee, Belgium will make proposals and recommendations on financial and administrative matters in order to optimize this process and to support the CEPOL Director in his efforts to orient the staff on a new competency-management basis Our aim is also to gain the trust of the European institutions, the Commission, the Council and the Parliament. Meanwhile, stressing that CEPOL is a network, we will underline the responsibilities of each network-member as an important actor in the success story of our agency.

Dr. Zsolt Moln\u00e1r, legal advisor for the Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement in Hungary, has been a member of the Hungarian Police Force for more than sixteen years. The group also welcomed new member Piet de Brouwer to his first meeting. Piet de Brouwer is a police officer from the Belgian Police and is responsible for the training of senior police officers in his country. The group focused on the preferred future methods of working for the group. In a workshop moderated by the newly elected Deputy Chair, new ideas and polishing CEPOL activities were initiated. \u201cThe Working Group on Learning should concentrate on opportunities, heritage, main values and outcomes, with a short retrospection. History can explain the current situation and help to set future action,\u201d explained Zsolt. The Chair recommended: \u201cEvery member should participate in the discussions and express [clearly] their views\u201d. A \u201ctour de table\u201d was chosen so everyone could contribute to the brainstorming session. Sandra Wijkhuijs, former Chair of the group, reported on her experiences, stressing that \u201ca lot had already been achieved\u201d. According to the Training and Research Committee Action Plan, the Working Group on Learning took on board all the topics they were tasked with (Q13, Train the trainers, Bologna, Evaluation, Learning Strategy, development of e-learning and LMS). The respective roles of the group and CEPOL Secretariat were complementary and did not overlap with each other. The major contribution of Theo Brekelmans was stressed by the group, an analysis shared by Joao Caba\u00e7o and Wolfgang Kokoska (trainers on the Train the Trainer\u2019s course). David I\u2019anson stressed the necessary improvements to timely delivery and work processes. He reiterated that not everyone should necessarily be involved in the work of the group, but experts on the topics should be designated and report back to the group as a whole. As David will be the next Training and Research Committee Chair, he sees a conflict of interest between these two responsibilities and will resign form the Working Group on Learning at the end of year. He recommended that the group should focus on their core tasks and leave discussions that are not always relevant to this group to the other Committees and Working Groups. Joe Carton (Ireland) presented a possible accreditation process for CEPOL training activities. Marek and Joe will work together on the issue. Also discussed were the relevant outcomes of last Training and Research Committee meeting; the \u201crevised\u201d questionnaire for line managers issued by the Secretariat which were mandated by the Annual Programme Committee.

In spite of all the circumstances, events and contingencies, many advances have been made during our Presidency. The success of the Spanish Presidency has been built up throughout commitment, accountability, mutual trust and transparency. We began our Presidency with the Lisbon Treaty and the approval of the Stockholm Programme. Both of them, along with the Internal Security Strategy \u2013 Spanish initiative approved under this Presidency by the European Council \u2013, gave us a new political momentum in the field of Security an Justice setting up a demanding and challenging framework. This was also an excellent starting point for discussions to reach the consolidation and development of CEPOL. We would like to stress that the Spanish Presidency has had to face noteworthy vicissitudes in the Agency, especially the change of Director and circumstances related to the former one which have been carried out and managed to round off the issue with clearness and responsibility. The current Presidency has shared with all of you the desire to advance towards a better CEPOL. In this regard, we have promoted a series of initiatives at the beginning of the Presidency, aiming, all of them, at strengthening the police cooperation instruments and forging a European common police culture. In this context CEPOL has reached the following objectives during the Spanish Presidency: The Exchange Programme for police officers inspired by Erasmus approved by the Council that will allow changing experiences and best practices and will contribute to forge a European police culture. Establishment of the European Police Exchange Programme Project Group (EPEPPG) and Working Group (EPEPWG) which will work on the development, implementation and evaluation of the Exchange Programme inspired by Erasmus. The agreement on developing a CEPOL strategy which will be finalized during the Belgian Presidency. CEPOL will have a commonly developed and clearly articulated strategy where the structure and governance of the Agency will be reconciled to guarantee the accomplishment of the objectives. A Multi Annual Action Plan 2011-2014 has been approved and will be implemented to improve the functioning of CEPOL. A Multi Annual Staff Policy Plan 2011-2013 has been agreed to be put into effect. Formation of an Audit Panel to provide governance oversight on the efforts of the new management team to improve the administration and operation of the agency. In particular to provide assurance to the Governing Board of any measures taken by CEPOL to bring the finances into full alignment with the CEPOL and European Commission Financial Regulations as well as the principles of sound financial management. A pilot project about CEPOL Permanent Representation will be put in place. In order to improve College governance a pilot project has been approved under the Spanish Presidency in which the number of Governing Board meeting will be reduced during 2011. All the necessary steps have been taken to implement the Framework Partnerships and Grant Agreements in the realm of CEPOL. A third exchange period has been granted by the Commission. We can conclude that we have scored some points in several areas and we have managed to maintain continuity through change. Finally, I would like to express my deep gratitude to Dr. Ferenc B\u00e1nfi, Director of CEPOL, and CEPOL Secretariat for their engagement and willingness to help in our Presidency tasks and I also wish to thank the Belgian Presidency team for their willingness and unconditional support.

Dr Detlef Nogala, CEPOL Secretariat, said: \u201cThe predecessor to CEPOL\u2019s e-Library was also tailored to those with a legitimate interest in police research and findings and was well-used. We have been working hard to ensure the e-Library could also be rolled out to a wider user base and I am delighted it is now open for academic users. I hope the system will grow considerably so that all e-Library users, police, police trainers and academics, can benefit from each other.\u201d Further information regarding e-Net and the CEPOL e-Library can be found in the \u201c About e-Net\u201d section of the website. Specific information about the administration of user rights for e-Net can be found in CEPOL Governing Board decision 39/2009/GB.

The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and the recent approval of the Stockholm Programme by the European Council will mean not only a new political impulse in the field of Security and Justice so as a significant challenge for the Presidential trio to reach the consolidation and development of their contents. Being conscious of the work ahead, the Presidency of the Union will promote the adoption of an Internal Security Strategy as a key element to strengthen a European Space able to respond to the citizens\u2019 needs in the framework of our common culture. Likewise, Spain will also promote a series of initiatives aimed at strengthening the police cooperation instruments that brings a higher efficacy in the fight against terrorism, illegal immigration, domestic violence, missing persons and organised crime in its various forms. In the same way, and with the aim to pay special attention to the most vulnerable groups, the development and implementation of a Good Police Practices Manual to combat gender-based violence will be promoted. However, a common culture able to respond to the new needs in the field of an open and secure Europe should emphasize the unique value of training within the so-called \u201cEuropean dimension\u201d; therefore CEPOL, as European Police College, has to significantly contribute to the fight and prevention of crime and the maintenance of public order and security within the new framework of the Stockholm Programme. In this context, the Spanish Presidency has set the following objectives: Drawing up a pilot project on an Erasmus-style exchange programme that, based on a harmonised police training, allows mobility and exchange of experiences and best practices and contribute to the creation of a European police identity. Development of a multi-annual strategic plan where the structure of CEPOL regarding decision making and execution may be adjusted to guarantee the performance of the objectives. Reinforcement of the role of CEPOL among the European bodies and institutions. Establishment of inter-agencies teamwork to maximize the agreements already in place. Adjustment of the 2011 Work Programme to the stipulations of the Stockholm Programme. Boost the development and implementation of the common curricula as key element for a common training culture. These and any other aims or initiatives that could have a positive effect in the mission and purpose of CEPOL as Agency and on the European citizen as the central element of the policy of the Union, will be borne in mind during the period that now begins. I sincerely hope that during the next six months our common effort, based on engagement and mutual confidence, can achieve those results that have turned CEPOL into a key element within the Institutions of the European Union. Finally, I wish to express my appreciation for the excellent work done by the Swedish Presidency and its unconditional support to the following Presidency.

We have just handed over the Chairman\u2019s gavel and outstanding issues to the incoming Spanish Presidency. When I look back and try to summarise the past six months, there are a few things striking my mind. First of all, in the capacity of Chair of the CEPOL Governing Board, there has been a great pleasure to work together with you. I would like to seize the opportunity to express my appreciation for all the good efforts all of you have invested in CEPOL, and in particular the very good cooperation we have had with the incoming Presidencies of Spain and Belgium as well as with the Director and the Secretariat. It is my firm belief that CEPOL will be in good hands during 2010. So, what did we achieve? When I use the word we, I don\u2019t refer to Swedish Presidency as such but to all of us We initiated the selection process of a new CEPOL Director and he will be in place as of 1 February 2010. Congratulations Dr. Banfi! We have approved Terms of Reference for the five year evaluation of CEPOL to be published in the Official Journal of the European Union in order to commence the tendering process. We have started the process to develop a CEPOL Strategy. We have enhanced the utilisation of the CEPOL website as a main tool of communication. We have a policy paper in place pertaining to the utilisation of the Document Management System. We have initiated a practice where the Presidency chair network conferences, which we believe is important to recognise the good work and ambitions of our NCPs, Research and Science Correspondents, National Common Curricula Coordinators, National e-Net Managers and Exchange Programme Coordinators. We have initiated the disbandment of groups in the structure which have finalised their tasks. The first Research & Science Bulletin has been published. The book on Police Science has been published. We have continued the practice of CEPOL performance in international fora, e.g. the Stockholm Criminology Symposium. We have tried to develop the procedures during Government Board meetings by introducing A, B and C-points, even though the result has not been conspicuous. With pleasure I can conclude that the Heads of Units picked up their duties during the Swedish Presidency.

As the three-year membership cycle is soon coming to an end for many of the members, the Chair invited them to decide about the possibility for nomination for a second term. The call for nominations in the working group would be sent following the meeting. The group reflected on its achievements of the past and the challenges that lay ahead. In the discussions about the mid to long-term strategic perspectives, an urgent need for a reconsideration of the current remit was identified. The group worked on a proposal for an amendment of the remit. The group members agreed that the updated remit should reflect on the need for prioritisation of targets, expectations of internal and external stakeholders and the strategic element of its activities in relation to the further development of a European approach for CEPOL. A report was given about the Annual Meeting of the Research and Science Correspondents. The group discussed in depth the relationship and functional work shared between themselves and the correspondents. Other topics on the agenda were the budget and work programme 2010. For the dedicated research and science activities in particular (two symposia and a conference), the group intends to cooperate closely with the hosting countries (Ireland, Portugal, Norway and Sweden). With regard to the operation of the e-Library, the group clarified how to apply the \u2018peer-review\u2019 for submissions to the \u2018Scientific Collection\u2019.

Established in 1995, ENFSI is a network of national forensic science institutes whose purpose is to improve the quality of forensic science throughout Europe. The MoU allows both organisations to enhance cooperation in the areas of information exchange and training. It outlines that both organisations will identify issues that may be of interest to the other, such as, advances in forensic sciences that could assist criminal investigations; the use of established scientific techniques; and the dissemination of knowledge among senior police officers. The importance of forensic science for the police forces in Europe is underlined in the draft Stockholm Programme. Additionally, the MoU, states that ENFSI will: Identify and liaise with institutions who can potentially contribute to CEPOL training activities; Link to CEPOL\u2019s website and advertise CEPOL\u2019s training activities; Support CEPOL members who are asked to attend ENFSI meetings. The MoU states that CEPOL will: Allow ENFSI members to give courses on topics they feel require greater understanding and awareness in order to assist criminal investigations; Ensure ENFSI members are reimbursed for travel and subsistence when supporting CEPOL activities; Link to ENFSI\u2019s website and post information about latest developments in forensics, cases of interest, and so on. Both organisations will also discuss the possibilities of sharing data and databases about learning activities. CEPOL Head of Programmes, Detlef Schroeder, said: \u201cI am delighted we have signed a MoU with ENFSI.

The committee concluded that the CEPOL Secretariat should look at the offer of other agencies on the market regarding similar training activities as CEPOL\u2019s in order to avoid overlapping and doing so increase participation. Commenting on the statistics, an ongoing concern is the low representation in a number of countries regarding trainers and participants which could affect the European dimension in CEPOL activities. It was agreed that \u2018School Shooting\u2019 and \u2018Dismantling of Synthetic Drug Laboratories (Europol)\u2019 will be held in 2009 and repeated in 2010. Conferences with Russia and USA will be held every year, organised by CEPOL every second year. Two courses on \u2018Training of SIRENE Officers\u2019 will be included in 2009, with two also in 2010. Nine activities will be preliminarily removed from 2010 programme, while 5 added. Three e-learning modules on Pr\u00fcm Treaty, Police English and Europol will be finalised in 2009 and implementation could start this year, continuing in 2010. The Secretariat suggests that for 2010 the following four modules should start, changing the order of priority as follows: Schengen Cybercrime (awareness) Train the Trainer (replacing the common curriculum on the topic) Quality Standards in 13 Questions (Q13) The Director informed the committee that all MEDA activities had been cancelled due to the conflict in Gaza. CEPOL is now considering if the project should be extended, as it is due to end in June 2010, in order to have the possibility to organise all agreed activities. An overview was given about the CEPOL/Agis Exchange Programme and it was reported that CEPOL was waiting for a reply from the Commission regarding the possible continuation of the project in 2009-2010.

In his introductory remarks, Bo \u00c5str\u00f6m pointed out that research issues were of paramount importance for development and sustainable results. He stated that disseminating good practice and research findings is a core task of CEPOL. Bo \u00c5str\u00f6m also mentioned that \u2018research and science\u2019 in the CEPOL framework should be seen as an investment \u2013 an investment however that is expected to pay-off in view of CEPOL\u2019s objective to support and develop a European Approach to the main problems facing Member States in policing, and in particular, when it comes to cross-border issues. For some Research and Science Correspondents, this was their first contact with CEPOL so the updated presentations on recent developments within CEPOL, the Research and Science activities and the e-Library were a useful introduction to the meeting\u2019s agenda for all. Apart from hands-on practical session to become more familiar with the functionalities of e-Net, and in particular, of the duties in regard to the operation and workflows of the scientific collections of the e-Library, there was plenty of time to exchange information and good practice born out of recent experience. It became clear that the situation for each Research and Science Correspondents varies, not only in regard to the size of their country, but also in view of access to academic knowledge networks and the organisational support and resources they have at hand. Other issues discussed included: The general role and tasks of the Research and Science Correspondents; Organisation of workflows; Crucial steps in the submission process; Criteria for acceptance of submissions; Access for non-police officers (\u2018Academic user\u2019); Copyright issues; Utilisation of existing library databases; Tools of communication and cooperation for Research and Science Correspondents. Time was spent to present good practices in promoting CEPOL and the e-Library, where the Belgium\u2019s approach attracted a lot of interest. A session on how to best tackle common difficulties and problems, like copyright, concluded the practical part of the meeting. There was a clear consent among the Research and Science Correspondents that the Annual Meeting is a very valuable instrument in supporting their tasks and duties, as well as to develop a sense of the value and high potential of CEPOL\u2019s network. In his concluding remarks Bo \u00c5str\u00f6m underpinned this sentiment by highlighting the merits of good communication in a network inspired by professional competence and commitment.

Among the discussions was that each Member State could provide an overview of the police education systems on their own CEPOL web-pages. A template for an inventory of police and education data was debated and a short presentation given about the police in the United Kingdom. Other national presentations are expected for the next meeting and the template will be finalised by the group. As the mandate for six members of the Working Group on Learning will expire in mid-2010, it was agreed that a call for nominations for new members to the group will be made shortly. The Bologna Process Seminar outcomes were discussed in depth and the group will propose that the seminar should become an annual activity and that it should be merged with the European Police Education seminar. For further information about the seminar, see 'Related News' at the bottom of this page. A debate took place about the Common Curricula. It was stressed that Member States can only apply common curricula with some flexibility but noted that rules which are too strict may limit the effectiveness of the Common Curricula. The Working Group on Learning called for a handbook for Common Curricula. Regarding the Common Curriculum \u2018Money Laundering\u2019, the group had some reservations about the content and quality. The group endorsed two documents relating to the Volume II of the Q13: The study of CEPOL\u2019s Programme Evaluation System, presented at the 4th Governing Board meeting. A proposal was brought forward that the group should look beyond the Kirkpatrick model, to enlarge the reflection to some other concepts and models in terms of evaluation, quality assurance, quality management and Bologna; Recommendations for Course Managers which the group suggested to add the briefing of the trainers/lectures on the participants prior to the event and to include the participants\u2019 expectations. In the area of e-learning, several positive comments were made on the Police English Language e-learning module, regarding the approach of English terminology, through topics. The comments of the Commission concerning the performance indicators were discussed with regard to the remit of the Working Group on Learning. A proposal was made to set up one indicator about the measurement of activities organised in cooperation with other EU agencies: number of participants, trainers and co-organisers involved.

The meeting began with discussions about the collaboration of the National Coordinators with the Module Advisers. The Module Advisers are finishing developing the Common Curricula and will be engaged in the updates and in assisting Member States during the implementation. The outcomes of the 1st Annual National Common Curricula Coordinators Network meeting highlighted the need of a strong support for the national implementation, including: Boosting the production of translation of the Common Curricula already adopted by the Governing Board; Intensifying the cooperation between the Member States, the Secretariat and the Module Advisers; Organising implementing workshops on the adopted Common Curricula; Supporting Pilot Projects in Member States for the implementing of a Common Curricula. The Chair of the Working Group, Antonio Martinez Calatayud, commented that: \u201cFor implementation, the cascading effect is essential, and we should always aim for that in our planning and designing of initiatives, be it courses or workshops. Once we have a clear idea of what we want to realise, then we must give it the shape that is needed by the Member States.

The next coming years will be a challenge for CEPOL, in particular when the Stockholm Programme will be implemented. It will put some strong demands on CEPOL to improve and develop its core business, where Common Curricula is one of them, stated in the Council Decision 681/2005/JHA to establish CEPOL. The Swedish Presidency has high expectations on the outcome of this conference and you - the participants of this conference - are key players not only in this particular sense but also on how the Common Curricula will be received, handled and implemented in the Member States. When we close the conference I sincerely hope that a few objectives have been achieved in order to pave the way for the continuity of the important work to develop and implement Common Curricula. A mutual understanding of the paramount importance of the Common Curricula. A mutual understanding of the National Common Curricula Coordinators crucial role when it comes to promote and support the development and implementation of the Common Curricula in the Member States. An awareness of the Coordinators' tasks and responsibilities. Enhanced understanding of what the Secretariat and the Module Advisers can do in supporting the Coordinators. New ideas gained on how to perform the tasks of implementing Common Curricula successfully. New network established and developed. Last but not least, I believe it is of essential interest that you as Coordinators will be tasked to go back home to your countries and make an assessment of the preconditions for successful implementation of Common Curricula, including any obstacles, and report back no later than 1 November 2009. This state of play assessment will serve as basis for the future work within the network. When I look around and see all the experience and competency within the subject in matter gathered together here at Bramshill, I am personally convinced that all preconditions for a successful conference are in place. I wish you good speed in your difficult and important task, both during the conference of course but also for the future'.", "url": "https://cepol.europa.eu/media/news/1st-annual-common-curricula-coordinators-network-meeting"}, {"id": "CEPOL_NEWS_0565", "date": "2009-09-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "CEPOL to Test New Online Survey Tool", "text": "Much of CEPOL\u2019s work requires carrying out surveys and questionnaires in different areas, such as post-course evaluation. CEPOL wanted to find an online solution in order to be able to set-up, administer and analyse information more effectively and efficiently online.Following research into the various options available, the most appropriate one for CEPOL appeared to be \u2018LimeSurvey\u2019. On further research, it transpired that the Estonian Public Service Academy already uses LimeSurvey and as a result, CEPOL has signed a Service Level Agreement with the academy to test and explore the possibilities of using the open source online survey tool.CEPOL will try out the tool, test its features and study its potential and added value to the CEPOL Network until 1 July 2010.The current focus is on two projects: Post-course Evaluation of CEPOL Courses and Seminars (Governing Board Decision 30/2007/GB); Survey on European Police Education and Bologna (SEPEB) - a survey conducted on education programmes in the field of police and policing open to foreign police officers and about the implementation of the Bologna process in national police training institutes in Member States and in relevant cooperation partners (Survey on European Police Education and Bologna (Governing Board Decision 6/2009/GB). Ulf G\u00f6ransson, CEPOL Director, said: \u201cAlthough we are initially using LimeSurvey for two projects, the potential is that we can expand the use of it, making it easier for the network to carry-out surveys and generate data. I would like to take the opportunity to thank the Estonian Public Service Academy who generously offered its LimeSurvey services to the network.\u201dThe LimeSurvey tool could also potentially be used for other surveys relevant to CEPOL.

Organisers, participants, trainers and experts of CEPOL\u2019s courses and seminars now have a dedicated area on CEPOL\u2019s e-Net to support their activities. The LMS has many features and provides several additional benefits to both organisers and participants, including: An easy way to contact those who participate in a course; An online introduction to participants, trainers, experts and course managers; An overview of all those who participate in the course; A place to upload course material including presentations, hand-outs, useful links, videos, and so on; A possibility for participants to complete the course evaluation online - providing course managers with instant access to the results. Users with an account on CEPOL\u2019s e-Net, can access the LMS by selecting the \u2018Courses\u2019 tab after log-in. The LMS homepage provides the user with an overview of all the activities they participate in. The LMS supports those courses and seminars which will be implemented from 1 October 2009 onwards. In preparation of opening the LMS to the network, two Course Managers\u2019 LMS Training courses (97/2009 and 98/2009) were implemented earlier this month. Twenty-one Course Managers and National e-Net Managers (who will support course organisers with the set-up of their \u2018Courses\u2019 on the LMS) from 16 Member States were trained in setting up a course, adding participants and trainers/experts, uploading documents, moderating forums and preparing and carrying out the course evaluation for their own activity. The outcomes of both the LMS courses were positive and indicate that Course Managers, alongside their National e-Net Managers, feel comfortable using system as several have already started implementing their own activities in the system. The next LMS training for Course Managers will be organised later this year, targeted at those who are due to implement a CEPOL activity in the beginning of 2010. CEPOL Director, Ulf G\u00f6ransson, said: \u201cCourses and seminars are CEPOL\u2019s core business, so I am delighted that we have opened the LMS today \u2013 the penultimate system of the CEPOL\u2019s electronic network to go public.

The aim of the meeting was to inform the Commission of the Swedish priorities and ambitions during its Presidency pertaining to CEPOL, to discuss outstanding issues and to give the Commission the opportunity to clarify its position in current issues as well as declare its intentions for the future of CEPOL. Before the meeting the Swedish Presidency had invited the Director and the Member States to bring forward issues they wanted to be discussed at the meeting. Responses came from the Director, Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Poland and Belgium. We seize the opportunity to bring forward our appreciation of all of those contributing to the input for the discussions at the meeting. Even though, due to time constraints, we couldn\u2019t go into details on every issue. The outcome of the meeting was very positive, at least from the Presidency\u2019s point of view. It stated: We are playing for the same team. There are no hidden agendas. The Commission will whenever applicable allocate own resources to assist CEPOL in any issue as well as being a sounding board whenever applicable. CEPOL is a European Agency and we have to be in line with the procedures to be followed in the framework of the general budget of the EU and of Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities and the conditions of employment of other servants of the European Communities; period. The issue of a fusion between Europol and CEPOL follows the line of the response from Mr. Fabio Marini. It is a hypothesis in line with the ambitions of assisting smaller agencies to be able to match the rules and regulations when it comes to management and administrations in comparison with the rules and regulations. The network is not and will not be challenged. The location of CEPOL Secretariat is a premature issue. The Commission will promote a further development of exchange-programmes when it comes to policing, like the ERASMUS. Finally, the Commission brought forward its respect for all the good results CEPOL actually was delivering by its core products.

During a consultation the Working Group learned that CEPOL courses are not designed and documented (format, learning outcomes, assessment, lecturers, etc.) in a way that enable third parties to assess them and to award ECVETs (European system of accumulation (capitalisation) and transfer of credits designed for vocational education and training in Europe). CEPOL Secretariat cannot ask for an assessment of CEPOL activities; any assessments should be done in the country of the organising institute. This issue will be put forward during the 74/2009 Seminar on the Bologna Process which takes place 7-10 September 2009 in Slovenia. The Working Group, who will support the seminar, also discussed the programme. The needs to create a database of trainers was extensively discussed. Based on an assessment of advantages and risks and other provisions, the Working Group recommends: Not to introduce the trainers database at this stage; To freeze it until quality assurance in education becomes a topic within CEPOL e.g. under the influence and experiences in the Bologna or Bruges-Copenhagen process. The Working Group took note of the progress report, the product break-down and the risk log regarding the e-Learning modules on Europol, the Pr\u00fcm Treaty and Police English. Regarding the Learning Management System (LMS), the Working Group agreed on the proposed image of predefined functions (e.g. forum for participants to introduce themselves, to express their expectations, pre-course assignments, technical settings, etc.,) in order to ease the work of the course manager in relation to the system. The Revised Q-13 (volume I) refers to a second volume that should contain more practical and background information. The purpose is to bring all relevant CEPOL documents related to learning together. Topics are at this moment: Learning Strategies, e-Learning Strategies, Post-course Learning Reinforcement, Peer Review, Writing Objectives, Learning Styles, Evaluation, Recommendations for Course Managers, Recommendations for Trainers and Recommendations for Lecturers The next Working Group on Learning meeting will take place 9-10 September 2009 in Ljubljana, Slovenia", "url": "https://cepol.europa.eu/media/news/15th-working-group-learning-meeting"}, {"id": "CEPOL_NEWS_0587", "date": "2009-06-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Swedish Presidency \u2013 Introduction Letter", "text": " Dear Colleagues, It is with strong ambitions combined with a large portion of humbleness Sweden takes over the Chair of CEPOL\u2019s Governing Board and steps into the shoes of the Czech Republic. I assume the second semester of 2009 will be challenging for the avenue and course of CEPOL and its network. I would like to seize the opportunity to express appreciation to the Czech Republic for its efforts and measures to strengthen and develop CEPOL during its Presidency. The Swedish Presidency will work in a Troika set-up comprising Sweden, Czech Republic and Spain in order to establish optimum preconditions for continuity and sustainability. As soon as we have received the letter of resignation of the Director of CEPOL, envisaged 1 July 2009, we will immediately take the necessary actions to commence the recruitment process of a new Director in accordance with the Rules and Regulations. The ambition is that the 17th Governing Board meeting will decide on setting up a Selection Committee. The Committee will comprise five members, four from the Member States and one from the Commission. The assignment is to finalise the recruitment process and to prepare the Governing Board decision on the subject in matter. In order to speed up the process, we will approach the Member States as soon as possible with a draft of an advert of the vacant post for comments. We will come back to you with further information on the process and a timetable. Another urgent matter to be addressed is the five year evaluation of CEPOL in accordance with the Council Decision 681/2005/JHA, Article 21. Sweden will continue the preparatory work in cooperation with Spain, Belgium and Hungary in order to prepare basis for decisions to the 17th Governing Board meeting when it comes to procedures, terms of reference etc. Furthermore, the Swedish Presidency will take concrete actions to reinforce the image and reputation of CEPOL within the European Union and to strengthen the network as well as enhancing the capacity of the Governing Board as the only decision making body within CEPOL. We will perform our duties in close cooperation with the Chairs of the Committees and in tandem with the Director and the Secretariat. Focus will be kept on CEPOL\u2019s core business. We will welcome a closer cooperation with other European Union Institutions, and continuously keep them updated on our programmes and progress as well as invite them to lend us advice and assistance. When it comes to priorities, the Stockholm Programme will be a focal point. We will emphasise the paramount importance of considering the content whenever applicable in activities delivered by CEPOL. In addition, we will take initiatives and propose awareness seminars on the topic and the Programme will be one of the main threads at the Presidency seminar: \u201cCrime, Police and Justice in 21st Century\u201d, in December 2009, in Sweden. Furthermore, we will elucidate the background of Commission\u2019s opinion pertaining to the Europol/CEPOL-issue. Other focal areas will be police cooperation within the European Union, human rights issues, crime victim perspectives, crime prevention, trafficking in human beings, sexual exploitation of children, exchange of information and forensics. It could be worthwhile mentioning, that the Swedish Presidency in an overall perspective will work for a Strategy regarding exchange of information within the European Union, an Action Oriented Paper (AOP) regarding Trafficking in Human Beings and accreditation of forensic laboratories when it comes to DNA and fingerprints. In addition, the Swedish Minister of Justice, Ms. Beatrice Ask, has declared an intention to summon a Minister meeting during the Swedish Presidency on the topic of enhanced police cooperation. It could be foreseen that at least some of these efforts could lead to needs and demands of training and education activities, which preferably should be provided by CEPOL. The Director of CEPOL, Mr. Ulf G\u00f6ransson, has in a letter to IAS (Mr. Deffaa), 31 May 2009, clearly declared his intention to report a \u201cclean table\u201d to the CEPOL Governing Board meeting in December 2009 regarding all IAS observations. The Swedish Presidency will whenever applicable strongly support the Director and his staff in these efforts. Finally, I am really looking forward to working together with you during the next coming six months as the Chair of the Governing Board in a mood of good spirit, interdependence and a mutual understanding of our common goals and shared vision of where we are heading. If you have any questions, ideas or proposals, which are under the competency of the Presidency, don\u2019t hesitate to contact the Swedish Presidency CEPOL team. I am looking forward to seeing you in Sweden soon.

Emile Perez opened the meeting, saying: \u201cCEPOL is the most extraordinary training network - involving many people within each Member State, Associated country, partner agencies and the Secretariat. CEPOL has the support of all institutes responsible for police training in the Member States. This network is the most tightly knit in the field of training. It is the pivot of European and international cooperation in areas of security and police issues. It is also an illustration of the quality of work that has bought together police officers in the broadest sense of the word. The renewed intent of the French Presidency is that CEPOL is the cornerstone at European and international level in the field of training.\u201d Among the main financial topics discussed were the Final Accounts 2007, Half Year Results and Forecast for 2008, Court of Auditors Preliminary Observations and the Director\u2019s Response.

The e-Library serves as one place for all knowledge documents and replaces the previous separate CEPOL-eDoc and EPKN systems. Users previously registered on the CEPOL-eDoc and EPKN systems will need to re-register on the new e-Net system. This can be done by visiting www.cepol.europa.eu and clicking on \u2018register/login\u2019 at the top of the page. Users will have to be approved before they can gain access to the system. Registered users on the new e-Net system have the advantage of accessing a range of complementary systems via single sign-on, including a restricted website, Discussion Forum, Live Chat facility and e-Library. The third phase of e-Net will include e-Learning (Learning Management System) and Workspace (Document Management System). Registered e-Net users will be able to access the information available in the e-Library, but the moderating and submitting functionalities available in the previous system will be implemented at a later stage, once the Governing Board have agreed on a new registration and architecture policy. It is hoped that the system will be fully operational in October 2008. The previous CEPOL-eDoc system will be available to \u2018read only\u2019 until 31 August 2008.

The course was organised by the Police College of Finland together with the Swedish National Police Academy; and supported by Iceland, Europol and Eurojust. Attended by 17 participants from 13 European countries and four experts from Sweden, Europol and Eurojust, the aim of the course was to increase the awareness and understanding of what is needed in the fight against Organised Crime, and in particular of how the OCTA Reports can be used for strategic planning in this context. Furthermore, the course aimed at translating strategic priorities in the area of Organised Crime into detailed educational and training recommendations. Presentations were given about Organised Crime, the OCTA Report and Eurojust. The outcome will be a Trainers\u2019 Manual on this topic put together by the participants of this course and based on the model of CEPOL\u2019s Common Curricula. The Manual should then be published as a booklet and/or on the CEPOL website. The participants worked with a strong commitment. In between the two courses, the participants will work on assignments to prepare the second step. They will do this in groups while using CEPOL\u2019s e-Net facilities. Dermott Nelhams, from the Metropolitan Police Service in the UK, found the format and content of this course to be both unique and informative. He said: \u201dThe speakers and facilitators were professional and organised, thereby maximising the learning and informed participation of the delegates in 'syndicate' work. This rolling programme is designed to enable officers from the EU Member States to work together in producing a current and relevant training guide to assist in the fight against Organised Crime throughout the EU and for this reason alone it is a valid and worthwhile exercise.\u201d Carlos Costa from the ISPJCJ, Portugal said: \u201cThe course showed that there is a great need for establishing harmonised methods of training in different EU countries in order to improve the ways of combating of organised crime.\u201d Ingrid Werkman, a Senior Police Officer from the Hessische Police School, Germany, stated: 'It was my first CEPOL course and meeting people from all over Europe who share the same interests was a great experience! Discussing the situation of Organised Crime and finding out that the phenomenon and the problems in combating it are nearly the same in the participating Member States, taught me that it is imperative to get a common basis of knowledge and comprehension which should be implemented in the education and training. Curriculum standards have to be created and this is why the course was very useful. This is a good step on the way to harmonisation of the police work in Europe in fighting Organised Crime. European strategic developments in fighting against Organised Crime (OCTA) can help to convince those responsible about the future crime trends and help them to assign priorities.'

The Governing Board welcomed the draft Staff Policy Plan 2009-2011, which includes three new functions in 2009: Internal Control Standards Coordinator (AD5); Quality Manager (AD5); and Programme Support Officer (AD5). After the European Commission has given their opinion on the document, it will be tabled to the Governing Board for adoption. A report on the CEPOL Network Working Conference held in Luxembourg in October 2007 was tabled which states a strategic plan for the next five years should be developed. Related to this, the Governing Board adopted the decision \u2018Laying down CEPOL\u2019s Mission and Vision\u2019. CEPOL\u2019s mission is: \u2018Contributing to European Police Cooperation through Learning\u2019. CEPOL\u2019s vision is: \u2018CEPOL is acknowledged by allied agencies and authorities in the policing and academic world to be the primary source of learning and development in the field of education and training for better cooperation and policing in Europe.\u2019 The Chair invited members of the Governing Board to complete a questionnaire in order to prioritise CEPOL\u2019s strategy. \u201cDeveloping clearer definitions of the roles, functions and remits of all network elements\u201d was highlighted as CEPOL\u2019s highest priority. The Director presented the preliminary Annual Accounts 2007 and the Governing Board adopted a decision to carry over budget appropriations from 2007 to 2008. The Governing Board adopted the Implementing Rules to the Financial Regulation and invited the Director to provide a proposal for a chapter on Internal Auditing to the next Budget and Administration Committee meeting. A status report was given on the implementation of the Exchange Programme and the Euromed Police II project. The current CEPOL/Agis Exchange Programme finishes at the end of 2008. e-Net, the new electronic platform currently in development, was discussed and the Governing Board was informed that the website, discussion forum and chat will be the first parts to be rolled out into production during March 2008. The e-Library and e-Learning parts will follow later this year. Other key items discussed at the Governing Board included: A report of the 2007 Activities was presented by CEPOL Secretariat; The Meetings Calendar for the second half of 2008 was adopted (please refer to the \u2018Calendar of Events\u2019 on the website for more information); A report by ACTA (Working Group \u201cAnalysis of CEPOL\u2019s Training Activities\u201d) highlighting recommendations and proposals for further consideration; Cooperation Agreements - in particular cooperation with Russia; A proposal to establish a Project Group \u201cSurvey on European Police Education (SEPE)\u201d was adopted; The new members of the Research and Science Working Group were approved as Lesley Duff (United Kingdom) and Raimundas Kalesnykas (Lithuania); The new Members for Electronic Network Working Group were approved as John Mc Hale (Ireland) and Alexandros Anastasiadis (Greece). The 12th CEPOL Governing Board meeting will be held in Bled, Slovenia on Tuesday 20 May and Wednesday 21 May 2008.", "url": "https://cepol.europa.eu/media/news/11th-governing-board-meeting-takes-place-slovenia"}, {"id": "CEPOL_NEWS_0635", "date": "2008-03-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "First Phase of CEPOL e-Net Launched", "text": "During the Governing Board meeting in February 2008 in Slovenia, the Secretariat informed the Board about the implementation of the new Electronic Network. It was announced that the first phase of the new e-Net would be launched before 1 April 2008 and CEPOL is pleased to announce that the first phase was launched into production today, Friday 14 March 2008 \u2013 visit: www.cepol.europa.eu . The aim of the new electronic platform is to bring all existing systems (CEPOL-eDoc, EPDN, EPKN, EPSN and the website) together under one \u2018roof\u2019 and allow users access to all systems by entering one username and password. The system allows users to be given certain permissions to access the areas relevant to their CEPOL work. The launch of the first phase includes the migration of the previous website to a Content Management System (CMS), a new Discussion Forum and a \u2018Live Chat\u2019 Facility. Two further phases - to include the e-Library (CEPOL-eDoc replacement) and e-Learning as well as a Workspace (Document Management System), will be launched later. The system is currently being developed by an Italian company, JAM Sistemi, who won the electronic platform tender last year and has been extensively tested by users from CEPOL\u2019s Working Groups and the e-Net Reference Group. To access e-Net please visit: www.cepol.europa.eu where users will see the public website. In order to access the other areas of e-Net \u2013 restricted website, Discussion Forum and Live Chat - users will need to log-in at: http://www.cepol.europa.eu/index.php?id=register-login . Users already registered in the previous website can access e-Net, using the same username as before but should note that they will need to use a generic password: cepol++ to access the system for the first time. Once logged-in, users are asked to update their personal data and choose a new password. For security reasons, users who have not updated their passwords by Friday 28 March 2008 will be disabled. New users wishing to gain access to e-Net should register via the website at: http://www.cepol.europa.eu/index.php?id=register-login . Once approved, users will receive an email notification. Any users experiencing problems should email: > . Visitors to the website may notice some minor changes due to the migration to a Content Management System (CMS) but the overall design and layout has been kept as close as possible to the previous website. The CMS provides a range of functionalities not available in the previous systems, including news by topic, an RSS feed for news and categorisation of courses, for example. Four key topics have been developed for the general Discussion Forum. Users are encouraged to use the Forum to share best practice and information. All registered users can then view and partake in the general discussions but if topics are missing, users are welcome to make suggestions for new topics by emailing: > . There will also be dedicated \u2018closed areas\u2019 developed in the Discussion Forum for Committees, Working Groups and Sub-groups. The \u2018Live Chat\u2019 facility allows users to informally chat with other users online in real-time. It is an additional feature to the\u00a0Discussion Forum to be used when users want to have a computer-meeting on a specific topic, for example. It is also possible to arrange a \u2018Live Chat\u2019 in advance with a specific group of people. Ulf G\u00f6ransson, CEPOL Director, said: \u201cLaunching the first phase of e-Net is a big step forward in bringing the different CEPOL systems together under one roof to simplify networking for users in the CEPOL environment.

The former email addresses will continue to work for a short time, but please ensure you change your address books as soon as possible. Similarly, using the former website address will work for a short time as redirections are in place, however, please ensure you save the new address in your bookmarks and favourites as soon as possible. The aim of the new website is to make more information about CEPOL easily accessible and make the website more user-friendly. The new domain name brings CEPOL inline with other European Union (EU) agencies, as does the new email addresses for CEPOL Secretariat staff. The website has had a complete redesign, both in terms of look and content: A 'News Section' to publicise the good work that is going on in and around the network; An 'About CEPOL' section with details of how the agency is set-up and organised; A new 'Calendar of Events' section, where activities have been organised into 'Meetings', 'Courses & Seminars', 'Conferences' and other 'Related Events'; A section devoted to 'Training and Learning'; A comprehensive section devoted to 'Research and Development'; A 'Useful Links' section to allow easy access to other websites relevant to CEPOL's work. There is also a new secure log-in area, allowing those in the network to access the contact details of colleagues and more detailed information about particular activities going on in the community. Those wishing to have access to the secure area, required to register on the website (click Register/Login). To complete the new look website, the words 'European Police College' have been added beneath the CEPOL logo oval. The revised logo will ensure that CEPOL is presented in a consistent way visually in future, incorporating both the abbreviation and the full name. The combination should be easier to use and also more easily identifiable to a wide-range of audiences, which will help reinforce CEPOL's image.

Hosted by the Deutsche Hochschule der Polizei, this year's event is a working conference to present and debate the subject 'European Approach to Police Science'. Academic skills and scientific knowledge are playing an increasing role in many police forces and training institutes in EU Member States. To reflect this, CEPOL established a temporary project group in 2005, called 'European Approach to Police Science'. A group of six European experts were tasked to explore the topic in light of increased demands for police cooperation across Europe and beyond. The Project Group will present the findings at the forthcoming CEPOL Research and Science Conference in September. Senior police officers, police trainers and police scientists are invited to share the insights and to join the debate to discuss the outcomes with distinguished scholars such as: Max Peter Ratzel (Director of Europol); Prof. Jean-Paul Brodeur (University of Montreal); and Prof. Thomas Feltes (University of Bochum). One objective of the conference is to widen the debate about a European Approach to Police Science and find ways to develop a common strategy for the future. Among the questions to be considered at the conference are: Is there a common European understanding of police, policing, police philosophy and the role of police in the society? Is there a common European understanding and definition of police science? Is there a way for better integration of police science and police practice? What common main research fields from a comparative point of view can be identified? What are the main values, methodologies and standards of European Police Science in the future?

The aim of the Project Group was to obtain a common understanding of Police Science and Research. The project group was asked to find answers to the following questions: Is there a common European understanding of police, policing, police philosophy and the role of police in the society? If yes, how can it be defined? If no, are there still some common elements? Is there a common understanding and definition of police science? How can the interplay between police science and police related research be described? Can common key questions be identified? Are those which cannot be \"solved\" immediately essential for policing and must they be discussed on a continuous basis? Is there a European way of assembling contributions from policing, law and social sciences? Is there a way for better integration of police science and police practice? Or does it make no longer sense to distinguish between theory and practice? Should we rather speak of solving practical problems on the management level in a theoretical and scientific way? How can European police science results be integrated into training courses and education for Senior Police Officers? How can the interplay - in the past and in the future - be described between police training and the academic world? What does \"professionalism\" in the field of police management (knowledge, skills, ethics and methods) mean? Which common main research areas can be identified from a comparative point of view? What will be the principle values, methodologies and standards of European police science in the future? Six police experts from different backgrounds (law, social anthropology, psychology, political science, sociology and criminology) made-up the project group: - Hans-Gerd Jaschke (Germany) - Francisco del Barrio Romero (Spain) - Tore Bj\u00f8rgo (Norway) - Cees Kwanten (Netherlands) - Rob Mawby (United Kingdom) - Milan Pagon (Slovenia) The experts come from different countries nominated by the national Police Academies of EU Member States and selected by CEPOL. The Final Report The study is divided into six chapters in order to try and give answers to the previous set of questions aforementioned: Chapter 1: History of Police Science Chapter 2: Core Topics and Discourses of Police Science Chapter 3: Police Science - A Philosophy of Science Approach Chapter 4: From Police Science to the Science of Policing Chapter 5: Police Science, Police Education and Police Training Chapter 6: A European Approach to Police Science Apart from these chapters, the report includes a preface, an introduction, references, and index of key terms and a brief description of the authors. The opening chapter draws the historical lines of Police and Police studies. It is a relation full of tensions; of common approaches on the one hand and mistrust and rejection on the other. Police Science as a process cannot be understood without consideration of police and science in recent decades. When discussing this issue we had to note, that Police Science cannot be an invention that has to be decided by whomever. It is involved in patterns of interests on both sides: the one of the police and the one of the academics. The next points of interest were the objectives of Police Science. A discipline consists of key questions, research interests, methods and objectives. The chapter on the core issues gives a picture of these objectives, and it makes clear that there are many overlaps with other disciplines like criminology. However, this is not a specific feature, because most academic disciplines have a lot of such overlaps. When we talk about Police Science as an 'applied science', we can see that applying means not only to take over methods from other disciplines, but covering topics from several disciplines related to policing. After a first agreement about the objectives of Police Science, the relationships to other sciences and disciplines had to be clarified. We identified different types of knowledge within policing like experience-based knowledge and police science-driven knowledge. These discussions came up again and again: What is science; what is a discipline; how can relationships and overlaps be described? There was a danger to go to deep into the field of theories of science, science history and methodological questions. Ultimately we found a more pragmatic understanding of Police Science. During the discussions we recognised, that modern policing is more than what police do. In modern societies many policing-related tasks of controlling crime and disorder are done by the community, by private organisations and cross-institutional networks. So, how can we deal with Police Science or: what about the science of policing? Indeed, there are many arguments for an expansion of Police Science to a Science of Policing in the future. Police Science in the future should be established as a discipline in the context of other academic disciplines. But it must not be forgotten that Police Science is connected to police education and training. The next chapter deals with the following question: What is the contribution of Police Science to police training and education? Some of us distinguish between police training at Police Academies and police education at universities and ask for the tensions between both and the impact and the role of Police Science. Finally, due to the international approach, we had to consider the European perspective. Of course, all academic disciplines are international and do not have national borders and limitations, but in spite of this we had to face different developments in the EU countries. This was a background for asking for a European perspective, for common interests and values, and for different ones. With regard to this, a comparative point of view is needed and can be an important foundation of a modern Police Science. Recommendations for the Future The recommendations of the final report can be divided into two categories, general recommendations and specific recommendations. General Recommendations: To promote a continuous discussion within Police Science in Europe on the following general topics in order to ensure best research and knowledge: the main tendencies in the development of societies, crime and policing, mission of the police, purpose of policing, European ways of problem-solutions, differences, commonalities and obstacles. Specific Recommendations: To disseminate research-based knowledge in training context; To involve and support CEPOL's working Groups and sub-groups in context proposals concerning the structure and direction of further discussions and the further development of a European approach to police science; To develop a European Police Science and Research Journal; To carry out empirical studies which can be useful in CEPOL training context; To promote the integration of police science and research outcomes in CEPOL courses and in national training programmes; Initiatives for new activities in order to solve open questions.

The CEPOL/Agis Exchange Programme aims to help improve cross-border police co-operation and understanding of different police cultures across Europe. Open to Senior Police Officers and Police Tutors in Europe, it also aims to provide individuals with an opportunity to get to know colleagues and working methods in other countries. There will be two exchange periods for the exchangees during this year. Senior Police Officers can choose for exchange periods of ten days or three weeks, while Police Tutors can choose for exchange periods between one and three months. In order to focus on important issues in the fights against cross-border crime, Senior Police Officers could choose from three different topics: Trafficking in Human Beings; Child Abuse on the Internet; or Diversity and Radicalisation. The topic for Police Tutors is 'Learning Environment'. The CEPOL/Agis Exchange Programme began in December 2006 and will run for a period of two years, ending in November 2008. The participating countries in this year's exchange programme include: Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom. It is hoped that next year, a further five countries will also get involved in the exchange programme.

This year\u2019s conference was hosted by the Deutsche Hochschule der Polizei (German Police University) and focussed on the issues surrounding the Project Group on a \u2018European Approach to Police Science\u2019 report \u2018Perspectives of Police Science in Europe\u2019 published earlier this year. As with all the Research and Science conferences, the emphasis was very much on the exchange of ideas and networking, but the aim of the conference was to debate the report and find ways to develop a common understanding and a basis for future research and science activities. Key areas of debate included: Is there a common European understanding of police, policing, police philosophy and the role of police in society? Is there a common European understanding and definition of police science? Is there a way for better integration of police science and police practice? What common main research fields from a comparative point of view can be identified? What are the main values, methodologies and standards of European Police Science in the future? The main conclusion from the conference was that at a European level, there is clearly a need in modern policing for good police science and research. The question remains, however, how to integrate scientific insights and practical approaches in police training and operations. A total of 75 participants, all with background in adult education, took part in the conference, including police scientists, senior police officers and police trainers. Norbert Reez, a Police Director from Germany, said: \u201cWe need more of such conferences. This conference has shown how important it is to build up a network involving police practitioners and scientists, and also that a change of cultures is necessary in order to enable both sides to work together.\u201d Professor Jaroslav Holomek, Bratislava School of Law and Alexander Dubcek University in Trencin, Slovakia, said: \u201cFrom here we should continue the discussion on police science and what it is; a working group should develop a few models which then should be discussed in the next conference in order to find an agreement on a model for police science.

The Exchange Programme aims to help improve cross-border police cooperation and understanding of different systems, structures, working methods and police cultures across Europe. Open to senior police officers and police training staff in Europe, it also aims to provide individuals with an opportunity to get to know colleagues and operational day-to-day working methods in other countries. The conferences overlapped so that exchangees taking part in the 2008 programme could meet last year\u2019s Exchangees and Tutors and learn about their experiences. It also provided last year\u2019s exchangees with the opportunity to strengthen the professional networks they had created, reflect on their experiences and give feedback on how the programme could be improved in the future. In 2007, 77 participants (51 Exchangees and 49 Tutors - 23 with double status) from 20 countries took part in the programme. The participants summarised the main benefits of taking part in the Exchange Programme as: a great learning experience; making new personal contacts; knowing who to contact in another country about key topics; gaining greater understanding of different approaches to policing and police training; and improving cross-border cooperation. The overwhelming message from those who partook in the 2007 Exchange Programme was that it was an extremely valuable experience and should continue after the project finishes at the end of 2008. Bogus?aw Jaremczak, from Poland who was an Exchangee in Slovenia and Sweden, said: \u201cThe Exchange Programme is an opportunity to gain knowledge and share experiences as well as to improve the understanding of police work in European dimension.\u201d Pekka H\u00f6\u00f6k, from Finland who was a Tutor and received Exchangees from Portugal, United Kingdom and Slovenia added: \u201cThe idea of this programme is excellent. Even if we don\u2019t find a new knowledge, we establish cooperation with new colleagues and build trust.\u201d In 2008, 86 participants from 21 countries will take part in the Exchange Programme, 56 Exchangees and 55 Tutors (25 of them with double status). The Initial Conference provided participants with a forum to meet their tutors, discuss hosting plans, learn about the project administrative procedures as well as learn from previous participants\u2019 experiences. In her closing speech, Nevenka Tomovic, Chair of the CEPOL Governing Board, Slovene Presidency, said: \u201cGreater mobility of operational staff, trainers, students and researchers in the area of policing will contribute to better cooperation among police forces in the EU. This project represents precisely the free movement of persons and knowledge.\u201d The CEPOL/Agis Exchange Programme began in December 2006 and will run for a period of two years, ending in November 2008.

It was announced that the CEPOL/Europol Cooperation Agreement had been signed in The Hague on 19 October 2007. The Governing Board mandated the Director of CEPOL to start negotiations for Cooperation Agreements with Frontex and Eurojust, as well as develop a closer relationship in training related matters with OLAF. Ulf G\u00f6ransson, CEPOL Director, provided a status report about the development of CEPOL\u2019s Electronic Platform (e-Net). He reported that two meetings had been held with the company that was awarded the tender and work is underway. A new e-Net Reference Group, made of Working Group representatives, will hold a meeting to discuss user requirements for e-Net following the Governing Board meeting. A status report on the Euromed Police II project, given by Project Manager Pierre Antonmattei, outlined the need for Member States to help in organising and hosting some of the planned courses and study visits for the project. Member States offered their services and facilities. Three documents presented by the Training and Research Committee (TRC) were adopted: Peer Review, Post Course Learning Reinforcement and a revised version of Quality in Thirteen Questions (Q13). The \u2018Peer Review\u2019 paper recommends an informal, voluntary approach be taken in applying forms of reviewing and appraisal.

The revised Q13 aims to apply Q13 standards for the initiation, design, implementation and evaluation phases of CEPOL\u2019s learning activities. The Governing Board adopted the members to the three new Common Curricula Sub-groups, Civilian Crisis Management, Drug Trafficking and Management of Diversity. Two decisions \u2018Concerning the Supply of the Services of Module Advisors\u2019 were adopted by the Board. Module Advisers will be allowed to either deliver their service through a service contract with national police training institutes or as Seconded National Experts at CEPOL Secretariat. A Project Group on e-Learning was established. The new Project Group will develop an e-learning system for CEPOL courses and seminars. Laurent Vidal (France) was approved by the Governing Board as the Deputy Chair of the Research and Science Working Group. Janos Fehervary gave an interim report on the outcomes of the CEPOL Network Working Conference held in Luxembourg in October. The Governing Board will receive the written report, once it has been approved by the Strategy Committee. The 10th CEPOL Governing Board meeting is the last to be held under the Portuguese Presidency. The 11th CEPOL Governing Board meeting, will be held in Ljubljana, Slovenia under the new Slovenian Presidency on Tuesday 19 and Wednesday 20 February 2008.

The aim of the visit was to increase awareness and understanding of the roles and responsibilities on both sides. 'This was a good opportunity to prepare for the CEPOL Presidency in the first half of 2008 and to meet the really enthusiastic and committed staff of the CEPOL Secretariat,' said Mrs Nevenka Tomovic. She added: 'Three years ago I never expected such a challenge to lie ahead for Slovenia or myself but I am really looking forward to it.' Topics covered during the two day visit included: information concerning the Governing Board and the two Committees Slovenia will chair (Strategy Committee and the Budget and Administration Committee), as well as the responsibilities of the other Committees, current and future issues of the Working Groups, Sub-groups and Project Groups.

Ulf G\u00f6ransson, Director of CEPOL, said: 'I always appreciate having the incoming Presidencies visit CEPOL Secretariat as early as possible. This is a chance for the incoming Presidency to be informed in more details about all fields of work at the Secretariat and vice versa for the staff of CEPOL Secretariat to learn about the Presidencies' priorities.

Organised by the Cyprus Police Academy, the seminar was supported by Portugal and Slovakia and built on the first CEPOL seminar of this kind held in France last year. Figures associated with traffic accidents are staggering. More than 40,000 people lose their lives on roads in the European Union every year, while a further 1.7 million are seriously injured or become disabled. Figures further show that traffic accidents are the main reason of deaths for people under the age of 45. The social, as well as economic, impact of these very high figures on Member States is enormous. The estimated annual cost is over 160 billion euro, an amount equal to 2% of the European Union\u2019s Gross Domestic Product. Based on these figures, in 2001 the European Union set itself the goal of reducing the number of traffic accidents by 50% by the year 2010. Forty-four participants from 19 countries took part in the seminar. Speakers from Cyprus, Portugal, Slovakia and the United Kingdom presented the following topics: The EU and CEPOL - Georgia Pelagia (Head of Cyprus CEPOL Team); The Traffic Situation in Cyprus - Demetris Demetriou (Cyprus Police Superintendent); Transport & Road Safety-Situation in Cyprus - George Morphakis (Cyprus Ministry of Communication and Works); Traffic Police Activities - Mr. Lubomir Durina (Slovakia); Apple & Lemon Project \u2013A special Police Operation - Lubomir Durina (Slovakia); Results of Research of Young Drivers Involved in Road Traffic Accidents - Dr. Anthi Loutsiou (University of Cyprus); Road Safety in the EU - Alexandrer Von Campenhausen (European Commission, DGTREN); Activities and the Road Safety Performance Index (PIN) - Daniel Ugarte (European Transport Safety Council); Casualty Reduction Across Merseyside - Andrew Shakeshaft (Merseyside Police Superintendent) and David Higginbotham (Merseyside Road Safety Partnership, UK); TISPOL Activities Preview - Charis Evripidou (Cyprus Police Inspector). During his closing speech, Michael Papageorgiou, Deputy Chief of the Cyprus Police, said: \u201cOver the last four days, it has become apparent that all the Member States participating in this seminar face similar problems regarding road safety. The serious problem involving large numbers of young people in road traffic accidents is an example, and there is agreement that more effective measures need to be employed with regards to this age group. One possible measure that was suggested is to extend the period of training before young drivers qualify for a driving license\u201d.

The aim of the conference was to allow participants to consider CEPOL's network function and collate proposals and recommendations for strengthening the network in the future. A report summarising the outcomes of the conference will be presented to the Strategy Committee and CEPOL Governing Board for consideration. Since CEPOL was established as an agency of the European Union, the continuing importance of functioning as a network has been central to the organisation. The functioning of the network was discussed during two CEPOL Governing Board meetings in 2006, and a draft policy paper on possible improvements debated. The conference built on these previous discussions. Participants were divided into five working groups to carry out a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats), to discuss a possible 'vision' for CEPOL in five years time and to consider the following questions: How can the network ensure that knowledge is shared between individual countries and Member States? How can we strengthen understanding of the roles and their functions, within CEPOL's network? Member States are the network\u00a0- how can levels of commitment be improved and maintained? How can we improve the information system of our network? How can the network ensure the commitment and continued work of Committees and Working Groups? The working groups provided participants with a forum to brainstorm, develop new ideas as well as suggest possible solutions to issues. Many similar ideas come from the different groups. Janos Fehervary, Austria, who concluded the plenary on the final day, said: 'The results of the SWOT and vision sessions should form the basis of a strategic plan for the network. It has been a good conference and my proposal is to not stop here working together for the network\u00a0- this should be one of the starting points\u00a0- let us continue. There are several key ideas that have come out of the working groups - not least a need to strengthen the network through clear roles and responsibilities, improve efficiency, be more effective and proactive.' Ulf G\u00f6ransson, Director, added: 'This conference has essentially been about considering CEPOL's 'next step' since becoming an agency of the EU. We have a new structure, new finances, new organisation and I promise you we will refer to the ideas generated in this conference for the next few years as we did in the 'Italian-Swedish conferences' when CEPOL was originally set-up. The next steps are to develop a general business plan, communications strategy, define Governing Board working methods and define the different roles in the network.' A total of 59 participants took part from 23 Member States, the Portuguese Presidency, CEPOL Secretariat and conference organisers. The event was very well organised by Luxembourg on behalf of the network.", "url": "https://cepol.europa.eu/media/news/new-vision-cepol"}]
