Kasia worked as a seconded national expert in EIGE\u2019s gender-based violence programme from November 2018 to November 2020. She was a brilliant mind, a tireless champion of women\u2019s rights, and a warm and open person who took the time to get to know everyone she worked with. \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adKasia came to EIGE from the Polish government, where she was the chief expert on fundamental rights. A lawyer by training, she believed in the power of legal texts to improve people\u2019s lives. In her work for EIGE, Kasia always made sure to highlight how much victims of gender-based violence would benefit from proper implementation of laws such as the EU Victims\u2019 Rights Directive. This practical approach enabled her to come up with solid policy proposals to help EU countries better protect women. Being practical did not stop Kasia being ambitious. She had high expectations of herself, and of the organisations she worked for. She was not afraid to make suggestions for how we could increase the impact of our research, and showed us how we could expect more of ourselves. Firm but diplomatic, personable but professional, she was a born leader who inspired those around her. \u00a0 The same passion she had for her work, she had for life after the office shut its doors. She was committed to weekly quiz nights with her colleagues, to hosting joyful dinners, and to baking cakes. She had a wicked sense of humour and an infectious laugh that lightened the mood on even the most difficult of days. We will miss her terribly.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Our thoughts are with Kasia\u2019s family and her many friends.", "url": "https://eige.europa.eu/news/remembering-katarzyna-wolska-wrona"}, {"id": "EIGE_NEWS_0002", "date": "2021-07-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU research shows COVID-19 poised to end progress on gender equality", "text": "The social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis threaten to roll back recent progress in gender equality, including an overall trend of upward convergence. Despite slow progress in some areas over the past decade, crucial improvements had been made in countries with lower levels of gender equality. The regressive consequences of COVID-19 on gender equality, as well as haphazard implementation of policy measures demonstrated to improve levels of gender equality, are detailed in the new policy brief Upward convergence in gender equality: How close is the Union of equality?, a joint research output from Eurofound and the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). The policy brief investigates convergence patterns in gender equality as measured by EIGE\u2019s Gender Equality Index among Member States over the period 2010\u20132018. It looks at gender equality in the EU in six core domains: work, money, knowledge, time, power and health. It finds that it was achievements in the domain of power that drove the overall progress in gender equality between 2010 and 2018. This domain covers the representation of women and men in a range of the highest decision-making positions across the political, economic and social spheres, with striking improvements in gender balance on company boards in several Member States (notably France, Italy, Belgium and Germany) acting as a major driving point. At national level, Sweden ranked first in advancing gender equality throughout the entire period, while Greece struggled the most. Several Mediterranean Member States and some of the Baltic Member States were among those catching up most with the EU average. In Italy, Cyprus, Malta and Portugal, the Index increased by more than 7.5 points. Among the Baltic Member States, Estonia recorded the most impressive rise \u2013 7.3 points. Progress among central and eastern Member States was less encouraging, with several countries in this region improving their performance at a slower pace than the EU average. Czechia, Hungary and Poland, for example, were virtually in the same position in 2018 as eight years earlier.\u00a0 Speaking on the publication of the joint policy brief, Carlien Scheele, Director of EIGE, spoke about the need to progress gender equality beyond the workplace: 'COVID-19 has put gender equality at a crossroads, with measures to contain the pandemic taking a heavy and disproportionate toll on women\u2019s employment and increasing the time required for caring responsibilities. In rebuilding after the pandemic, it will be crucial to ensure that recovery measures are gender-sensitive and that greater equality is achieved in both paid and unpaid work. Workers in the care sector, who are mostly women and proved vital for our survival during the pandemic, deserve better pay and working conditions. Improving the conditions and status of care work could also attract more men to these jobs, which are critical for the future of Europe, especially in light of Europe\u2019s ageing population.\u2019 \u00a0\u00a0 Ivailo Kalfin, Eurofound Executive Director, emphasised that the economic shocks created by COVID-19 are likely to derail labour market progress on gender equality, and contribute to future disparities: 'Gender segregation in the labour market has left women disproportionately exposed to the economic turmoil created by COVID-19. It is necessary to take action to promote participation of women in male-dominated fields such as STEM and ICT, as well as to bring more men into female-dominated areas, such as the education and care sectors - not just that labour market impacts are shouldered more evenly, but also to benefit from the economic dynamism and potential that this can create.\u2019 For media enquiries, please contact Veronica Collins, +370 5 2157 449,\u00a0veronica.collins@eige.europa.eu Further information: Policy Brief: Upward convergence in gender equality: How close is the Union of equality?

Violence against women makes up 79 % of this cost, amounting to \u20ac289 billion. Human life, pain and suffering do not have a price. However, knowing the cost of violence can help EU countries channel money to where it\u2019s really needed -- and where it\u2019s most cost-effective. The money spent on supporting victims is not enough, with services such as shelters making up just 0.4 % of the cost of gender-based violence. EU countries need to invest more in activities that prevent violence against women and protect victims -- this is both a moral imperative, as well as savvy economics,\u201d said Carlien Scheele, EIGE\u2019s Director. EIGE\u2019s new study breaks down the different costs of gender-based violence, with the biggest cost coming from physical and emotional impact (56 %), followed by criminal justice services (21 %) and lost economic output (14 %). Other costs can include civil justice services (for divorces and child custody proceedings for example), housing aid and child protection. EIGE has calculated the cost of gender-based violence in the EU and in each Member State based on extrapolated data from the United Kingdom. This links the cost of gender-based violence in each EU Member State directly to its population size. As EIGE\u2019s study includes a review of existing methodologies to calculate the cost of gender-based violence, EU Member States can use this as a building block to design their own domestic cost estimations. To ensure an accurate calculation of the cost of gender-based violence, EU countries need detailed data from public services such as law enforcement and the justice sector. Because gender-based violence is under-reported, countries also need survey data to get a true idea of the number of victims. Collecting detailed data on different forms of gender-based violence is an obligation under the Istanbul Convention, which all EU countries have signed and 21 have ratified. The study will be published in September 2021.

Intimate partner violence against women makes up 87 % of this sum (\u20ac151 billion). EIGE has used data from the United Kingdom on which to base the extrapolation due to high availability of data and cost-benefit methodologies.

On 28 October 2021, EIGE will reveal the results of its Gender Equality Index during an online conference. This year, the topic of health is high on our agenda. We are taking a close look at how gender affects health and access to health services. Our focus is on mental health and sexual and reproductive health. We will also examine the different consequences of the coronavirus pandemic on women and men. Our Index will answer important questions, such as how access to sexual and reproductive health services changed during the pandemic. We will also look at how lockdowns and restrictions affected people\u2019s mental health in different ways. How common was burn out among parents combining paid work, online home-schooling and household chores? What about loneliness due to confinement measures for single women and men? We will explore these issues and provide recommendations on ways to prevent and overcome gender and health-related challenges during and after the pandemic. As always, we will have new scores for gender equality in the EU and all Member States. You will see if your country has improved its ranking or dropped down a notch. Discover which countries are speeding up progress and which ones are slowing down. Keep an eye on our website and follow #EIGEIndex on our social media channels for more updates. The conference will be an online event and live streamed from our website. Background information The Gender Equality Index is an important policy-making tool to measure the progress of gender equality in the EU over time. Each year, it gives the EU and the Member States a score from 1 to 100. A score of 100 would mean that a country had reached full equality between women and men. The scores are based on the gaps between women and men and levels of achievement in six core domains: work, money, knowledge, time, power and health, and their sub-domains. The Index also has two additional domains: violence against women and intersecting inequalities. The Index gives visibility to areas that need improvement and supports policy makers to design more effective gender equality measures.

Key findings in politics National parliaments: Gender balance by 2032? In November 2020, women made up 32.7 % of national parliaments in the EU. This covers a wide spectrum, from 49.6 % in Sweden to 12.6 % in Hungary. Five countries have gender-balanced parliaments, with at least 40 % of seats held by women: Belgium, Spain, France, Finland and Sweden. Women\u2019s representation in national parliaments is improving at a steady pace. The current proportion has gone up by 0.6 percentage points (pp) over the course of a year, and by 10.2 pp since 2004.\u00a0 If women\u2019s representation in national parliaments continues to improve at the current rate, we will have gender balance by 2032.\u00a0 \u00a0Proportion of women members of parliament grows three times faster in countries with quotas 11 Member States have legislative gender quotas for parliamentary elections. These countries have increased the share of women in their parliaments almost three times faster than countries without quotas. The proportion of women in parliaments increased more quickly in Ireland, Spain, Luxembourg, Poland and Slovenia after they adopted quotas. However, the Greek parliament saw little change in the share of women after raising their existing quota in 2019.\u00a0 Big variations in women\u2019s political representation among IPA beneficiaries In May 2020, women made up 27 % of parliamentarians in the IPA beneficiaries. North Macedonia is the only IPA country with a gender-balanced parliament, though Serbia is close with 37 % women. In Turkey, women hold just 17 % of parliamentary seats. Key findings in business Share of women on boards at all-time high and increasing quickly In October 2020, the share of women on EU company boards in the largest listed companies reached 29.5 %. This is an all-time high and an increase of 0.8 pp in just six months. In France, more than 45 % of company board members are women. Belgium, Italy and Sweden all have around 38 % women, while women account for at least one third of board members in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland. However, less than a quarter (23 %) of the EU\u2019s largest companies have gender-balanced boards. In Bulgaria, Estonia and Hungary, more than half of companies do not have any women on their boards. Quotas boost the share of women on boards and speed up progress\u2026.\u00a0 EIGE\u2019s data takes into consideration legislative quotas on the minimum share of women and men on boards in Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Austria and Portugal. Greece and the Netherlands also have quotas, but they have been adopted too recently to feature in the data.\u00a0 In the six quota countries considered in this analysis, the average share of women on boards is 37.6 %. In countries without quotas, the share of women on boards is 24.3 %. In the six quota countries, the share of women on boards increased by an average of 0.9 pp each year before the quota was introduced. This jumped to an average increase of 3.0 pp per year after the quota was introduced. Progress in countries without legally binding quotas stagnates at just 0.7 pp per year. \u2026but share of women board chairs and CEOs still tiny Fewer than 1 in 10 board chairs or CEOs is a woman. This is despite the fact that the number of women board chairs has doubled since 2012 (from 20 of 558 companies in October 2012, to 39 of 548 companies in October 2020), while the number of women CEOs has tripled (from 12 to 41). Share of women on boards lower in IPA beneficiaries than in EU In April 2020, women made up 18 % of board members in the largest listed companies in five of the IPA beneficiaries (there is no data for Albania and Kosovo). The proportion of women was similar across the IPA beneficiaries, ranging from 19% in Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina to 15% in Serbia. *This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence. \u00a0 \u00a0 Further reading Statistical brief: Gender balance in politics 2020\u00a0 Statistical brief: Gender balance in corporate boards 2020 Data Talk: Women and power in the Western Balkans and Turkey Gender Statistics Database: Women and men in decision-making", "url": "https://eige.europa.eu/news/quotas-can-turbocharge-progress-gender-balance-politics-and-business"}, {"id": "EIGE_NEWS_0006", "date": "2021-03-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Covid-19 derails gender equality gains", "text": "Copyright: MasterKeySystem/Shutterstock.comIn the lead up to International Women\u2019s Day on 8 March, the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) has released new findings on the impact of the coronavirus crisis on gender equality in Europe. From job losses and reduced working hours to spikes in domestic violence and overwhelmed counsellors, the effects of the pandemic have hit women the hardest. Severe job losses in women-dominated professions During the first wave of the pandemic, employment for women reduced by 2.2 million across the EU. Women working in retail, accommodation, residential care, domestic work and clothing manufacturing suffered heavy job losses. They make up the bulk of the workforce in these sectors, and 40% of all jobs lost by women during the crisis were in these professions. \u00a0 Despite rising employment in the summer, women gained only half as many jobs as men. This shows that the economic impact of the pandemic is having longer lasting effects for women.\u00a0\u00a0 \"Europe will bounce back, as long as gender equality is front and centre of recovery measures. In a small win for gender equality, Member States will have to show how their economic recovery plans promote gender equality in order to access the EU\u2019s recovery fund. EIGE can help with that by providing gender statistics, which are crucial to understand the different effects of the pandemic on women and men and assess where the money is most needed,\u201d said Carlien Scheele, EIGE\u2019s Director. Work-life balance pressures have increased for women The pandemic has shown the potential of a digital workforce, but teleworking has also heightened work-life balance conflicts, especially for women with young children aged 0-5 years. Despite men taking on more care responsibilities than before, women\u2019s share of unpaid work has increased. Online schooling represents a new form of unpaid care for parents, especially for women who are more involved in the virtual classroom with children. Our study shows that mothers have to deal with interruptions by children more often than fathers when teleworking. Constant distractions and extra care responsibilities for women lowers their productivity and could reduce their career progression and pay. Inadequate support measures for domestic violence victims The pandemic has also seen a rise in reports of domestic violence against women. During the first wave of lockdowns across Europe, shelter and counselling staff were overwhelmed due to increased demand. Staff often felt inexperienced to provide remote support and were worried about victim confidentiality.\u00a0 Support services, such as shelters and counselling hotlines, need more funding from Member States to guarantee that victims have free, round-the-clock access to support. Declaring these services as \u201cessential\u201d is also important as it allows them to keep operating, even during lockdown. In order to be better prepared for a future crisis, action to combat gender-based violence needs to be part of a wider, long-term strategy on disaster and crisis prevention.

The estimations find that increases in the number of migrants from FGM-practising countries since 2011 has pushed up the number of girls at risk in Spain, Luxembourg and Austria. EIGE\u00a0has now calculated the numbers of girls at risk in a total of 13 EU Member States.\u00a0 However, changes in countries of origin of migrants in Spain and Austria have shrunk the share of girls at particularly high risk of FGM. In Austria, for example, the largest group of girls at risk now comes from Iraq. Iraq has a much lower prevalence rate of FGM than Ethiopia, which is where most girls at risk came from in 2011. FGM-affected communities in the EU also largely hold negative views around the practice and believe it is slowly dying out in their countries of origin. \u201cEIGE\u2019s latest estimations of the number of girls at risk of FGM show that legislation and campaigns work. The absolute number of girls at risk has gotten bigger because there are more girls from FGM-practising countries living in the EU, but affected communities are increasingly opposed to the practice and frequently lead efforts to eliminate it. We are winning the fight against FGM,\u201d said Carlien Scheele, EIGE\u2019s Director. EIGE estimates that in Denmark, between 11 and 21 % of girls originating from FGM-practising countries are at risk (1,408 - 2,568 girls). In Spain the share is 9 - 15 % (3,435 - 6,025 girls), 12 - 17 % in Luxembourg (102 - 136 girls) and 12 - 18 % in Austria (735 - 1,083 girls). Asylum seeking girls are at higher risk in all countries for which we have data, with the share of girls at risk reaching 37 % in Denmark, 19 % in Luxembourg and 31 % in Austria. Anti-FGM legislation and policy is strong in all four countries of EIGE\u2019s study. All countries criminalise FGM, including when performed abroad. However, protection is weaker for women and girls trying to enter the EU to seek safety from FGM. Out of the four countries in the study, only Luxembourg formally recognises FGM as grounds for asylum. While FGM has been a factor in successful asylum applications in Denmark, Spain and Austria, such cases are rare. In Spain, the majority of FGM-related applications are rejected because FGM is illegal in the country of origin, though it may still take place in practice. In order to eliminate FGM, EIGE recommends EU Member States provide specialised training to professionals in sectors dealing with affected communities, such as healthcare, education, law enforcement and child protection, asylum and migration. EIGE also recommends countries implement national registration systems to record cases of FGM, invest in grassroots campaigns, and recognise FGM as a form of gender-based persecution in the asylum system. FGM is a severe form of gender-based violence that leaves deep physical and psychological scars on the lives of victims around the world. It is a violent form of subordination of women and girls and it stands in gross contradiction to the principle of gender equality. As long as the practice persists, EIGE will continue to help the EU eliminate it. Notes to editors EIGE has developed a methodology to estimate the number of girls at risk of FGM in the EU and has applied it to a total of 13 Member States. The calculation includes a high-risk and a low-risk scenario. In the high-risk scenario, it is assumed migration has no impact and that girls originating from an FGM-practising country and living in an EU country face the same risk as if they had never migrated. In the low-risk scenario, it is assumed that migration and integration have an impact on risk by changing attitudes to FGM. As part of the study, focus groups were held with FGM-affected communities in Denmark, Luxembourg, Spain and Austria. The communities in each country came from: Austria: Egypt and Sudan. Denmark: Somalia, Iraq and Iran. Luxembourg: Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea and Senegal. Spain: Senegal, Guinea, Mali, Somalia, Nigeria, The Gambia and Ethiopia.

Across the EU, the bulk of unpaid care work is done by women, with 92 % providing un\u00adpaid care several days a week \u2013 as opposed to 68 % of men. Employed women also do more than their fair share of unpaid care work. Across the EU, they spend 90 minutes more per day than employed men on unpaid care. \u2018\u2019The benefits of dividing care work more evenly are clear. Countries with a more equal sharing of unpaid care between women and men, tend to have higher employ\u00adment rates for women and lower gender gaps in earnings,\u2019\u2019 said Carlien Scheele, EIGE\u2019s Director. Balancing the care gap An unequal sharing of care limits women\u2019s job prospects and is a major reason behind the gender pay gap. One way to balance the uneven sharing of unpaid care work is through the use of childcare services. EIGE\u2019s research shows that childcare services lead to higher financial returns for women, compared to men. Women with children under 12 years using childcare services at least 14 hours a week are estimated to earn 4.8 % more on an hourly basis, compared to women who do not outsource childcare. The estimated difference for men is 2.6 %. Yet 14 % of households across the EU report unmet needs for childcare services. For half of them, it\u2019s because of the unaffordable cost. Gender inequality in the paid care sector The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of care for a well-functioning society and economy. Yet the assumption that caring is still women\u2019s work, even when paid, contributes to its undervaluation. Currently, women make up 37 million of the 49 mil\u00adlion care workers in the EU. Many find themselves in low paid, temporary jobs, with little career prospects. What needs to change? For a fairer distribution of unpaid care, we need a dual approach that would support both an equal sharing of care at the family level and accessible, quality care services. First, we need changes at the household level, so that an equal sharing of care tasks between women and men becomes the norm. Second, it is important that people have access to affordable, professional care services that can help tackle the rising care needs expected in the EU as the population ages. Background The report \u2018Gender inequalities in care and consequences for the labour market\u2019 is part of EIGE\u2019s work on monitoring the EU\u2019s progress towards its gender equality commitments under the Beijing Platform for Action.

From recruitment to performance evaluation, EIGE\u2019s handbook shows how organisations can ensure women and men employees feel safe, respected and fulfilled. The content has been tailored to the context of the EU institutions and agencies. Despite laws to prevent discrimination in the workplace, women continue to be under-represented in senior roles, paid less than men and disproportionately subject to sexual harassment. Men can also face discrimination, for example when they don\u2019t conform to stereotypes by asking for help or showing empathy. EIGE\u2019s handbook shows how unconscious bias underpins the unequal way women and men are treated at work. While overt sexism is prohibited under EU law, many workplaces are shaped by sexist beliefs about the fundamental nature of women and men -- for example that men are dominant while women are caring. This impacts career prospects and everyday behaviour in the workplace, such as women more frequently being given tasks that do not contribute to promotion. Testimonials from EU employees in the handbook show that perceived sexism still exists in the EU institutions and agencies. To help organisations root out unconscious bias, the handbook explains what sexism is, provides a checklist for organisations to assess how well they\u2019re doing and offers advice on how to deal with sexist behaviour and workplace practices. Sexism is inefficient as it holds employees back and channels them into the wrong roles. This results on organisations missing out on their employees\u2019 full potential. Sexism can also damage an organisation\u2019s image and undermine diversity and inclusion initiatives. While anti-harassment and anti-discrimination laws are essential, organisations must also implement cultural change to fully eradicate sexism.\u00a0 With the majority of EU institutions led by men while only 34 % of the most senior EU civil service jobs held by women, the guidance in EIGE\u2019s handbook can help change the face of the EU to better represent the reality of its citizens. It should also help get the EU institution and agencies a step closer to achieving the EU\u2019s founding value of gender equality. Further reading Sexism at work: How can we stop it?

Yet persistent under-funding of shelters and domestic violence hotlines has resulted in sometimes patchy support,\u201d said Carlien Scheele, EIGE\u2019s Director in the lead up to the international day to eliminate violence against women. National action plans Ireland, Spain and Lithuania have launched national action plans to eradicate intimate partner violence during the pandemic. Spain has strengthened coordination among its health, police and justice services, as has Lithuania. Ireland has gone further by putting \u20ac160,000 on the table. With that money, the government has helped shelters and hotlines for victims adapt to new remote working conditions. Irish courts have prioritised domestic violence cases and expanded remote hearings. The police are checking up on women who have faced violence in the past. Legislation Several countries have adapted legislation to declare shelters and hotlines \u201cessential services\u201d to keep them accessible at all times. In Latvia, Estonia, Slovakia and France, legislation now obliges governments to provide women facing violence at home with alternative accommodation. Estonian courts have been empowered to issue temporary restraining orders against violent partners, protecting the victim from homelessness and pinning accountability on the abuser.\u00a0 Awareness raising campaigns Almost every EU country rolled out awareness raising campaigns to let victims know about the help available. Greece, Finland and Portugal addressed refugees and migrants, while other countries reached out to women from Roma communities, LGBTIQ+ women, or those with hearing impairments. Spain\u2019s campaign emphasised that domestic violence is a human rights violation -- not a private issue. Awareness campaigns are important for witnesses, who can fail to intervene because they might not recognise intimate partner violence when they see it. Campaigns also provide clear guidance on how witnesses can help when they fear they will make the situation worse. Around 20\u201330 % of calls to domestic violence hotlines come from witnesses -- they ought to be reassured and guided through this daunting process. EIGE\u2019s research shows witnesses often want to help in ways aside from reporting to the police, for example by talking to the victim or helping them access support services. Guidance on such ways to help should also be part of campaigns. Shelter and counselling staff As EU countries re-enter lockdowns, governments can learn from the positive action taken during the first wave of the pandemic -- as well as the shortcomings. Shelter and counselling staff were overwhelmed with increased demand and heightened distress of victims; they felt unprepared to provide remote support and worried about victim confidentiality. There was not enough personal protective equipment to continue helping victims face-to-face. Shaky support systems In the majority of EU countries, the pandemic exposed overall shaky support systems for victims of gender-based violence. A lack of funding and shelter space resulted in women being put up in hotels and privately provided Airbnbs. While quick action is laudable, fire fighting measures delivered by the private sector should not be the solution to save lives. Although natural disasters and pandemics lead to surges in violence against women globally, no EU Member State had a disaster plan in place to deal with this. Covid-19 has shone a harsh light on how unprepared societies often are to protect victims of intimate partner violence. Government must not turn a blind eye. To raise awareness about violence against women and kick-off the \u201816 days of activism against gender-based violence' campaign, important buildings around the world will be lit up in orange. EIGE will light up Europe House in Vilnius on 25 November. In Brussels, the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament and the European External Action Service will be lit up the same day.\u00a0 The theme of this year\u2019s campaign is \u2018Orange the World: Fund, Respond, Prevent, Collect!\u2019 \u00a0For media enquiries, please contact Veronica Collins, +370 5 2157 449, veronica.collins@eige.europa.eu Further reading Intimate partner violence and witness intervention: What are the deciding factors?

EIGE has noted this development in several recent studies. The 25-year review of the Beijing Platform for Action shows that access to sexual and reproductive health services varies greatly between the Member States, with some countries introducing restrictions to services such as abortion. In order to achieve gender equality in the European Union, this area needs close attention. EU Member States must ensure women have access to services that reflect their gendered health needs, such as hormonal contraception and abortion. Next year, EIGE\u2019s Gender Equality Index will have a special focus in the area of health, including sexual and reproductive health. This is a priority in the EU.

The latest Gender Equality Index from the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) shows that the EU is improving by just half a point each year. Among the Member States, Sweden, Denmark and France keep their top spots. The awards for most improved go to Italy, Luxembourg and Malta, with each gaining around 10 points since 2010. Greece, Hungary and Romania are lagging behind the rest. \u201cWe have seen small, steady gains year on year but this time we have a reason for concern. The coronavirus pandemic poses a serious threat to gender equality progress, which we cannot afford. More than ever, policymakers will need to use the results of our Index to design inclusive solutions that promote gender equality in our society, both during and after the pandemic,\u201d said Carlien Scheele, EIGE\u2019s director. \u201cGender equality must be sought in all areas of life for all Europeans - regardless of their gender - to reach their full potential. The Gender Equality Index is a crucial tool in this quest as it tracks progress. I congratulate those countries that have improved their score over the past year. Nonetheless, there is still a long road ahead in many aspects, particularly in the digital world. As our present and future are increasingly digital, we need to ensure that women and girls occupy their fair share of this sector and are encouraged to contribute towards its growth. The EU Gender Equality Strategy adopted this year sets out key actions for the next 5 years, to step up the work towards equality and we need to see it through and fully implemented to ensure that women and men can be free, will thrive and lead,\u201d\u00a0said Helena Dalli, European Commissioner for Equality. Power driving progress Improved gender equality in decision-making is the main driver of progress in the EU. The domain of power, which measures the engagement of women and men in decision-making in the areas of politics, economics, media, research and sports accounts for 65 % of all progress in the Index since 2010. Yet with a score of 53.5 out of 100, it remains the lowest scoring domain. Improvements have been biggest in the private sector, largely due to the improved gender balance on company boards. Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden and the UK have almost a third of women on their company boards. France is the only country to have over 40 %. While these countries have been helping to boost the score in this domain, the rate of change will soon slow down unless other countries start to catch up. Segregation holds us back One of the biggest problems holding back gender equality is segregation in education and work. This means a concentration of either women or men in certain subjects or jobs. Despite efforts to tackle this issue, such as special initiatives to encourage women to study science, engineering or ICT, segregation has actually increased since 2010. In the EU, only two out of ten ICT jobs are held by women. In the care sector, there is a lack of men. They make up just 15 % of workers in nursing, midwifery and personal care in health services. The digital world and the future of work This year\u2019s Index has a special focus on the effects of digitalisation on the working lives of women and men. Women face a slightly higher risk of being replaced in their jobs by robots and are underrepresented in developing artificial intelligence, digital start-ups and high technology products such as space crafts, optical fibres, lasers and microchips. Overall, men dominate the development of new technologies across the EU. Interestingly, the expansion of work organised through online platforms is reproducing traditional gender inequalities, such as the gender pay gap and gender segregation. For example, men are more likely to work in software development or food delivery, whereas women work more in online translation or domestic services. The Gender Equality Index 2020 is out today.

Each year, it gives the EU and its Member States a score from 1 to 100, where a score of 100 stands for full equality. The scores are based on the gaps between women and men and levels of achievement in six core domains: work, money, knowledge, time, power and health, and their sub-domains. The Index gives visibility to areas that need improvement by providing a detailed analysis at EU and member state-level for policymakers. The Index includes two additional domains: violence against women and intersecting inequalities, which Index also shows the diverse realities that different groups of women and men face. The analysis of intersecting inequalities examines how factors such as disability, age, level of education, country of birth and family type, intersect with gender to create different pathways in women\u2019s and men\u2019s lives.

Find out on 29 October when EIGE gives its annual update on the state of gender equality in the EU. This year, the Gender Equality Index takes a special look at digitalisation in the world of work, and the consequences for gender equality. We will also highlight how digitalisation and the Covid-19 pandemic have affected women and men in their working lives. We will shed light on less explored topics, such as the emergence of new types of jobs organised through online applications. These can include ride-hailing services, food delivery or household cleaners. Who is doing these jobs? Do they help or hinder gender equality? The Index will also explore the effects of digitalisation for some groups that may face additional disadvantages, such as women with disabilities or women from migrant and ethnic backgrounds, when data is available. As always, the highlight of the Index is the scoring for gender equality in the EU and all Member States. Each country gets a detailed analysis, showing their progress since 2010, achievements and areas for improvement. Check out our conference webpage to find out more Background information The Gender Equality Index is an important policy-making tool to measure the progress of gender equality in the EU over time. Each year, it gives the EU and the Member States a score from 1 to 100. A score of 100 would mean that a country had reached full equality between women and men. The scores are based on the gaps between women and men and levels of achievement in six core domains: work, money, knowledge, time, power and health, and their sub-domains. The Index also has two additional domains: violence against women and intersecting inequalities. The Index gives visibility to areas that need improvement and supports policy makers to design more effective gender equality measures.

In the past months, all JHA agencies have taken the necessary measures to ensure business continuity and uninterrupted operational support. At the same time, the Justice and Home Affairs agencies' network (JHAAN), under the chair of Eurojust, has initiated a dialogue to share their experiences in dealing with the pandemic and consider new avenues for closer cooperation among the agencies and with key stakeholders inside and outside the EU. \u00a0 The agencies\u2019 individual and joint efforts to deal with the impact of the pandemic have been captured in a Joint Paper on the COVID-19 response by the JHA agencies, which was formally endorsed by the heads of JHA agencies during a videoconference held on 9 July. During their meeting, the heads discussed the latest developments, including the fundamental rights implications of government COVID-19 measures, the quick adaptation of organised crime to the changing circumstances and the recent surge in drug use, domestic violence and child abuse. To tackle these and other issues more effectively related to the protection of citizens and freedoms, there is a need for increased interagency cooperation in the field of digitalisation and for sustainable financial resources in the coming years. The COVID-19 pandemic coincides with the 10th anniversary of the Justice and Home Affairs agencies' network. In the past decade, this family of JHA agencies joined forces as guardians of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. Together, they contributed to the implementation of EU\u2019s objectives in the fields of migration, asylum and external border management, the fight against serious organised crime, drug trafficking and terrorism, gender equality and respect for fundamental rights.\u00a0 For more information, please contact\u00a0\u017divile Macijauskien\u0117 at\u00a0zivile.macijauskiene@eige.europa.eu.

Only Montenegro has a gender-balanced parliament. Men dominate political party leadership In November 2019, women accounted for less than one in five (17.1 %) leaders of major political parties in the Member States. In the IPA beneficiaries, women account for 6.5 % of political party leaders. None of the major political parties in Czechia, Hungary, Malta or Slovakia has had a woman leader since the first data collection in 2011. The same is true of all IPA beneficiaries except Turkey. Less than half of EU countries have legislative quotas\u2026 Legislative candidate quotas, which aim to ensure a minimum proportion of each gender amongst candidates, are currently in place in 11 Member States and in all IPA beneficiaries except Turkey. Targets range from 50 % women in Belgium and France to 30 % in Ireland.\u00a0 Ensuring a minimum proportion of each gender on candidate lists does not necessarily translate into electoral gains and only the Spanish and Portuguese parliaments have so far reached their quota targets (40 % and 33 % respectively). In the IPA beneficiaries, the Albanian, Kosovo, North Macedonian and Serbian parliaments have reached their respective quota targets. ...yet quotas can bring big change over time The proportion of women members of parliament in countries with legislative candidate quotas has almost doubled since 2004, from 18.2 % to 34.0 %. This is an increase of 15 percentage points. Countries without quotas increased from 24.8 % to 30.8 % since 2004. This is an increase of just 6.0 percentage points. Without change, countries with legislative quotas will achieve gender balance in six years, whereas those taking no action will need more than two decades. Business The share of women on boards is at an all-time high In October 2019, the share of women on boards of the largest publicly listed companies in the EU has more than doubled to 28.8 % from 11.9 % in 2010. However, more than seven in 10 board members are still men. France is the only country where gender balance has been achieved on company boards (45.2 %). In the IPA beneficiaries, women hold on average just 17.8 % of board-level positions. The impact of action to bring in more women is striking Since 2010, countries that have taken legislative action have seen a rise of 27.2 percentage points, resulting in 36.5 % women on boards. Countries that have implemented non-regulatory measures have seen half that progress since 2010, with a rise of 14.3 percentage points, resulting in 28.1 % women on boards. Countries that have taken no action have seen almost no progress. Progress is slower at senior executive level\u00a0 In the EU, women account for just 18.6 % of senior executive positions in the largest listed companies. Countries that have taken legislative action and have the highest proportion of women board members actually have the lowest share of women senior executives (14.7 %). Fewer than one in 10 in the largest listed companies in the EU have a woman chair or CEO.

Most professionals in the formal care sector are women and their working conditions are often very demanding. Heavy workloads, night shifts and low pay characterise their work. These factors will not attract more people to a sector that is already overburdened and under-resourced. EIGE\u2019s new report on gender equality and long-term care highlights why Europe needs to care more about care. \u201cCovid-19 has shown how essential carers are to the well-functioning of society and the economy. During the pandemic, people showed their appreciation for care workers by clapping nightly across the EU. But we must also recognise the value of care work by increasing wages and improving working conditions. These measures could also attract more men to work in the sector \u2013 making it more gender-balanced,\u201d said Carlien Scheele, EIGE\u2019s director. The shortage of home-based long-term care services mean that women often pick up the burden of unpaid care at home. This limits their career opportunities and earning potential. Children are also involved in caring for family members - girls more often than boys. Caring for adult family members means that children might miss out on opportunities to live a normal life and socialise with people their own age. Cost is a major reason why many people cannot access long-term care services. It affects over half (52%) of the households in the EU who would need this kind of care. People with low incomes, low qualifications, migrants and ethnic minority women have more difficulties accessing long-term care services. Women live longer than men and are more likely to experience difficulties in their everyday activities due to health problems, especially as they get older. This is why they need long-term care more than men. 52 % of women and 45 % of men aged 65 and above experience limitations in their daily lives. The European Pillar of Social Rights endorses everyone\u2019s right to affordable and good quality long-term care services, especially home care. The option to have care provided at home is more cost-effective and offers better care solutions, compared to institutionalised care. More importantly, it gives people a better quality of life, allowing people to make decisions about their lives and stay in their own homes.

Several countries saw spikes in domestic violence reports. As lockdowns ease, the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) is taking a closer look at how we can protect women in times of crisis \u2013 be it a pandemic, natural disaster or economic recession.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Domestic violence happens everywhere. Yet each EU Member State collects data in a different way, with important details sometimes missing. To properly measure the extent of violence and predict what will happen in a crisis, we need to know more. How many women have faced physical, sexual, psychological and economic violence? What was their relationship with the perpetrator? How many requests for protection orders have been granted? EIGE\u2019s overview of how well Member States currently answer such questions will soon be published in our Gender Statistics Database. Support services need to be proactive and coordinated. Police, health and social services should work together to identify women at particularly high risk, such as those who have previously faced violence at the hands of a partner. Working with perpetrators can also be effective and has been done online during the pandemic. EIGE\u2019s Risk assessment and management guide can help police implement such a multi-agency approach to ensure no one falls through the cracks. Family, friends and neighbours should check in with those at risk and raise the alarm if they suspect violence. With abusers always present, lockdown measures can make it tricky to report. Government-led campaigns can help raise people\u2019s awareness of domestic violence, how to spot it, and how to get help. In March, for example, about a quarter of calls to the domestic violence hotline in Spain came from friends and family. EIGE is delving deeper into what helps witnesses act and will be publishing its results later this year. Creativity and adaptability are key. Over the last few months, governments, support services and private companies have worked together to create digital tools that facilitate reporting and provide hotel rooms for those fleeing violence. Pharmacists and delivery personnel have been trained to assist victims. What did we get right and what will we need to do better to protect women from violence? EIGE will provide answers in a special study on Covid-19 and violence against women, to be published later this year. Rapid action taken by several countries shows understanding that violence in the home is a problem which crises can exacerbate. The most wide-ranging measures to prevent domestic violence are laid out in the Istanbul Convention, which has been signed by all EU Member States and ratified by 21. Following this guidance remains the best way to protect women \u2013 in crisis times and beyond. \u00a0\u00a0 Further reading Gender Statistics Database: Administrative data on Intimate Partner Violence Advancing administrative data collection on intimate partner violence and gender-related killings of women Risk assessment and management guide Factors that help witnesses of intimate partner violence act Study on Covid-19 and violence against women Helplines for victims of violence in the EU MetadataKeywords: coronavirusgender-based violenceintimate partner violence/domestic violence", "url": "https://eige.europa.eu/news/covid-19-and-gender-based-violence-has-pandemic-taught-us-anything"}, {"id": "EIGE_NEWS_0019", "date": "2020-05-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIGE\u2019s gender budgeting toolkit: This is how the EU Funds can speed up gender equality", "text": "Hyejin Kang / ShutterstockEU Funds can be transformative: they\u2019ve helped reduce inequality across the EU. Yet when it comes to equality between women and men, they\u2019re not reaching their full potential. This is why the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) has released a step-by-step toolkit to help those working with EU Funds better fit their programmes to the gender equality goals of the EU and its Member States. Gender budgeting is now more important than ever and needs to be considered when the EU gets ready to deploy stimulus packages and investments to address the effects of the Covid-19 crisis, including the use of \u20ac37 billion in EU Funds. EIGE\u2019s new gender budgeting toolkit has been designed with practitioners in mind. It is a collection of 11 tools that help users keep in mind the different needs of women and men throughout EU Funds process, from the development of indicators to the definition of project selection criteria, the involvement of partners, and the monitoring, reporting and evaluation of programmes. It will support managing authorities involved in EU Funds programming, intermediate bodies implementing EU Funds projects, gender equality bodies, and staff working at the EU level with EU Funds, helping them implement the horizontal principle of gender equality. The toolkit highlights good practices from EU Member States and pinpoints links to relevant EU Funds regulations and provisions, helping users know how, why and where to apply the tool. This will help EU Member States align their EU Funds programmes with the EU\u2019s and national gender-equality strategies and regulatory frameworks. As the Covid-19 crisis has shown, care is a vital part of our economies, yet often missing from balance sheets. That is why EIGE has developed a model that allows Member States to make the connection between time use, multiple care roles and EU Funds interventions, allowing a better reflection of the value of care in our economies. This is in line with the EU\u2019s new gender equality strategy, which highlights the need for EU Funds to support work-life balance measures. Gender budgeting is a strategy to achieve gender equality through allocating public resources in a way that addresses the specific needs of women and men. It is a tool for gender mainstreaming, to which the EU has been committed since 1995. Gender budgeting can help ensure economic recovery measures post-Covid-19 are gender-fair and leave no one behind. EIGE's gender budgeting toolkit is currently in English but will soon be available in 22 EU languages. It is available both as an online tool and in pdf format.

The pandemic has exposed how common this serious human rights abuse is and how insufficient the measures to fight it still are. The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) call on the EU and its Member States to use the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to step up their efforts to effectively protect women's rights. \u201cNo country in Europe has achieved gender equality \u2014 the prevalence of domestic violence is a sad reminder of that,\u201d says EIGE Director Carlien Scheele. \u201cYet chronic underreporting of violence at the hands of a partner means we only know a partial truth. Governments need to make clear that violence is not a private matter and ensure the police, justice and health sectors are able to work together to help victims.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cEven without the coronavirus pandemic, one in five women in the EU have been a victim of domestic violence. Moreover, women in households that struggle to make ends meet are even at a higher risk,\u201d says FRA Director Michael O\u2019Flaherty pointing to an earlier FRA survey. \u201cThe current spike in domestic abuses underlines that the EU and its Member States need to act to protect women during this crisis, and bolster their measures in the future to end violence against women once and for all.\u201d As lockdowns and quarantines continue in most of Europe, women face a higher risk of domestic violence. The danger is real. Globally, 64\u00a0% of women who are killed die at the hands of an intimate partner or family member, a study on homicides finds. Many EU countries reacted swiftly, putting in place counselling support, providing refuge for victims in hotel rooms, launching awareness campaigns or promoting hotline numbers. EIGE and FRA welcome these measures. Yet, the extent of action needed to safeguard victims has exposed how insufficient the support measures are even during normal times. For example, the number of beds in women\u2019s shelters is only about half that required under the Istanbul Convention, which 21 EU countries have signed and the EU has committed to accede to. The end of lockdowns will also bring new challenges. Financial insecurity in view of income and job losses, as well as a looming recession, can present additional triggers for violence and may make it more difficult for victims to leave an abusive relationship. FRA\u2019s earlier survey shows that 30% of women who find it difficult to make ends meet have experienced intimate partner violence, compared with 18% of women who do not struggle to get by. This underlines that the EU needs to put in place lasting structures to end violence against women. The covid-19 crisis provides an opportunity to step up our efforts \u2013 we must seize it. EIGE and FRA call on the EU and its Member States to consider the following action: EU countries that have not yet ratified the Istanbul Convention or not fully aligned their national laws with its requirements should do so swiftly. This would, for example, facilitate the use of emergency barring orders. In countries where legislation already provides for these orders, police should use them more often. The police, justice and health sectors in EU Member States should work together to manage the risk of violence against women. Professionals in these sectors should be properly resourced and trained to respond to such cases. Data collection on violence against women should be harmonised between EU member states to ensure the phenomenon can be adequately measured and addressed. In light of the many positive measures to eliminate violence against women at the national level, the EU should coordinate the exchange of good practices between member states. Many EU countries have legal definitions of hate crimes (against ethnic and sexual minorities for example). A workable legal definition of femicide to denote the killing of women and girls because of their gender should be considered. We support the European Commission\u2019s proposal to add violence against women on the list of EU crimes defined in the EU Treaty. This would recognise the structural nature of violence against women and propel joint efforts to eliminate it. \u00a0 As long as women face violence, gender equality will be impossible. And as long as we do not have gender equality, violence against women will continue. Let\u2019s work together to end violence against women once and for all.

We are learning what it means to self-quarantine, work from home, home-school children, lose a job or even a loved one. Each person\u2019s situation is different, but for sure, the coronavirus will reveal the different realities of women and men. At the frontline of this coronavirus pandemic are the healthcare workers who are working around the clock and putting themselves at risk to care for patients. Most of the nurses and healthcare workers in the EU are women. Their workload is very demanding, often taking an emotional toll. Yet their profession is one of the most undervalued, and under-paid jobs in the EU. Men\u2019s mortality rate is higher Preliminary figures show that women and men are being infected by the coronavirus in about equal numbers, but the mortality rate is higher for men than for women [1]. The World Health Organization recommends to keep up healthy food and exercise habits to boost the immune system and avoid unhealthy ones such as smoking and consuming excessive alcohol. More men smoke than women and are therefore more likely to be at risk of developing a serious disease if infected with the virus. Extra challenges for public transport users Our Gender Equality Index findings show that women rely much more on public transportation than men. This puts women at greater risk of coming into contact with the virus, when they have to either get to work, visit a doctor or do the grocery shopping. This is especially the case with single parents, who are less likely to have a car due to financial reasons. 18 % of them say that public transport is the only method of transport available to them. In countries where restrictions on movement have tightened, public transport has been reduced or even shut down. This makes life more difficult for people who rely on these services and still need to get to work, visit a doctor or do the grocery shopping Concern for severe job losses in women-dominated professions The closure or near-closure of many businesses could have a severe effect on many women-dominated professions. Flight attendants, tour operators, sales assistants, hotel cleaners and hairdressers are often already in precarious jobs and will probably not be paid nor entitled to paid sick leave. These people are likely to have difficulty paying for basic necessities such as groceries, rent and bills in the coming days and months. EIGE\u2019s research shows that a quarter of women employees across the EU are in a precarious job. For migrants, the situation is even worse. Nearly one in three non-EU born women (35 %) and one in four men (24 %) work in precarious jobs. Unpaid care work will increase Even without a crisis, caring responsibilities usually fall heavily on women. Now with the closure of schools and workplaces, their unpaid workload is likely to further increase. If older relatives get sick, they will also need looking after. The situation for single parents can be even more difficult, especially when options for informal childcare are unavailable. Physical distancing is not an option for everyone In the EU, nearly a quarter of households depend on informal care from relatives or friends. As physical distancing and confinement measures become the norm, it will become harder for family, friends and neighbours to provide or receive such care. There are also many people in our society, for whom physical distancing is not an option. We have 61 million women and 47 million men with disabilities in the EU. Many of them depend on help from others to eat, dress or shower, which makes physical distancing almost impossible. Across the EU, most of the professional carers working with people with disabilities or older people are women (83 %). Domestic abuse increases in times of crisis These times of social isolation increase the risk of domestic abuse. Women in violent relationships are stuck at home and exposed to their abuser for longer periods of time. This makes it very difficult for them to call helplines as the perpetrator is always around. It can also be harder for women to leave their abuser once the crisis is over, due to the financial insecurity that might follow. Neighbours or relatives can have an important role in contacting the police if they suspect that violence is occurring, especially when the victim is not able to call for help. Where are women decision-makers? While nurses are working non-stop behind the scenes in hospitals to look after patients, we mostly see men out in the public domain, making the news headlines. They are the ones who hold most of the positions of power in our society. In this crisis, it is usually men who are making all the important decisions, which affect the everyday lives of citizens. This imbalance of decision-making power means that women are left out from shaping the decisions that affect their own lives. Policy measures must consider the different needs of women and men The response from policymakers must consider the different experiences faced by women and men during a pandemic to ensure that everyone gets the help they most need. There is a big need for sex-disaggregated data to fully understand how women and men are affected by the virus. Not only for infection rates, but also the economic impacts, the distribution of care work and the extent of domestic violence. It is also time for leaders to recognise and give more value to the important work done by those who are in the frontlines of a health crisis, such as healthcare workers, home carers and domestic workers. \u00a0 [1] The Lancet (2019), COVID-19: the gendered impacts of the outbreak, Available at:\u00a0https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30526-2/fulltext#%20 Read more:\u00a0EIGE has developed a\u00a0webpage\u00a0with more information about the coronavirus pandemic from a gender perspective.

Priorities include reducing economic inequalities, creating better work-life balance, combating violence against women, and making sure that important issues, such as climate change and digitalisation take gender equality concerns into account. \u201cOur leaders have been given a clear road map to make the changes that Europe needs\u201d said Carlien Scheele, Director of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). \u201cThe strategy sends a strong message that gender equality is a cross-cutting issue in all policy areas. Leaders have a responsibility to ensure that it is always considered in decisions affecting the everyday lives of EU citizens.\u201d EIGE\u2019s review of the Beijing Platform for Action, published ahead of International Women\u2019s Day, reinforces the Commission\u2019s message. Europe has several gender equality challenges needing immediate attention. One big challenge that needs tackling is the unequal sharing of unpaid housework and caring responsibilities. This is a major cause of the EU\u2019s 16 % gender pay gap. On average, women do an extra 13 hours of unpaid work each week, compared to men. This limits women\u2019s career opportunities and prevents them from entering positions of power. On company boards, decision-making positions mostly go to men, with women occupying less than a third of board seats (27.7 %) in large companies across the EU. Another priority for the coming years is to combat violence against women. At home, in workplaces and on the streets, women continue to face harassment and violence. Cyber violence is a growing concern, with 20 % of young women having experienced sexual harassment online and four in ten women journalists having censored themselves after incidents of online abuse. EIGE recommends that the EU accedes to the Istanbul Convention, as a way of strengthening the legal framework to prevent violence against women and protect victims. Gender equality concerns related to climate change have also made their way to the Commission\u2019s strategy. EIGE\u2019s research indicated several areas of concern. For example, the rising costs of energy can make life very difficult for people on low incomes, such as older women or single mothers. High energy bills can contribute to extra stress on physical and mental health, especially when it becomes unaffordable to use heating in winter or keep the lights switched on. When it comes to making important decisions about the environment, it is still mostly men who are taking them. \u00a0\u201cThe Beijing Platform for Action is 25 years old but countries are still a long way off from achieving women\u2019s empowerment. Europe needs to fulfil its gender equality commitments. By ensuring that gender equality concerns are included in every policy, including the process of policymaking itself, the EU and the Member States will be on track to fulfil their commitment to creating a more gender-equal society for all,\u201d said Carlien Scheele.

How can dialogue help the integration of young migrant women into secondary education? These and other questions are answered in the reports, working papers, government documents, white papers and evaluations that make up EIGE's grey literature collection. The 19 tailor-made reading lists present literature on current EU policies, gender indicators and data, and the situation of gender mainstreaming. Resources come from all EU Member States and are available in several EU languages. In addition to grey literature, our online library gives access to policy documents, books, articles, studies and specialised databases.

With a detailed analysis of remaining gender equality challenges, politicians can use the Index as a strategic guide to plan policy measures,\" said Virginija Langbakk, Director of the European Institute for Gender Equality. The results also reveal interesting findings in comparison with the EU. In the domain of power, Albania's score of 60.9 is remarkably higher than the EU average of 51.9. This reflects the high representation of women in political and economic bodies. However there is still a long way to go in the domain of time, with 51.1 % of women caring for children or grandchildren, older people or people with disabilities every day, in comparison with 24.6 % of men. In the EU it is 37.5 % of women, compared with 24.7 % of men Montenegro's high score of 86.9 in the domain of health is close to the EU average of 88.1. And as in the EU countries, Montenegro has the most catching up to do in the domain of power, which scores 35.1. Motherhood remains an obstacle to career progress, with large numbers of women being asked about their marital status (64.1 %), how many children they have (45.5 %), or their plans to have children (35.6 %) in job interviews. \u00a0 Albania and Montenegro are the third and fourth of the EU candidate countries and potential candidates to develop a Gender Equality Index, following Serbia and North Macedonia.

Senior EU figures such as Helena Dalli, EU Commissioner for Equality, and Evelyn Regner, Chair of the European Parliament's gender equality committee, will join EIGE to take stock of what has been achieved and give their thoughts on how the Institute can help make equality between women and men a reality. \u00a0 EIGE was set up to help the EU Institutions and Member States root out persistent inequalities between women and men. EIGE's production of comparable and reliable data enables policymakers to integrate gender equality into all policy areas, from the economy to climate change. Equal does not mean identical, which is why EIGE has built a library of gender mainstreaming resources to help policymakers take women and men's different needs into consideration. In 2020, EIGE will release a gender budgeting toolkit to help the EU and Member States ensure women and men benefit equally from public resources. 2020 will see the 25-year anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action, a UN commitment to which the EU is a signatory. EIGE\u2019s recommendations to help the EU implement this blueprint led to the Finnish government calling for more gender mainstreaming and gender budgeting in all EU policy areas \u2013 one of the most advanced political commitments to gender equality. EIGE will present its recommendations to world leaders, international organisations and NGOs at the UN in March. As the world changes, new challenges to gender equality are emerging. EIGE has been examining the impact of digitalisation, with the 2020 Gender Equality Index planned to focus on issues such as the effect of technology on the workplace.\u00a0 Gender equality is written into the EU's founding treaties, yet we are still far from the finish line. This is despite the fact that improving gender equality could bring an extra 10.5 million jobs and 3.15 trillion in GDP by 2050. EIGE looks forward to continuing its work and hopes the new decade sees further progress towards full equality between women and men, in Europe and beyond. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For more information, please contact Veronica Collins, phone: +370 5 2157 449, veronica.collins@eige.europa.eu Follow #EIGE10 on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn for more updates on our 10 year anniversary event.

A new study from EIGE provides a gender analysis of policies on education and training of migrants and presents some initiatives that work on the ground. \"Effective integration of migrants can contribute to tackling the challenges of ageing societies and labour market shortages in the European Union. The practices from France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and Sweden show what works and how governments can adjust policies and measures to target the different needs of women and men migrants and enable their contribution to their host country and society,\" said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE's Director. Currently, most EU and Member State policies on education and training have been designed using a \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 approach that does not distinguish between the different needs of women and men. Young women and men with a migrant background are almost twice as likely to be out of education, employment or training than their native-born counterparts. Boys with a migrant background fare particularly poorly and are the most likely to quit school early. \u00a0 Women are primarily considered in terms of their vulnerability, even though highly-skilled women actually have higher rates of migration than both low-skilled women and highly-skilled men. Stereotypes in Member States reduce migrant women to the role of \"passive wife\" or \"mother\" and result in integration initiatives for women centring around family management. The practices on the ground show that a tailored approach can include the provision of free childcare during language classes, or mentoring by other migrant women. Indeed, many education and training initiatives are led by women with a migrant background. EIGE's study provides detailed guidance on how the EU and Member States can best harness the potential of migrant women and men through gender-sensitive policymaking. \u00a0 For more information, please contact Veronica Collins, phone: +370 5 2157 449, veronica.collins@eige.europa.eu Further reading Download: the infographic on education and training of migrants Read the study on education and training of migrants Read the factsheet on education and training of migrants Explore: Gender mainstreaming methods and tools MetadataKeywords: education & trainingmigrationwomen", "url": "https://eige.europa.eu/news/education-and-training-migrant-women-what-works"}, {"id": "EIGE_NEWS_0028", "date": "2019-12-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Ageing societies, migration and climate change bring new challenges for gender equality", "text": "Photo: Chiara LuxardoIt is almost a quarter of a century since the Beijing Platform for Action was adopted by 189 governments following a landmark UN conference in 1995. New research from EIGE shows that no EU country has yet fully implemented this blueprint for women's empowerment, with issues such as ageing societies, migration and climate change bringing new challenges. \u201cThe ageing population of the EU brings new challenges for gender equality as women continue to be the main providers of care. While unpaid care work is indispensable to the wellbeing of individuals and wider society, its contribution to economic growth is largely invisible,\u201d says Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s director. Caring responsibilities keep 7.7 million women and about half a million men out of the labour market and for the same reason, 9 million women, compared to 0.6 million men work part time. More women (19.7\u00a0%) than men (14.9\u00a0%) provide care for older persons and persons with disabilities, particularly among the older population aged 50-64. Long-term care services remain insufficient across many Member States and are missing from EU targets. When it comes to gender equality and climate change, although women are more likely to adopt eco-friendly behaviour, key decision-making positions in the environmental sector are dominated by men: only a fifth of government ministers dealing with environment, climate change, energy and transport are women. Energy efficiency can contribute to reducing the level of energy poverty\u2013 especially for single-parent households, which are most affected (12.1\u00a0% at EU level). Single-female households are worst affected by energy poverty (11.3\u00a0%), followed by single-male households (9.4 %). Migration has triggered a response focussed on security and border control as opposed to the specific needs of migrants. Women require gender-sensitive measures throughout the asylum process, from female interviewers and interpreters to services for pregnant women at reception centres. Significant effort is needed on integration: Around one in two people from a non-EU migrant background are at risk of poverty and social exclusion, and half of migrant women are out of employment. Gender-based violence remains common, with every third woman in the EU affected by physical or sexual violence. Cyber violence is of increasing concern, with 20 % of young women having experienced sexual violence online and 40 % of journalists self-censoring after facing cyber harassment. The web has no borders but the lack of an EU-level instrument to combat cyber violence can result in abuse going unpunished. Although there has been indisputable progress since 1995, there have also been setbacks. Recent years have seen the increasing clout of voices hostile to gender equality, with chilling effects in some Member States: resistance to ratification of the Istanbul Convention, efforts to ban gender studies at universities, attempts to restrict women's access to abortion, and shrinking space for women\u2019s rights organisations. EIGE\u2019s forthcoming review of the Beijing Platform for Action in the EU Member States was prepared at the request of Finland\u2019s Presidency of the Council of the EU. It contributes to global efforts to monitor the implementation of commitments to gender equality and women's empowerment.

In the long run, this can help to improve trust in police and encourage reporting,\u201d says Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s director in the lead up to the international day to eliminate violence against women. One of the innovative aspects of the guide is the multi-agency approach to risk assessment, which is not a common practice around the EU. In most cases, the victims of violence are treated in isolation, with different authorities working in silos. EIGE\u2019s guide shows the benefit of the police, justice and health sectors working together to make sure that victims get the essential services in time. These can range from counselling services to financial assistance. The guide also recommends that an individual risk assessment strategy be developed in close cooperation with the victim. It should take their specific situation and needs into account to ensure that they are protected in a way that best fits their needs and those of their children. EIGE\u2019s risk assessment guide can also assist Member States with their reporting obligations under the Istanbul Convention, Victims\u2019 Rights Directive and EU protection order legislation. It offers a way to transform articles from these legal texts into concrete actions on the ground. In addition to the guide, EIGE has also published a report that gives an overview of risk assessment and management practices in each EU Member State. It outlines the approach taken by each country, identifies gaps and challenges, and proposes a way to improve the existing policies. To raise awareness about violence against women and kick-off the \u201816 days of activism against gender-based violence' campaign, important monuments around the world will be lit up in orange. EIGE will light up Europe House in Vilnius on 25 November and the European Commission's headquarters in Brussels will light up on 24 November.

[1] In 2016, 16 EU Member States reported a total of 788 women killed by a partner or family member. In the remaining 12 Member States there is no comparable or available data disaggregated by sex and the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator on women victims of intentional homicide.

New research from EIGE shows that Member States are allocating less attention to the institutional structures that have helped narrow the gaps between women and men. WATCH: Power Up conference live \u201cProgress on gender equality cannot be taken for granted,\u201d said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s Director. \u201cGovernments need to turn up the power and provide adequate resources for the institutional mechanisms that advance gender equality.\u201d While all Member States have governmental gender equality bodies, several have been demoted in the governmental hierarchy and had their functions decreased. Trends over the past decade have resulted in independent gender equality bodies being merged with other anti-discrimination organisations. The commitment to gender mainstreaming has weakened since 2012, with only a quarter of Member States performing highly in this field. And while most Member States have the methods and tools to collect gender-disaggregated data, production and dissemination is lacking in several countries. This can make it difficult to adequately assess the situation of gender equality. \"If we want to see progress, gender equality must be woven into each stage of all policy processes, from the collection of sex-disaggregated data to the gender-sensitive evaluation of government action. That is the aim of gender mainstreaming, to which the EU Member States have been committed since 1995 when they adopted the Beijing Platform for Action at the UN World Conference on Women,\" said Barbara Limanowska, EIGE's Gender Mainstreaming Programme Coordinator. The forthcoming report \u2018Institutional Mechanisms for Gender Equality and Gender Mainstreaming\u2019 compares data from 2018 with data gathered in 2012 to assess trends in governmental commitments to gender equality.

This places the country in 16th place in comparison with the EU countries. In the domain of power, the country scores better than the EU. North Macedonia has 52.6 points, compared to the EU average of 51.9. However, significant gender inequalities remain, especially when it comes to income and earnings, and the sharing of household responsibilities.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith its own Gender Equality Index, North Macedonia can now monitor its progress in gender equality. We encourage using the Index as a strategic guide for politicians in planning appropriate policy measures. We can see that the country has plenty of room for improvement in all domains, just as the EU countries. However, the high score in the domain of power certainly deserves recognition,\u201d said Virginija Langbakk, the Director of the European Institute for Gender Equality. North Macedonia earns its high score in the domain of power by having a high number of women members in the parliament, supported by a 17-year-old gender quota. There is also a solid representation of women in decision-making positions in research funding organisations and national broadcasting institutions. \u00a0\u201cThe first national Gender Equality Index presents an opportunity to reaffirm the commitment and dedication of the Republic of North Macedonia to promoting gender equality and equal opportunities. Women and men must have equal access to opportunities and services planned and created in compliance with their specific needs. The status of women in our society demands not only promises, but also progress and a clearly defined approach, since that is what both the national standards and the real needs of women oblige us to achieve,\u201d noted Jovana Trenchevska, State Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy. North Macedonia is the second of the EU candidate countries and potential candidates, after Serbia, to develop a Gender Equality Index. With more regional Indices available, the Western Balkan countries and Turkey will be able to compare their performance within the region and to learn from each other. EIGE supported the development of the Index for North Macedonia, in cooperation with the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy and its Department for Equal Opportunities, the State Statistical Office and the UN Women Office in Skopje. The Gender Equality Index in North Macedonia was developed under the EU Instrument of Pre-Accession (IPA) and was funded by the European Union.

The latest Gender Equality Index from the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) shows that the EU\u2019s score for gender equality is up just one point to 67.4, since the 2017 edition. Sweden continues to top the EU scoreboard, with 83.6 points, followed by Denmark with 77.5. Greece and Hungary have the most ground to make up, with both scoring less than 52. The biggest improver is Portugal, with an increase of 3.9 points, followed closely by Estonia with 3.1 points. \u201cWe are moving in the right direction but we are still far from the finish line. Our Index, which sets a benchmark for gender equality in the EU, shows that almost half of all Member States fall below the 60 point mark. As the new EU Parliament and Commission shape and renew EU priorities for the next strategic framework, it is crucial that gender equality gathers speed,\u201d said Virginija Langbakk, Director of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). The lowest scoring domain is power, which looks at equality in decision-making. Yet, it is the area with the biggest progress. This has been mainly driven by the rise of women on company boards, although in just a few Member States. France is the only one to have at least 40 % of each gender on the boards of publicly listed companies. \u201cGender inequality is holding Europe back from reaching its full potential. I am proud of what we have achieved, however now our actions need to make a difference on the ground. Our Work-Life Balance Directive adopted this year will be a game-changer for women and men across Europe. The rules will support more equal sharing of caring responsibilities, which will allow women to stay on the labour market and take on challenging roles or management positions,\u201d said V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. Focus on work-life balance Work-life balance and its connection to gender equality is a special focus of this year\u2019s Index. Parental leave is one of the important policy measures to support parents who balance caring duties with work but it is not available to all. In the EU, 28 % of women and 20 % of men are ineligible for parental leave. Access to affordable and good quality childcare services is important for work-life balance, but it is not only children who need looking after. Ageing and disability rates are rising in the EU, which pushes up demand for long-term care services for older people and people with disabilities. Women of pre-retirement age do the bulk of informal long-term caring in the EU. The difference is remarkable in the 50-64 age group: 21\u00a0% of women and 11\u00a0% of men care for older people and/or people with disabilities at least several days a week. As part of the work-life balance analysis, the Index also examined whether women and men have the same opportunities to work flexibly, to attend training courses, to use transport and commute. An important pillar of work-life balance is flexible working arrangements. EIGE\u2019s work-life balance scoreboard presents the different options people have to balance their work and personal life. It shows whether these options are equally available to women and men and it gives new ideas for monitoring the European Pillar of Social Rights and its Work-Life Balance Initiative.

They are all examples of gender-discriminatory, even sexist language. They imply that all police officers are men and that a woman lawyer is an exception. And a \u2018ladylike\u2019 handshake is usually used as an insult.\u00a0 These expressions reflect unconscious bias and enforce gender stereotypes. To help you use language and images which are modern, inclusive and treat people with respect, EIGE has developed a gender-sensitive communication toolkit, including a booklet and interactive online tool. Both come with numerous practical examples and suggestions for alternative words. You are bound to notice how deeply embedded certain gender stereotypes continue to be. EIGE\u2019s toolkit also outlines why gender-sensitive communication is better at highlighting the different needs of women and men and preferable to gender-neutral communication. It can be especially useful for legislators, public figures and the media: a gender-sensitive text on reported cases of sexual violence, for example, presents the figures for women and men separately. This gives a more accurate picture of the reality and helps policymakers design suitable responses. Gender-sensitive communication ensures that women and men \u2013 and those who do not conform to the binary gender system \u2013 are treated as persons of equal importance and dignity. It helps you avoid trivialising others and stay away from gender stereotypes. It is gender equality made manifest through communication.

The Index will explore the diverse ways women and men juggle work and personal commitments, especially when they have to care for young children, older relatives or family members with a disability. We will look into who benefits most from flexible working arrangements and whether they help or hinder work-life balance. Parental leave will also be scrutinised. Are mothers and fathers equally eligible for it? What are the conditions in different EU countries? EIGE will also examine life-long learning as a dimension of work-life balance.

Today, women across the EU earn on average, 16% less per hour than men. The biggest gap in earnings is among couples with children - showing that the financial cost of having a family falls heavily on women\u2019s shoulders. These findings are from a new report published today by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). \u201cWomen are using flexible work arrangements to juggle work and family life but this is rarely the case for men. Our report shows that work-life balance initiatives can help to boost women\u2019s employment and close the gender pay gap, but only if both women and men have support from their employers to take advantage of these measures,\u201d said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s director. The gender pay gap is a result of many factors: women are concentrated in lower level and lower paid jobs, work more (both paid and unpaid) hours, take longer career breaks, and are more likely to choose part-time work to reconcile work and care responsibilities. The price to pay is high: in the EU, women\u2019s pensions end up being 37% less than men\u2019s. \u201cWe must get rid of gender stereotypes that underpin the pay gap, starting with the uneven concentration of women and men in the labour market. Women dominate fields that are less valued and lower paid, such as education or care work. At the same time, women are less likely to be in top management roles and this needs to change,\u201d said Ms Langbakk. Even higher education does not protect women from earning less. Women with a tertiary degree face a higher pay gap of 25%. As they move up the career ladder, the pay gap widens. The European Union is committed to ensure a better work-life balance for its citizens and reduce the gender pay gap. The European Commission\u2019s Proposal for a Directive on Work-Life Balance for Parents and Carers aims to improve access to parental leave and flexible working, as well as increase the take up of these arrangements by men. The EU Action Plan, designed to reduce the gender pay gap includes a variety of policy options to combat pay inequalities. These include equal pay for equal work, getting more women into top-level management positions and encouraging companies to attract and retain women or men into jobs where they are underrepresented.

EU funds have helped transform less-developed regions and reduced inequality across the European Union. Yet a new report by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) has estimated that less than 1% of the EU\u2019s Structural and Investment Funds have been set aside for the promotion of gender equality, with gender mainstreaming treated as a theme that has little impact on the actual content of funding programmes. Proposals for the post-2020 budget \u2013 the EU\u2019s Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) \u2013 display an even lower level of ambition. This is despite the EU\u2019s legal obligations and political commitments to close the gender gap, which persists across all member states. \u201cAs the EU puts together its \u2018budget for the future\u2019, \u00a0we put forward our proposals for how to ensure the next MFF serves the future of the whole population. Currently women earn less, spend more time on caring and housework, and end up with significantly lower pensions than men. Funding programmes are the most direct way for EU resources to reach those who need them and to impact individual lives \u2013 gender budgeting would ensure women and men are able to benefit equally,\u201d said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s Director. Gender budgeting is a tool that helps identify the different situation and needs of women and men and allocates resources accordingly. This can include recognising women\u2019s unpaid work: across the EU, more than a third of women care for family members on a daily basis, while almost 80% cook or do housework. This leads to fewer women than men in full-time employment and a lifetime gender gap in earnings of some 40%. Budgets that invest in public services such as transport and childcare can help offset such inequalities. The report \u2018Gender budgeting: Mainstreaming gender into the EU budget and macroeconomic policy framework\u2019 outlines in detail how the EU institutions and member states can help realise the goal of gender equality through improved gender budgeting. Recommendations include: The setting of gender equality as a priority across the entire MFF The institutionalisation of gender mainstreaming methods and the monitoring of its impact in all funds The setting of budgetary targets for gender equality The introduction of a system to track funding for gender equality in all funding programmes. EIGE\u2019s research shows that narrowing the gender gap in the EU could result in an extra 10 million jobs and an increase in GDP of up to \u20ac3.15 trillion by 2050.

With the domain of power holding the lowest score in our Gender Equality Index, women remain under-represented in the kinds of decision-making positions that shape politics, economics and society.\u00a0 Yet gender equality is a founding value of the EU and improving it could lead to an increase in GDP of up to \u20ac3.15 trillion by 2050. The share of women in parliament in the 28 EU member states has increased from 21% to 30%. Yet 89% of country leaders remain men and less than one in five of the EU\u2019s major political parties is led by a woman. In the private sector, almost three quarters of those sitting on corporate boards are men. A lack of women in decision-making positions is reflected in the failure to recognise people\u2019s diverse needs across public policy in the EU. Lifetime inequalities in pay and employment lead to an overall gender gap in earnings of some 40%. The public transport routes most commonly taken by women are often the most unreliable and likely to be discontinued. In academia men dominate decision-making positions and women\u2019s research is under-valued and under-funded. The digital tools that will increasingly make up our reality are also being designed without the input of women \u2013 currently some 83% of ICT professionals in the EU are men. The digital world can also be more hostile to young women, who are more likely to face online harassment than young men and subsequently hesitate to engage in political debates on social media. In May 2019, voters across the EU will go to the polls to elect the next European Parliament, where the share of women parliamentarians has more than doubled from 17% in 1979, when elections were first held, to 36% today. Yet the European Commission has still to be headed by a woman and the most senior - and best paid - civil servant jobs continue to be dominated by men. \u00a0 Legislative action can help bring more women into decision-making positions. Out of the nine EU member states that have introduced quotas, eight have seen an increase in the share of women in parliament. Improving opportunities for work-life balance in the workplace, such as turning a former parliamentary shooting gallery into a nursery, can also have a positive effect. The President of the 1979 European Parliament, sitting in a chamber made up of 83% men, \u00a0requested that as a woman \u201cmy difference be taken into account so that I am not forced to adapt to a male model.\u201d Bringing more women into decision-making positions would enable the EU to use all the resources at its disposal and help ensure everybody, regardless of gender, is able to help shape society.\u00a0 For more information, please contact Veronica Collins,\u00a0phone +370 5 2157 449,\u00a0veronica.collins@eige.europa.eu Further information Statement by the European Commission on the occasion of International Women's Day 2019 Gender Statistics Database: Women and men in decision-making Fact sheet on gender equality in political decision-making Gender Equality Index: Power Toolkit: Is your parliament gender-sensitive?

The fine-tuned methodology will assist those responsible for carrying out risk estimations of female genital mutilation in a region or country of the EU. \u201cFemale genital mutilation (FGM) is illegal in all countries of the European Union but this does not mean that all girls are safe. EIGE has developed a new guide as part of its ongoing work to help Member States monitor the risk of FGM in their country and check if policies to combat the practice are working. We hope that this will guide national authorities in their efforts to end the practice,\u201d said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s Director.\u00a0 EIGE\u2019s unique methodology has 14 concrete steps that combines data and information gained from real life testimonials. Using both quantitative and qualitative elements gives a more accurate and comprehensive picture than using data alone. The updated guide builds on EIGE\u2019s previous methodology, which was refined during recent research to estimate the risk of female genital mutilation in Belgium, Greece, France, Italy, Cyprus and Malta. The results showed that communities are starting to change their attitudes and turn away from female genital mutilation. Strong laws combined with a tough stance on prosecution are powerful deterrents, especially when family members know about the legal consequences. Awareness raising campaigns on the damaging effects on mental, sexual, and reproductive health also play a role in changing people\u2019s attitudes towards the practice. By offering a common framework to estimate FGM risk in the EU, EIGE wants to help Member States eliminate the practice and contribute to the production of comparable and up\u2011to\u2011date data across the EU. The European Union is strongly committed to eliminating female genital mutilation. Read more about the Commission\u2019s activities to end FGM in this statement and MEMO.

The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) highlights these findings ahead of the international day to eliminate female genital mutilation on 6 February. \u201cIt is hard to imagine and to accept that today some girls in the EU are still threatened by one of the most horrible forms of violence. When girls return to the family\u2019s home country this risk becomes real because of the social pressure from relatives to undergo the practice, particularly in rural areas. Strong laws, combined with timely and tough prosecution measures are powerful deterrents and should also protect the girls when the crime is committed abroad,\u201d said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s Director. Malta was one of the six countries for which EIGE estimated the risk of female genital mutilation. The other countries include Belgium, Greece, France, Italy and Cyprus. The percentage of girls at risk in Malta is the highest among the countries studied. This is because a large part of the female migrant population are young girls originating from countries with a high occurrence of female genital mutilation. The percentage of girls at risk reflects the number of first and second-generation girls from FGM-practising countries. In Malta\u2019s case, girls at risk mostly originate from Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Egypt, Sudan, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. \u00a0 \u201cMalta is committed to ending female genital mutilation. Through the ratification of the Istanbul Convention, we have strengthened the legal framework against the practice. There is a law in place to criminalise the practice, as well as those failing to report potential or known cases of female genital mutilation to the authorities. With the principle of extraterritoriality in force, we aim to ensure that if female genital mutilation is done to girls when they go abroad, the crime will be prosecuted in Malta,\u2019\u2019 said Dr Helena Dalli, Minister for European Affairs and Equality. Despite girls continuing to be at risk in the EU, research from focus group discussions showed that communities are starting to turn away from the practice as a result of integration and domestic laws. In Malta, most Nigerians interviewed were against the practice, with many stressing that female genital mutilation is not part of their identity. The participants emphasised that education and awareness-raising on laws against FGM and accompanying health risks are essential for change. Initiatives to engage men for change were also cited as important, as men were widely regarded as the final decision-makers in FGM-related matters. As migration to the EU from FGM-practising countries continues, it is crucial that Member States deal with new arrivals in a gender-sensitive way. This can include the provision of women interpreters and specialised referral and care upon arrival. One of EIGE\u2019s key recommendations to Member States is to consider the risk of female genital mutilation as grounds for asylum. EIGE aims to increase knowledge and comparable data on female genital mutilation in the EU. The results of this study complement EIGE\u2019s previous risk estimations of female genital mutilation in Ireland, Portugal and Sweden. The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) is the EU knowledge centre on gender equality. EIGE supports policymakers and all relevant institutions in their efforts to make equality between women and men a reality. It provides specific expertise and comparable and reliable data on gender equality in Europe.

EIGE has developed a detailed guide to help EU institutions and governmental bodies incorporate a gender perspective into each stage of the policy cycle. \u201cWhen designing policies that will affect large groups of people, it is important to bear in mind that they will have a different impact depending on people\u2019s situation. Our gender mainstreaming methods and tools are designed to help policymakers ensure women and men\u2019s diverse needs are made visible and addressed by those legislating in their behalf,\u201d said Barbara Limanowska, EIGE Gender Mainstreaming Programme Coordinator. EIGE\u2019s four new briefing papers provide detailed explanations of gender mainstreaming methods and tools: \u00a0 Gender analysis: looks at the current situation of women and men in society through the collection of data and tries to find out the reasons behind existing inequalities. This includes an examination of the allocation of resources between women and men and the different barriers they face in their everyday lives. \u00a0 Gender planning: recognises that women and men have different needs and that policies and budgets should to be planned accordingly. For example rectifying the fact that the public transport routes most commonly taken by women are often the most unreliable and most likely to be discontinued. Gender stakeholder consultation: puts citizens at the heart of policymaking through getting their input into legislation. Hearing first-hand how policies impact women and men differently helps policymakers design gender-sensitive legislation and enhances accountability.\u00a0 \u00a0 Gender awareness raising: uses evidence to build public support and political will for gender-equality initiatives. For example highlighting the fact that improving gender equality in the EU could lead to an increase in\u00a0GDP of up to \u20ac3.15 trillion by 2050. EIGE\u2019s Gender Mainstreaming Platform has been designed to help policymakers address the different needs of women and men in their work. From collecting sex-disaggregated data to building political support for gender equality initiatives, EIGE explains what gender mainstreaming is and how it can help build a more equal society. This includes 15 methods and tools which offer clear guidance on how to integrate gender through the content of policies and increase women\u2019s representation in different areas of society. Background information \u00a0 What is Gender Mainstreaming? Gender mainstreaming has been a global strategy to advance gender equality since the Beijing Platform for Action was adopted in 1995.

They are confronted with more obstacles than women without disabilities and face more challenges than their male peers. They are less likely to have a university degree, work outside the home and they experience a higher risk of poverty. Due to gender stereotypes, the bulk of caring responsibilities and housework often falls on their shoulders. These are some of the findings from EIGE\u2019s Gender Equality Index that analyses gender equality among and between different groups of people. \u201cTo build a more inclusive Europe, gender equality needs to reach everyone. Barriers to education, employment and health services for persons with disabilities must be removed,\u201d said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s director in the lead up to the international day of persons with disabilities. Accessing education is more difficult for persons with disabilities. Only 13 % of women with disabilities have a tertiary degree, compared to 29 % of women without disabilities. Men with disabilities (17 %) are also less likely to have graduated from tertiary education than men without disabilities (27 %). Another matter of concern is the school dropout rate of youth with disabilities (22.5 %), which is double the rate of students without disabilities (11 %). Dropping out of school early indicates potential difficulties in accessing suitable educational programmes and a need to adjust teaching methods. In homes across the EU, women do the bulk of the cooking, household tasks and care work. This situation is mirrored among persons with disabilities. Eight in ten women with disabilities (79 %) are cooking and cleaning every day, compared to four in ten men with disabilities (41 %). Almost a third of women with disabilities (29 %) and a fifth of men with disabilities (20 %) care daily for someone, whether it be children, older people or adults with disabilities. This is despite the fact that persons with disabilities also need care themselves. \u00a0These factors make it harder for women to engage in paid work outside the home. Low participation in the workforce is a reality for both women and men with disabilities but women face a double disadvantage. Their rate of full-time employment*\u00a0(19 %) is less than half that of women without disabilities (47 %) and also lower than that of men with disabilities (28 %). This increases their risk of poverty, which is 21 % compared to 16 % for women without disabilities. European policies need to be based on the different needs of citizens and incorporate a cross-cutting perspective. Integrating a gender perspective into disability strategies would help ensure that the different challenges faced by women and men with disabilities are recognised and taken into account. Background information EIGE\u2019s Gender Equality Index is a tool to measure gender equality in the EU and monitor its progress over time. It also looks at how different factors influence a person\u2019s opportunities in life, such as their age, ethnicity, disability and more. The Index measures gender equality in \u00a0six core domains (work, money, knowledge, time, power and health). All domains include an intersectional analysis. Violence is measured in a separate satellite domain.

Only one in three women (33 %) who are physically or sexually abused by their partner contact the authorities. Reported figures of intimate partner violence conceal how widespread it really is. In the lead up to the international day for the elimination of violence against women on 25 November, the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) is launching its new study to improve data collection\u00a0by the police and justice sectors on intimate partner violence. \u201cData from police and the judiciary is a valuable source of information on violence against women. It can help Member States check if their actions to prevent violence, protect victims and punish perpetrators are working and help them design more effective measures in the future. However, it is crucial that trust in police is raised to encourage more women to come forward and report cases of violence,\u201d\u00a0said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s director. \u201cThe EU is one of the best places for women to thrive, but still too many are victims of violence and discrimination. We can't and we won't stay idle. That's why the EU is acting to improve support and protection for victims. Together with EU governments and assistance from EIGE, we must work hard to end violence against women. It does not belong in the 21st century,\" said V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality.\u00a0 As it currently stands in the EU, there are several factors restricting the collection of comparable, high quality data on intimate partner violence, underreporting being just one of them. Different legal definitions of violence related crimes make it impossible to compare data across Member States. In addition, some forms of violence do not get registered as crimes and not all complaints are recorded electronically or in a way that helps to understand the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator. There is room to improve data collection processes in all Member States. A strong commitment from law enforcement agencies to collect more comparable data on intimate partner violence and make it available is essential for such a change to happen. In terms of legal improvements, intimate partner violence should be recognised as a specific crime, separate from domestic violence. Having a specific offence for intimate partner violence means that women who do not live with their partner and/or are not married or in a formal partnership would also be protected under this offence. From this evening, Europe House, the President\u2019s Palace, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\u00a0the French embassy and the White Bridge in Vilnius will be lit up in orange in support of the \u201816 days of activism against gender-based violence' campaign. The European Commission's headquarters in Brussels will also be lit in orange this Saturday and Sunday evening. The official campaign begins on 25 November and runs until 10 December. Background information To help Member States improve the quality, availability and comparability of data on intimate partner violence collected by the police and justice sectors, EIGE has developed country-specific recommendations. These are based on an analysis of the situation in each EU Member State. In addition country factsheets were also prepared for each country. Find them here. Two factsheets explaining the role of the police and the judiciary in collecting administrative data have also been developed. Thirteen indicators have been proposed for the police and justice sectors to uniform data collection across the EU and assist Member States with their reporting obligations under the Victims\u2019 Rights Directive and Istanbul Convention. To strengthen the efforts at the European level, policy and technical recommendations for Eurostat have been proposed.\u00a0 The main and technical reports will be published in 2019.

It is a form of gender-based violence that disproportionately affects women. 95% of registered victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation in the EU are women or girls. Trafficking in women and girls remains a structural form of violence against women. Member States are obliged by law to take gender specific measures to assist and protect victims. In the lead up to the EU Anti-Trafficking day on 18 October, the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) has published a report on the matter. \u201cOur research shows that trafficking for sexual exploitation is rooted in gender inequalities. Anti-trafficking efforts cannot and must not overlook the gender-specific roots of this crime, which make women and girls more vulnerable to trafficking,\u201d said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s director. \u201cWomen and girls make up the majority of reported victims of trafficking and continue to be disproportionately affected. This report forms part of a new set of priority actions presented by the Commission in December 2017, and reflects the commitments agreed in the Joint Statement signed by the Heads of ten EU Agencies last June.

The Institute, in cooperation with the European Commission, has developed gender and child specific recommendations to help Member States implement the directives and monitor their progress. Both directives need to be implemented in complementarity in order to maximise their potential to protect. National strategies to address trafficking for sexual exploitation should also be included in a broader national strategy to combat gender-based violence.

From receiving instant news notifications on political developments, to engaging in online debates and expressing opinions on social media, political and civic participation has become faster and easier. Yet, one of the downsides experienced by this generation, who is the most digitally skilled in the EU, is the risk of online abuse. These are some of the findings published today by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). The study was prepared at the request of the Austrian Presidency of the Council of the EU. \u201cDigital spaces can be empowering places of opinion-formation, debate and mobilisation. However, cyberbullying restricts the opportunities offered by digitalisation. Young people, especially women are put off from taking part in political discussions or online debates. All of society is missing out when young women are not engaged because we are losing their potential to get involved in politics and become future leaders,\u201d said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s Director.\u00a0 Online harassment happens more often to young women, with 9 % declaring to be a victim, compared with 6 % of young men. After witnessing or experiencing online hate speech or abuse, one young woman out of two (51 %) and 42 % of young men hesitate to engage in social media debates. \u201cThe internet needs to be a safe place to enable young people to express their opinions. Cyber bullying or abuse has to be prevented if we want to ensure the full online participation of youth, especially young women, whose voices are less heard,\u201c said Juliane Bogner-Strauss, Austrian Minister for Women, Families and Youth. Young men are more politically active online, with 26 % posting comments on online articles, social networks or blogs, compared to 18 % of young women. Young men, more than young women, see the benefits that social media brings for political participation. Just over half (51\u00a0%) of young men and under half (47\u00a0%) of young women think that online social networks represent progress for democracy because they give everyone a chance to contribute to public debate. In light of the upcoming European Parliament elections in May 2019, it is important to encourage young women and men to use digital technology to grow into active European citizens by becoming informed on important topics, engaging in online debates and making their opinions count. Further information The report Gender equality and youth: opportunities and risks of digitalisation (forthcoming) was prepared at the request of the Austrian presidency. It explores how digital technologies can be used to promote gender equality and what are the gender-related risks of digitalisation for young women and men.

They give an in-depth analysis of how each country in the EU is doing in gender equality. You can see how your country has progressed over time and learn about the greatest improvements and challenges in each of the six domains: health, power, money, work, knowledge and time. The EU\u2019s score for gender equality is currently 66.2 out of 100 and only 11 countries rank higher. Across the EU, all countries have room to improve and while some have moved forwards, others have slipped backwards.\u00a0 Certain countries perform better in specific areas. For example Denmark tops the knowledge domain but when it comes to money, Luxembourg reigns. The Index gives Member States the opportunity to see what\u2019s working best in other countries and learn from each other\u2019s initiatives and policies. The results of this edition of the Index show gaps among different groups of women and men. Depending on a person\u2019s age, education, country of birth, disability and family type, their life can be completely different to the rest of the population. For example, in the Czech Republic, only 9 % of women with disabilities have a tertiary degree, compared to 19 % of women without disabilities and in the Netherlands, 28 % of lone mothers are at risk of poverty compared to 4 % of lone fathers.

Between 25 % to 42 % of girls from FGM-practising countries living in Greece are at risk of female genital mutilation. These are the findings released today by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). \u201cFemale genital mutilation is a problem for the EU and we cannot close our eyes to it. A major risk factor is girls returning to the home country because social pressure from relatives to have the practice done is still strong, particularly in rural areas. Strong laws, combined with a tough approach towards prosecution, even when the crime is committed abroad are powerful deterrent factors,\u201d said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s Director. Greece was one of the six countries where EIGE estimated the risk of female genital mutilation. The other countries include Belgium, France, Italy, Cyprus and Malta. Numbers of girls at risk range from 44,106 in France to 132 in Cyprus. These figures reflect the latest number of first and second-generation girls from FGM-practising countries, such as Egypt, Guinea and Somalia, who are living in the EU Member States. Although levels of risk have slightly decreased since 2011, the number of girls at risk of female genital mutilation is on the rise in Belgium and France, due to a growing number of second-generation girls. \u201cIt is unacceptable that in the 21st century there are a number of girls in Greece who are at risk of female genital mutilation. With the ratification of the Istanbul Convention, we intend to put an end to it. The principle of extraterritoriality will ensure that if female genital mutilation is done to girls when they go abroad, the crime will be prosecuted in Greece. It is also against the law for anyone to encourage the practice, either in private or in public,\u201d said Fotini Kouvela, Greek Secretary General for Gender Equality. Despite a number of girls at risk, the research shows that communities are starting to turn away from the practice because of integration efforts and laws. In Greece, young women from second generations, especially from Egypt, Nigeria, Somalia and Sudan feel less tied to the practice and have strong opinions against it. When migrants from FGM-practising countries move to Europe, they gain new information about the practice, such as the laws against it and the damaging effects on sexual and reproductive health. With migration to the EU from FGM-practising countries ongoing, it is crucial that Member States deal with new arrivals in a gender-sensitive way. From 2011 to 2016, the number of asylum-seeking girls from FGM-practising countries to Greece grew from ten to 1,123. Around 5 % of these girls are at risk of female genital mutilation. Governments are recommended to implement gender-specific asylum procedures, even if they introduce fast-track border procedures for arrivals. Such provisions can help prevent female genital mutilation. For example, protecting victims at entry points and reception centres, ensuring gender-sensitive risk assessment upon arrival and onward specialised referral and care. EIGE aims to increase knowledge and data on female genital mutilation in the EU. These results complement EIGE\u2019s previous risk estimations of female genital mutilation in Ireland, Portugal and Sweden.

Despite a number of girls at risk, the research shows that communities are starting to turn away from the practice because of integration efforts and laws.

With migration to the EU from FGM-practising countries ongoing, it is crucial that Member States deal with new arrivals in a gender-sensitive way.

We acknowledge that trafficking in human beings is: a grave violation of fundamental rights, explicitly prohibited by Article 5(3) of the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights; \u00a0a demand-driven, highly profitable form of transnational organised crime and a major threat within the EU and beyond; \u00a0a phenomenon where women and girls are disproportionally affected; We further recognise that: \u00a0Perpetrators and abusers target victims for the purpose of sexual and labour exploitation, forced criminal activities, forced begging, forced marriage, and more; There are substantially more victims of trafficking in human beings than those covered by official figures, not all of whom are identified and provided appropriate assistance and protection; \u00a0Children are particularly vulnerable; Trafficking in human beings is linked to multiple other crimes. Drugs may also play a part in the human trafficking process, facilitating the exploitation of the victims. An enhanced multiagency approach remains crucial to contribute to addressing this complex phenomenon in a coordinated, coherent and comprehensive manner, in partnership with the EU Member States, EU institutions and other relevant partners. Thus, building on the progress made in the past years, we commit to: \u00a0countering the culture of impunity for perpetrators, abusers and exploiters; \u00a0enhancing our focus on prevention, taking into account the whole trafficking chain not only within but equally outside the EU; \u00a0ensuring a gender-specific and child-sensitive approach in addressing this crime. \u00a0assisting Member States in improving early identification of victims and ensuring access to and realisation of their rights; \u00a0addressing the vulnerabilities of the victims and ensuring accountability towards them, including in border management; \u00a0enhancing effectiveness of investigations and prosecutions, including by setting up Joint Investigation Teams, and promoting cross border, as well as internal, law enforcement and judicial cooperation; \u00a0strengthen training activities, sharing of good practices and capacity building within an appropriate policy context; \u00a0building on synergies foreseen in relevant EU instruments in specific areas, including with respect to the EU action on drugs; \u00a0improving information sharing, including through the use of technology, within the limits of data protection rules, proactive financial and intelligence-led investigations, asset recovery, freezing and confiscation of profits; implementing and developing large-scale IT systems and leveraging systems interoperability; \u00a0supporting coherent and effective joint activities with all relevant stakeholders including labour market intermediaries and recruitment agencies; \u00a0increasing regional and cross-border cooperation amongst public authorities and social partners; Contact points are to be nominated by each Agency whose tasks will include participating in the meetings organised by the Office of the EU Anti-trafficking Coordinator; ensuring an overview of the Agency\u2019s action in this field and represent the Agency in the relevant fora as appropriate; creating synergies and avoiding duplication of efforts.

With the current speed, it will take almost twenty years to achieve gender-balanced national parliaments. EIGE\u2019s new online tool gives ideas on needed changes. It helps to identify where parliaments stand on their way to gender equality and proposes steps for every parliament to improve. We call it the gender-sensitive parliaments tool. \u201cDemocracy works best when decision-making power is equally shared by women and men. An active inclusion of women has many positive effects on society contributing this way to the improvement of citizens\u2019 lives. As symbols of democracy, parliaments must set an example and our tool can help them in doing that,\u201d says Virginija Langbakk, Director of EIGE. What makes a parliament gender-sensitive? Having a higher share of women is not the only touchstone. EIGE\u2019s tool helps to see beyond bare numbers. A truly gender-sensitive parliament is committed to equality from its core. It encourages women to choose a career in politics and welcomes their rise to the top levels of decision-making. It fosters a culture of respect for women and their right to have an equal influence. Parliamentary decisions are an equally important element. An exemplary parliament adjusts measures to reflect the needs of both women and men when passing a law. Are you now wondering how gender-sensitive your parliament is? You can test it yourself with the \u2018general\u2019 version of EIGE\u2019s tool. You do not need to register, just collect and fill in the facts and you will get an assessment. The results give a good basis for advocating for gender equality in parliaments and within political parties. Representatives of the parliaments have access to a more extensive analysis. They can sign-up to the tool and carry out a self-assessment. This way they can see where their parliament is doing well and what needs improvement. The assessment can be repeated later to monitor changes and see what works best. To make your work easier the tool already presents initial data from your parliament. It is synchronised with our gender statistics database, which has statistics on women in parliamentary bureaus and committees in the national parliaments of all the Member States. This tool is also relevant for the upcoming elections to the European Parliament. With women currently accounting for 36.8% of the members, there is clearly room for improvement.

We are working closely with EU candidates and potential candidates to make gender equality more visible in the region. Our focus is on improving the monitoring of gender equality in public policies, legislation and practice. EIGE has worked with the Western Balkans and Turkey since 2013. On their way towards EU membership, EU candidates and potential candidates need to incorporate a gender perspective into their policy-making, following EU requirements. This includes improving the collection of gender statistics and especially data on gender-based violence and the protection of victims, in line with the implementation of the Istanbul convention. EIGE provides technical expertise to the Western Balkans and Turkey to support these changes. This year, EIGE is helping with the development of national Gender Equality Indices in the region. Serbia was the first among IPA countries to develop and\u00a0launch its Gender Equality Index in 2016. It is the first non-EU country to replicate EIGE\u2019s Index, enabling a comparison with the EU and its Member States. Our main collaboration partners are the national gender equality and statistical bodies and in the region. The European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Neighborhood and Enlargement Negotiations (DG NEAR) funds the project.

Still, more than eight out of ten ICT jobs go to men. To mark International Women\u2019s Day, the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) focuses on ways to tap women\u2019s potential in this growing sector. \u201cDeep-rooted stereotypes are one of the main obstacles for women\u2019s careers in the ICT sector. At an early age, girls learn to consider boys better at learning digital skills. Later in life, they look for career options elsewhere and overlook the benefits of having a job in tech. If we do not break these stereotypes, the EU will keep wasting potential talent,\u201d says Virginija Langbakk, Director of EIGE. Research shows that a mere 17 % of ICT specialists in the EU are women. Due to the stereotypes in early education, barely any teenage girls consider a future in tech. This trend threatens to widen gender segregation even more. This is a real problem for Europe. ICT already suffers from a shortage of digital skills and therefore cannot boost the EU economy to its full potential. With more women on board, this would not be the case.\u00a0 How could the digital sector attract more women? One less-known factor is the favourable approach to work-life balance. Taking a few hours off from work during the day is usually not a problem, working late or very early is not common. Almost 90 % of employees in ICT appreciate their working time arrangements. The pay gap between women and men is also lower than in most other sectors. EIGE\u2019s forthcoming research on Women in ICT also reveals some less attractive sides of the sector, which need addressing. The seemingly different \u201cgame\u201d rules for women and men is a worrying trend. The statistics show that women in tech jobs are more educated than men, but still end up in lower positions. Another challenge is the need for continuous upscaling of skills, which is a prerequisite for a successful career in the ICT sector. This can be difficult for women, who still tend to take a lion\u2019s share of household and care responsibilities and therefore do not have time to engage in trainings outside office hours. An equal sharing of home responsibilities would therefore have a positive impact on women\u2019s careers. \u201cThere is clearly work to be done in the ICT sector and the way to start is with good practices and policies. We have identified some examples on introducing work-life balance to tech companies and on attracting women to ICT. We have also developed guidelines for companies to advance the work-life balance of their employees. This is our contribution to help policy-makers take targeted actions in line with EU\u2019s Directive on Work-Life Balance for Parents and Carers,\u201d says Virginija Langbakk.

Family members fear the consequences of the law more than the consequences of not having it done. However, in order for the laws to work, police and justice must enforce them and prosecute those responsible for their crime. These are some preliminary findings from an upcoming study by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). \u201cOur research shows how important a strong legal framework is for the prevention of female genital mutilation. However, simply having a law in place is not enough. Training for people implementing the law is vital, combined with awareness raising of the legislation amongst the communities involved\u201d, said Virginija Langbakk, Director of EIGE, ahead of the international day of zero tolerance for female genital mutilation In recent years, the legal framework against the practice has strengthened, partly due to the introduction of the Istanbul Convention, which recognises that female genital mutilation exists in Europe. So far, 16 out of 28 EU Member States have ratified it, while the European Union has signed it. Awareness campaigns are the other crucial element to ending female genital mutilation. EIGE\u2019s research found that when people were more aware of the legal and health consequences, they were less likely to practice it. Among communities who are unaware of the law, there is a greater risk of it happening. Involvement of these communities is essential for efforts to end the practice to be successful.\u00a0 In the EU today, women from FGM-practicing countries continue to seek asylum. It is important that professionals (for example, immigration officers, health practitioners and teachers) who are in contact with women asylum seekers from these countries are properly trained to notice and assess the potential risk of female genital mutilation. These people are in a good positon to spot women and girls at risk and provide support to those who have already undergone the practice. EIGE aims to increase knowledge and data on female genital mutilation in the EU. The research will further complete the picture of the risk of FGM by adding comparable data from six Member States (Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, France, Italy and Malta) to previously conducted risk estimations (Ireland, Portugal, Sweden and Germany). To gain a better understanding about female genital mutilation, in 2017 EIGE conducted 24 focus group discussions with first and second-generation women and men originating from FGM practicing countries who reside in the EU. The complete study results will be published later this year.

We also aim to highlight the human dimension in all other areas of the network and to bring to the surface the crucial differences of how they affect women and men\u201d, says Virginija Langbakk, Director of EIGE. The JHA network has an important role to play in Europe. The work of the nine agencies helps ensure that the EU is well equipped to deal with security, justice, fundamental rights and gender equality. The agencies work on a wide range of important areas, including migration and border management, drug trafficking and combating organised crime and human trafficking. Since these areas have a lot in common, the network was established to make use of the synergies and share information. The network has also taken a strong stance to demonstrate their shared values. In 2017, the heads of the JHA agencies signed a joint statement on zero tolerance for sexual harassment.

We cannot and will not accept harassment of any form in our agencies and we take it upon ourselves to communicate to our staff that harassment in the workplace is never acceptable. Equality is one of the fundamental values on which the European Union is built. Gender-based violence, including sexual harassment, is one of the most extreme manifestations of inequality and discrimination. Sexual violence and harassment contradict the principle of gender equality and equal treatment. They constitute gender-based discrimination in employment. Cases of sexual harassment and bullying, while significantly underreported, are a matter of health, safety and well-being in the workplace and need to be responded to effectively and in accordance with existing laws.\u00a0 Heads of JHA agencies: Jos\u00e8 Carreira, European Asylum Support Office (EASO); Krum Garkov, European Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA); Alexis Goosdeel, European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA); Ladislav Hamran, European Union\u2019s Judicial Cooperation Unit (EUROJUST); Virginija Langbakk, European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE); Fabrice Leggeri, European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex); Michael O\u2019Flaherty, European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA); Detlef Schroeder, European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL); Rob Wainwright, European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (EUROPOL).

White Ribbon is one of the world\u2019s largest male-led campaigns to end violence against women, and is now active in many countries across the globe. The European Union has a number of decentralised agencies to carry out specific legal, technical or scientific tasks within the EU. These agencies are independent and provide added value by helping to implement policies, enhancing dialogue and sharing information and expertise. EU agencies also provide practical support to Member States and the EU institutions. More information on the JHA agencies\u2019 network can be found in this publication. More information on the White Ribbon Campaign can be found on EIGE's website. Already in 2015 the EU agencies recognised the importance of addressing the issue of harassment and discrimination in the workplace, and committed themselves to promote diversity at work and provide its staff with a trusted place to turn to.

This makes the labour market less competitive and companies struggle to find qualified professionals in growing sectors, such as information and communications technology (ICT) and health or personal care. Gender segregation poses challenges for these industries and leads to a reduced talent pool, untapped potential and unfulfilled career aspirations. Women make up less than 20 % of ICT graduates in the EU, a figure that has been declining in recent years. Despite labour shortages in the sector, women will keep missing out on these job opportunities because of gender segregation that shapes their choices from an early age. These are some of the findings from a forthcoming report prepared by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) at the request of the Estonian Presidency of the Council of the EU. \u201cWe cannot ignore gender segregation anymore. This is an EU-wide problem, which reinforces the undervaluation of women\u2019s work and leads to their higher poverty and lower economic independence. The fact that employment growth stems from the creation of quality jobs for men but not so much for women needs to be recognised and dealt with by a much wider circle of stakeholders,\u201d said Virginija Langbakk, Director of EIGE. Even with recent employment boosts, women and men are still concentrated in jobs typical for their gender. Women often end up in part-time jobs that pay less and have a lower social status. Fewer economic opportunities for women not only mean a lower standard of living for themselves, but also rule out the chances of better living conditions for their entire family. \u201cGender stereotypes are the motion force behind segregation, influencing subject choices and career aspirations for girls and boys from a young age. The current situation needs to change. It is up to everyone - parents, peers, teachers and politicians to let young people know that they have both the ability and the possibility to study and work in any field they want, irrespective of their gender\u201d, said Jevgeni Ossinovski, Estonian Minister of Health and Labour. In the coming years, our ageing society will put more and more pressure on the care sector. There are big gender imbalances and a serious undersupply of men who are willing and able to work in this field. Most men are not interested in taking up jobs in women dominated professions. They make up only one fifth of graduates in health and welfare across the EU. Narrowing the gender gap in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education is one way to create fairer economic growth. EIGE\u2019s research shows that this would lead to more jobs (up to 1.2 million by 2050) and increased GDP over the long-term (up to 820 billion EUR by 2050). It would also improve the long\u2011term competitiveness of the EU economy, due to more exports and less imports that would contribute to an improved balance of trade. EIGE\u2019s report \u2018Study and work in the EU: set apart by gender\u2019\u00a0forms the basis of conclusions adopted by the European Council for Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO). It explores progress in overcoming educational and occupational gender segregation in the EU and looks at ways to address it. The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) is the EU knowledge centre on gender equality. EIGE supports policymakers and all relevant institutions in their efforts to make equality between women and men a reality. It provides specific expertise and comparable and reliable data on gender equality in Europe.

On the eve of this occasion Vilnius Town Hall and EU House, where the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) is located, will be lit up in orange. This is how EIGE will place its host city on the map of the global awareness initiative \u201cOrange the World\u201d and calls for action to stop violence against women. Presidential Palace and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also join the campaign and light their buildings in orange. \u00a0\u201cViolence against women is both a cause and a consequence of persisting gender inequalities in all aspects of life. Women\u2019s lower status in society can place them at risk of violence and the experience of violence can undermine their ability to access education, obtain or keep a job. This is a problem also in Lithuania\u201d, said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s director. As part of the Gender Equality Index 2017, EIGE developed a way to measure the extent of violence against women in the European Union. The research made by EIGE measures the prevalence but also the severity and disclosure of violence against women. The research reveals that one in three women in Lithuania have experienced violence since the age of 15 and in most of the cases by more than one perpetrator. Evidence shows that violence is widespread not only in intimate relationship, but also in public spaces such as schools or workplaces. In more than half of the cases, violence caused long lasting physical and psychological harm to the victim. The majority of women who disclosed their experience of violence, claimed to have told about the incident to the police or someone close to them. However, violence still takes very serious forms in Lithuania. The number of femicide by intimate partner is the highest among all the 13 EU Member States, which collect this data. \u00a0\u201cThese figures show how important it is to address the reported violence immediately. It is essential to build mechanisms to help women in need and gain their trust. The violence unfortunately tends to continue and an assault that might seem of lesser importance can lead to severe consequences\u201d, Langbakk stressed. In Lithuania, attitudes towards violence against women is also a concern. Eurobarometer survey in 2016 revealed that almost half of Lithuanians consider that the victim often provokes violence. This number is almost three times higher than the EU average. In addition, 42 % of Lithuanians said they think women often make up or exaggerate claims of abuse or rape. This number is twice as big as the EU average. The violence we know about is only a fraction of reality. In the EU as a whole, almost one in two victims do not disclose violence to anyone. Recent allegations of sexual harassment in Hollywood and European Parliament encouraged women to come forward with their own stories. \u00a0The testimonies highlighted how common it is for women to experience harassment and stay silent about the incident. Most often, the perpetrators are men in a position of power. \u00a0\u00a0 Combating violence against women is a priority to the European Commission. Commission launched a campaign of focused actions to further its commitment to eradicating all forms of violence against women a year ago. In support of Commission\u2019s efforts, EIGE has prepared factsheets on gender-based violence in all the 28 member states. You can find the factsheet for Lithuania here. Vilnius Town Hall and the EU House will be lit up in orange from Friday, 24 November, 17:00 to Sunday, 26 November. The Presidential Palace will also be lit up in orange on 25 November and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania be lit up until 10 December. Gender Equality Index is a unique tool that measures the complex concept of gender equality and assists in monitoring progress of gender equality across the EU over time. EIGE released third edition of the Index on 11 October. Explore here. The measurement structure for the domain of violence measures three aspects: prevalence, severity and disclosure of violence against women. On a scale of 1 to 100, 1 represents a situation where violence is non-existent and 100 represents a situation where violence against women is extremely common, highly severe and not disclosed. The score for Lithuania is 25 compared to 27.5 for the EU as a whole. Scores of the satellite domain of Violence are not included in the final Index score due to the lack of comparable data.

Almost one in two women (47%) who have experienced violence have never told anyone, whether that be the police, health services, a friend, neighbour or colleague. Disclosed violence is only a fraction of the reality. \u201cViolence against women is both a cause and a consequence of gender inequality. In societies that tolerate violence, fail to punish perpetrators and blame victims, women are less likely to speak about it. To end this culture of silence and victim blaming, we need a stronger response from governments, police and justice. Women must know that their claims will be taken seriously and justice will be served so they can get their lives back on track\u201d, said Virginija Langbakk, Director of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). In light of recent allegations in the media, the European Parliament has put forward a resolution on combating sexual harassment and abuse in the parliament and the wider EU. It calls for a zero-tolerance approach towards sexual harassment, encourages victims to speak out and calls on politicians to act as responsible role models in preventing and combating sexual harassment. \u201cSexual harassment is not harmless and comes at a great cost to individuals, their families and the rest of society. To end violence, we urgently need to tackle impunity and social stigma, which lead to underreporting. Men and boys also need to be engaged in violence prevention because gender equality is everyone\u2019s responsibility\u201d, said Vilija Blinkevicute, Chair of the EU Parliament\u2019s Committee on Women\u2019s Rights and Gender Equality. To provide a more nuanced picture of violence against women, EIGE has developed a way to measure the phenomenon, as part of its Gender Equality Index. The new measurement framework sheds light on the spectrum of violence against women that ranges from harassment to death (femicide). It also helps to measure forms of violence, such as human trafficking, intimate partner violence, sexual assault and rape. This tool can help Member States who have ratified the Istanbul Convention, with their monitoring and reporting obligations. For the first time, we have a comparable score for violence against women in the EU and each Member State. The EU\u2019s score is 27.5 out of 100 (the higher the score, the worse the situation), showing that the phenomenon is prevalent, severe and underreported. The national scores range from 22.1 in Poland to 44.2 in Bulgaria. The high score in Bulgaria is mainly because of the rate of non-disclosure of violence, which is more than three times the EU average (48.6 and 14.3 respectively). Many people still regard violence in the home as a personal matter, with 15% of Europeans considering domestic violence to be a private matter, according to the results of the 2016 Eurobarometer survey. However, in recent times things have started to change. More women are coming forward to speak out about violence. The recent allegations of sexual harassment in Hollywood have prompted a worldwide social media campaign #MeToo that aims to break the silence on sexual harassment and violence against women. The measurement structure for the domain of violence measures three aspects: prevalence, severity and disclosure of violence against women. On a scale of 1 to 100, 1 represents a situation where violence is non-existent and 100 represents a situation where violence against women is extremely common, highly severe and not disclosed.

We are moving forward but overall progress is very slow. The EU\u2019s score is just four points higher than ten years ago, now 66.2 out of 100. The top performing country is Sweden with a score of 82.6, while Greece moved to the bottom with 50 points. The award for the most improved country goes to Italy, which made a big leap and gained 12.9 points to place itself at rank 14 on the ladder. \u2018We are moving forward at a snail\u2019s pace. We are still a long way off from reaching a gender-equal society and all countries in the European Union have room to improve. In some areas, the gaps are even bigger than ten years ago. Our Gender Equality Index clearly shows whether government policies are matching the specific needs of women and men and whether they are working or not\u2019 said Virginija Langbakk, Director of European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). \u2018The new results of the Gender Equality Index show that across all areas of life inequality prevails. This means Europe has a duty to act. This year I will propose further measures to help empower women and address the gender pay gap. Equality is not about making women more like men, but about creating an environment where both sexes can have equal choices and fully participate in social, work and family life\u2019, said V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. The biggest gains for gender equality are in decision-making The biggest boost for gender equality over the last ten years has been in the area of decision-making, especially in the private sector. This shows that political and public pressure can work and it did well to bring change on private company boards. Although gender equality in decision-making improved by nearly 10 points over the past decade to reach 48.5, it still has the lowest score. This largely reflects the uneven representation of women and men in politics and marks a democratic deficit in EU governance. This year, the Gender Equality Index presents a new and more comprehensive picture of power. In addition to political and economic decision-making, the results show who rules in the areas of media, research and sports. In the media landscape, there are clearly more women who study journalism (two thirds of graduates) but few make it to the top. The decision-makers in the media are mostly men (women make up 22% of board presidents of public broadcasters in the EU). In the area of research funding, women make up less than a third (27 %) of the heads of research funding organisations. The situation is even worse in the sports sector, where women hold only 14% of top positions in the sports federations across the EU. \u00a0 \u00a0 Progress stalled \u2013 women still do most of the housework Progress has slipped backwards in 12 countries when it comes to the time use of women and men. Only every third man engages daily in cooking and housework, compared to almost every women (79%). Men also have more time for sporting, cultural and leisure activities. Migrant women have an especially high burden when it comes to caring for family members, compared to women born in the EU (46% and 38% respectively). Cutting across gender For the first time, this edition of the Index shows gaps among different groups of women and men. Depending on a person\u2019s age, education, country of birth, disability and family type their life can be completely different to the rest of the population. For example, people with a migrant background are twice at risk of poverty than women and men born in the EU. Young men are missing out on educational opportunities compared to young women and lone mothers have more difficulties to access health and dental services than couples with children. \u00a0 The Gender Equality Index 2017 is out today!

Follow us on Facebook and Twitter for tweets and updates throughout the day, using the hashtag #EIGEIndex The Gender Equality Index is a tool to measure the progress of gender equality in the EU, developed by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). The Index has six core domains - work, money, knowledge, time, power and health \u2013 and two satellite domains: violence against women and intersecting inequalities. It gives more visibility to areas that need improvement and ultimately supports policy makers to design more effective gender equality measures.

It is estimated that 180,000 girls and women are at risk of female genital mutilation in the EU each year. This harmful practice leaves many long-lasting consequences for the victim and in some cases, can be fatal. However, we do not have a full picture of the phenomenon because of underreporting and not enough comparable data. This year, EIGE is continuing to work on the topic and support more Member States better understand and address the problem. \u201cFemale genital mutilation is a severe form of gender-based violence that directly affects girls\u2019 and women's health. It leaves deep psychological and physical scars. EIGE\u00b4s upcoming study aims to identify how many girls are at risk and support Member States to plan effective prevention measures\u201d, said Anke Gittenaer, EIGE\u00b4s seconded national expert from Belgium on gender-based violence. To fill data gaps and help policy makers design better protection measures for girls in the EU, EIGE is working on a study that will estimate the risk of female genital mutilation in six Member States: Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy and Malta. EIGE has previously used this methodology to estimate the risk in Ireland, Portugal and Sweden. The new study will further strengthen the methodology for collecting comparable data on female genital mutilation. It will also propose actions to protect girls at risk. Apart from providing more information on the number of girls at risk, the study will also strengthen Member States\u2019 capacity to prevent female genital mutilation, both in their country and across the EU. The impact of new and evolving patterns of migration will be a focus of the study. As part of the project, EIGE will meet with Member States and experts in the area to exchange knowledge, share good practices and agree on action points. The results of the study will be published in early 2018. Before that, EIGE will release additional information about female genital mutilation in the EU as part of the Gender Equality Index 2017. The Index report on violence will be published in November 2017.

One of the main challenges is that girls and boys tend to choose subjects according to traditional gender roles. This is one of the findings of new research by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). In Lithuania, men dominate study fields such as computing (87.5%) and engineering (83.1%), while women hold the majority of degrees in social services (81.6%) and health care (74.7%). The trend is similar in other EU countries. \u201cThe situation will not change unless teachers and parents encourage girls and boys to choose more atypical fields, like STEM for girls, and education and welfare for boys. The classroom should be an environment that challenges gender stereotypes and breaks them down. Unfortunately, it often works in the opposite direction by reinforcing traditional ideas about what girls and boys can or should do and thus limiting their potential\u201d, said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s director. The gender gaps in higher education carry on to the job market. Out of the 20 largest occupations in the EU, only five show a gender balance (40/60 ratio) between women and men. Recipe for economic growth EIGE\u2019s research shows that narrowing the gender gap in STEM subjects would significantly benefit not just women, but the EU economy as a whole. By 2050, GDP per capita would increase by 3.0% (820 billion euros) and create an additional 1.2 million jobs. In the EU comparison, the Baltic States, as well as other central and Eastern European countries have better gender balance in the STEM sector than the other Member States. Women make up 30% of science and engineering professionals in Lithuania, whereas the range within the EU is from as low as 20% in Luxembourg and as high as 44% in Latvia. However, also here women are missing out on jobs that are generally well paid and secure. \u00a0\u201cGender segregation is a problem for the whole economy. For example, by 2025, Lithuania is looking at a 21% employment boost in the area of information and communication technology. It is a field with an increasing demand for talented people, but if STEM continues to be seen as a men\u2019s domain, Lithuania is using only a half of its potential\u201d, said Virginija Langbakk. EIGE\u2019s study encourages policy makers to tackle gender stereotypes early on. One way to achieve this is through gender sensitive teaching materials and training teachers to address these stereotypes. The educational system should promote STEM subjects to girls and women and encourage all students to break down gender expectations when it comes to their career choices.

Is it getting better or worse? Which countries have progressed the most? Where do we need to improve? On 11 October 2017, you will get the full picture from the Gender Equality Index! In this edition, we introduce several new elements that give a more accurate picture of the realities faced by women and men living in the EU. The Index also shows trends in gender equality over the past ten years. One new element is the focus on intersecting inequalities. This Index gives a more nuanced picture of our society, as we look at how gender intersects with other factors such as disability, age, education, country of birth and family type. We have also expanded the domain of power. In addition to political and economic power, we are also looking at who is behind the news headlines, who controls the money in research funding and who decides in the sporting world. For the first time, the Index will look into healthy and less healthy behaviours of women and men. Who has a healthy diet and exercises regularly? How similar are the smoking and drinking habits of women and men? EIGE will present the Gender Equality Index 2017 in Brussels on 11 October.

EIGE looks at the situation for the ageing workforce through a gender lens. The report focuses on the ageing workforce in the EU, which has implications for employment, working conditions, living standards and welfare. Coordinated by EU-OSHA, the report shows how information from four agencies can support policy-making that is both complementary and greater than the sum of its parts. It draws on the agencies\u2019 expertise in each of their areas and covers the different challenges associated with the ageing workforce and considers innovative solutions. EU-OSHA presents policy examples of integrated approaches to occupational safety and health for an ageing workforce. Eurofound examines working conditions for workers of all ages, related work sustainability outcomes and how the right policies can foster longer working lives. Cedefop explores how vocational education and training can be used to support active ageing at work. EIGE provides a gender perspective on the issue of the ageing workforce and discusses the different challenges that men and women face. The report also outlines the impact of long-term demographic trends on employment, and examines lifelong participation in learning. This is followed by a call for active ageing solutions that ensure older workers remain active, skilled and employed.

Despite the lack of data, EU estimates show that one in ten women have experienced some form of cyber violence since the age of 15. \u201cWomen are more likely than men to be victims of severe forms of cyber violence and the impact on their lives is far more traumatic\u201d, said Jurgita Peciuriene, EIGE's programme coordinator for gender-based violence. Experts warn us not to think of cyber violence as a separate phenomenon to real-world forms of violence. Women and girls who have experienced sexual harassment, stalking or violence from an intimate partner \u2018offline\u2019 are also often victims of \u2018online\u2019 violence from the same person. As with all types of violence, cyber violence affects the lives of victims tremendously and comes in many forms. Cyber stalking, for example, refers to a person repeatedly sending unwanted e-mails or text messages to their victims. Cyber harassment relates to offending a person online with unwanted sexually explicit messages, threats of violence or hate speech. One of the most disturbing forms of online violence is non-consensual pornography, which former partners often commit. This means posting or distributing sexually graphic images or videos online without a person\u00b4s permission. Research suggests that up to 90 % of non-consensual pornography victims are women and the number of cases is rising. More information and awareness needed The EU does not yet have a common approach or even a common definition for cyber violence, which means that each country defines and punishes it differently. Some countries do not even consider it a crime. Furthermore, many cases of cyber violence are not reported to the police. In cases where victims do report cyber violence, police and justice may not take it as seriously as real-life incidents of violence. All of this results in data gaps and a lack of comparable statistics at EU-level, which means we cannot show decision makers how frequently it happens. This is a serious concern, as it means that victims often have to make do with inadequate or sometimes even zero protection. To shed more light on this rapidly growing challenge, EIGE has published a paper focusing on the need for gender-disaggregated data on cyber violence. It finds that although cyber violence affects women and girls in different ways to men and boys, studies tend not to differentiate between women and men victims or perpetrators. A few Member States such as Germany, France and the UK have adopted interventions and good practices to address this issue, however more research and action is needed to tackle cyber violence and the threat it poses. The recommendations outlined in EIGE\u2019s paper highlight the need for better policy responses, more prevention measures and awareness raising. For example, educating women and girls, as well as gender sensitive training on cyber violence for the police.

More reliable and comparable data are urgently needed to ensure that policy responses to violence are as effective as possible. EIGE\u2019s new project on improving administrative data takes the Institute\u2019s previous work on the topic one step further. It aims to improve the availability, quality and comparability of data collected by police and justice services on intimate partner violence and rape. Administrative data shed light on cases of violence that might otherwise go undetected. \u201cIf a woman goes to the police to report that she has been raped, the crime should be registered. Then if the matter goes to court, the justice system should also record the case and the outcome. These types of records are what we call administrative data. They provide a better understanding of the demand for services by victims, the response by police and justice and the effectiveness of prevention and protection measures\u201d, explained Barbora Holubova, gender-based violence researcher at EIGE. All EU countries collect administrative data but to varying extents and in different ways. For this reason, important information is often missing, such as the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator, which is crucial to identify cases of intimate partner violence. In addition, definitions of violence are different in each country, making it difficult to compare data across the EU. For example, only five Member States refer to intimate partner violence when describing violence between partners. In 10 Member States, the word \u2018domestic violence\u2019 is used and the term \u2018family violence or \u2018violence in the family\u2019 is used in another 12 Member States. Furthermore, this information is often collected in different ways. For example, some administrative data sources count only solved cases (Sweden), while others count each incident (Germany). More reporting of violence would lead to increased reliability of information. \u201cMany women do not come forward to report violence because there is still a lot of stigma and social acceptance around it. Sometimes victims are blamed for the violence and some might not yet have established trust in the police and justice\u201d said Barbora Holubova. Currently, EIGE is organising meetings with all Member States and national authorities responsible for data collection on violence against women. After discussing gaps and challenges, EIGE will propose country-specific recommendations that take into account the legal context of each country. The recommendations aim to improve and harmonise data collection methods and assist countries with their regular reporting duties, for example to Eurostat, and for reporting requirements under the Victims\u2019 Rights Directive and the Istanbul Convention. Ultimately, they will support EU efforts to eradicate violence against women.

This poses a major challenge for the 64 million women and men with low levels of education in Member States. They are more often unemployed or completely out of the labour market, compared to people with middle and high levels of education. Women with low qualifications find it especially hard to access jobs with decent pay. Only 42 % of low qualified women are employed and almost half of these work in a precarious job. These are some of the findings from a new study on gender, skills and precarious work from the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) out today. \u201cEuropean labour market forecasts show the biggest future demand is for high-skilled jobs in the male-dominated areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). These job opportunities are not available for people with low levels of education and women in particular, are missing out. That is why equal access to affordable and good quality training is so important to provide new skills needed for the jobs of the future,\u201d said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s director. Over 6 million women and 2 million men without upper secondary education across the EU have never been employed. 14 % of women and 5 % of men with low qualifications have been out of the labour market for 10 years or more. As a result of the financial crisis, long-term and youth unemployment, pose serious challenges for the EU in achieving the EU2020 employment targets. \u201cLow qualifications put people at a higher risk of precarious employment, which means very low pay, few working hours and insufficient job security. Almost half of women with low qualifications (45%) work in a precarious job compared to just over a quarter of men with the same level of education (26%). EIGE found that women in general are more likely to work in these types of jobs than men, regardless of their level of education. More than a quarter of women employees in the EU have precarious work,\u201d said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s director. The recently communicated European Pillar of Social Rights aims to improve the working and living conditions of citizens. It stresses the need for equal access to quality and inclusive education, training and life-long learning. Upskilling can unlock untapped potential in the EU, especially when it comes to women\u2019s participation in the workforce. Opportunities for upscaling skills must go together with fair working conditions that improve the quality of work for all.

The data will complement other areas of gender statistics already covered by EIGE\u2019s Gender Statistics Database, such as employment, education and health. The number of women holding decision-making positions has been gradually increasing over the last ten years, from politics to business and media. The latest figures on women and men in decision-making show that the EU is taking a slow but steady path towards gender balanced representation. In national parliaments, women account for less than a third of the members. This figure varies considerably across Member States, from 46.1% in Sweden to 9.5% in Hungary. A look behind the numbers shows that gender imbalance is further reflected in the division of ministers\u2019 portfolios. Women politicians are often appointed to more nurturing and feminine portfolios such as education, health and culture, reinforcing traditional stereotypes about women\u2019s roles and expertise. Their male counterparts tend to be designated to more hardline and masculine areas such as defence, security and technology. Whilst \u201cgender parity\u201d implies equal representation of women and men in a decision-making position, the term \u201cgender balance\u201d is used to describe at least 40% of each gender. In the private sector, the progress towards gender parity is mixed, with some areas advancing faster than others. There has been an upward trend in the number of women in boardrooms since 2010, when the matter became a priority on the European\u2019s Commission political agenda. The proportion of women on the boards of the largest listed companies in the EU doubled from 11.9% in 2010 to 23.9% in 2016. Nevertheless, at the most senior levels of top management, men are still making the majority of the decisions. Only 5.7% of CEO positions are held by women. Gender imbalance is also common across the EU media landscape. Although nearly two thirds of graduates from journalism courses are women, few tend to advance to senior posts compared to men. Only a third of decision-making positions in this field across the EU are held by women. A positive trend has been noted among public broadcasting organisations, where the percentage of women holding board seats went up from 30.4% in 2014 to 35% in 2016. \u00a0 \u00a0 Data on decision-making are collected for the 28 EU Member States and seven other European countries [1]. Data on national and European politics are updated quarterly and data on key decision-making positions in large listed companies are collected every six months. Other data is updated annually.

These are the main results of a new study by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE), launched on the occasion of international women\u2019s day on 8 March 2017. \u201cEquality between women and men is one of the EU's fundamental values. It is about fairness. Now numbers talk: equality is a driver for economic growth. Gender equality will bring more growth to Europe\u201d, said Vera Jourov\u00e1, Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. \u201cOur study proves that gender equality is good for the economy and it cannot be disregarded if the EU wants to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. For far too long, gender inequalities have been limiting women\u2019s economic opportunities and we now have proof that gender equality is crucial for the entire economy\u201d, said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s director. The evidence confirms that improvements to gender equality would generate up to 10.5 million additional jobs by 2050 and the EU employment rate would reach almost 80%. EU Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita would also be positively affected and could increase up to nearly 10% by 2050. The level of economic benefits varies considerably across Member States, with some individual countries seeing around a 4% GDP increase and others exceeding 10%. Countries with more room to improve their current level of gender equality have much to gain. Improved gender equality measures could also help address demographic challenges for the EU, such as the ageing population. Previous research suggests that gender equality is linked to higher fertility rates, which would lead to a larger population and an increase in long-term labour supply. This is important in light of current EU demographic projections, which predict a rise in the number of older people out of the labour force. The study on the \u2018economic benefits of gender equality\u2019 looked at what the economic impacts would be if gender inequalities were reduced in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education, labour market activity and pay. It also considered the demographic changes when these gender gaps are reduced. No previous study has attempted econometric modelling of such a broad range of macroeconomic benefits of gender equality in the EU. \u00a0 Read the full report here Learn more on our website here For more information, please contact: Helena Morais Maceira, helena.moraismaceira@eige.europa.eu Dimitrios Tsoutsias, dimitrios.tsoutsias@eige.europa.eu", "url": "https://eige.europa.eu/news/gender-equality-boosts-economic-growth"}, {"id": "EIGE_NEWS_0081", "date": "2017-02-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIGE office closed on 22-23 February", "text": "We kindly inform you that we are having an internal workshop and the office will be closed for two days (22-23 February).

With three new studies already underway, EIGE is delving into the classroom to unearth some of the gender related challenges in education. \u201cEducation and gender equality are very closely connected, with the classroom providing an ideal place to break-down gender stereotypes early on. However, educational settings can also reinforce them. For example, through textbooks which show women working in traditional roles, such as nurses and teachers and men working as engineers and scientists,\u201d said Jolanta Reingarde, senior researcher at EIGE. A better understanding of these challenges, including higher dropout rates for boys and gender segregation in study fields is needed to promote gender equality in European societies \u2013 through the education systems themselves. \u00a0 What are gender stereotypes? They are predetermined ideas that attribute specific characteristics, roles and behaviours to women and men according to their gender. Gender stereotypes can limit the development of natural talents of girls and boys, women and men, as well as their educational and professional experiences. For the complete definition see EIGE\u2019s Glossary and Thesaurus. \u00a0 Roles start forming at school Gender inequality in education is one of the top three challenges for gender equality in the EU (together with imbalances in decision-making roles and uneven distribution of time, e.g. hours spent on domestic tasks), according to EIGE\u2019s Gender Equality Index. On average in the EU, there are twice as many women as men studying education, health and welfare, humanities and arts. Gender stereotypes are a big challenge that can influence the subject choices girls and boys make when they are young, which can determine their future career aspirations. As a result of different educational choices between girls and boys, there is also a division in the type of work they choose. More boys end up in engineering and IT jobs, while girls dominate teaching and caring professions. These job choices will also affect their future prospects, and many women will be worse off financially as the type of jobs they go into are usually valued less and paid less, e.g. child-care workers. EIGE\u2019s study on gender related challenges in education will map the situation in each EU Member State. It will give a full picture of the overall challenges facing EU education systems and provide recommendations on the best ways to address them. \u00a0 From study to working life To find out more about the gender split in subject and career choices, EIGE will be looking into gender segregation in tertiary education, training and the labour market. This new study will examine the trends and reasons for women\u2019s and men\u2019s subject choices in education and training. It will then look at the pathways into jobs for women and men who study in fields that are uncommon for their gender, e.g. men who study nursing. The study will also analyse the pay gap between occupations characterised as \u2018masculine\u2019 and which pay more, such as engineering, compared to \u2018feminine\u2019 jobs which pay less, for example teaching. \u00a0 Education as a way to improve life This spring, EIGE will publish a research note on gender, skills and precarious jobs in the EU. It will look at how improving the skills of women and men could help their situation in the job market. Special focus will be on people who work less than 10 hours a week, earn a low salary or have a contract for less than a year \u2013 otherwise known as precarious jobs. The study will also consider the different challenges women and men face \u2013 and the opportunities they have to adapt their skills. Women and men also tend to be segregated in precarious work, with women working as domestic, hotel, office cleaners or helpers and men working in transport, storage and agriculture. \u00a0 The three studies in a nutshell 1. Gender related challenges in education: To find out the main challenges, EIGE is consulting with experts and policy makers in all EU Member States. The aim is to provide policy and decision makers with guidelines and recommendations on how to strengthen the value of gender equality in and through education systems. The results will be published in October 2017. A further study on the integration of migrants in education is planned for 2018.

For the brief time she was among us here at EIGE she touched our hearts and her friendship will be sadly missed. Christine dedicated her academic and professional life to the advancement of women\u2019s rights and gender equality. She obtained her PhD in women\u2019s rights and politics from Queen\u2019s University, Belfast (2003), building on an LLM degree in human rights law from the University of Nottingham and a Master\u2019s degree in political science and law from the Strasburg-based Robert Schumann University. Prior to joining the European Institute for Gender Equality in 2015, she served as Director of the END FGM Campaign with Amnesty International from 2009 to 2014 and was an advisor and expert for the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency and the European Institute for Gender Equality on FGM in Europe and gender based violence. She was awarded Amnesty International\u2019s Gender Defender Award in December 2014 and its END FGM European campaign was recognised as a promising practice by UN Women. The issue of FGM has since been mainstreamed in legislation, policy frameworks and practices of EU Member States. Between 2004 and 2008 she was Policy Director of the European Region of International Lesbian, Gay, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA-Europe) supporting the cause of human rights of LGBT people in the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union and the United Nations. She also held research positions with the Northern Irish Human Rights Commission from 2001 to 2004. Her sense of fairness, human solidarity and commitment to end all forms of gender-based violence and inequalities, were reflected throughout her life as she incessantly sought to enable disempowered victims to become actors with strong voices.

Young people, lone parents, migrants, people with disabilities and families with three or more children are most at risk of poverty. Today, almost 23 million children in the EU grow up in poverty. There is also clear evidence that a heavy dependence on a father\u2019s income in many families increases the risk of poverty and insecurity. Especially when unexpected life events occur, such as job loss, family break-up, serious illness or even death. The study shows that if a father were to lose his job, 70\u00a0% of couples with children would fall into poverty. \u201cWe need to ensure better career options for women, fair wages and better social systems, such as pension schemes that consider the different needs and challenges women and men face. These will help protect not only women against poverty, but also the whole family, including men and children\u201d, said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s Director. Employment is crucial in safeguarding people against poverty, however a job is not always enough. A third (36\u00a0%) of men and a quarter (25\u00a0%) of women who are poor are employed. Many working men live in poor households because their wives or partners are out of the labour market or earn very low income. Women with children have a relatively low employment rate. Only half (55\u00a0%) of women with three or more children have a job. With the arrival of each additional child, the economic independence of women shrinks. The need to care for children, parents or sick and disabled relatives keeps many women out of paid work and this has life-long consequences for their career, financial situation and ultimately on pensions. \u2018In an inclusive society, people\u2019s well-being and life chances should not be pre-determined by their gender or other social factors. Nor should children create a poverty risk\u2019 said Virginija Langbakk. Read the full report Read the fact sheet on poverty, gender and lone parents Who is at risk in the EU? Some people face a higher risk of poverty than others. Factors like gender, age, ethnicity, migrant background, disability or type of household can affect a person\u2019s vulnerability to poverty and social exclusion. Lone parents: Almost half of all lone parents are poor and women are particularly affected as they make up 85\u00a0% of all one-parent families in the EU. Disability: Just under a third of women (31\u00a0%) and men (29\u00a0%) with disabilities are at risk of poverty and social exclusion in the EU (2014). Women and men with disabilities face different barriers in life. More women experience obstacles to mobility, accessing transport and buildings. Age: Young people are most affected by poverty and social exclusion in Europe, especially when they are no longer living with their parents. While young women and men face a very similar risk of poverty, older women (+75 years) are at much higher risk than older men. Women are clearly paying the price of gender inequalities at an older age. Migrant background: Migrants face a higher risk of pov\u00aderty than the native-born population. 41 % of women and 39 % of men born in a non-EU country were at risk of pov\u00aderty or social exclusion in 2014. There is a very large gender gap in the inactivity of women and men born outside the EU (39 % of women and 20 % of men were inactive in 2014). Roma: Nine out of ten Roma women and men are poor and the situation is especially hard for Roma women. In 2011, nearly 35\u00a0% of Roma men were in employment compared to nearly 21\u00a0% of Roma women. The report \u2018Poverty, gender and intersecting inequalities in the EU\u2019 was prepared at the request of the Slovak Presidency of the Council of the EU (2016).

The Orange event marks the start of the EU Commission\u2019s yearlong campaign of focused actions to combat violence against women. Making gender equality a reality is the key to eradication of violence against women. Making gender equality a reality is key to addressing the root causes of violence against women, which harms not only individuals but also families, communities and societies as a whole. In support of the campaign and to give an overview of violence against women in different national contexts, EIGE is launching a series of fact sheets covering all Member States and the EU as a whole.\u00a0 It is estimated that one in three women on average in the EU has experienced physical or sexual violence, or both, since she was 15 years old. However, this figure may only reflect a fraction of the reality. It is not easy to have an accurate picture of the extent of violence because many women do not report their cases due to a social acceptance of violence, and in some Member States a low level of trust in Police. \u201cCurrently there is no common way to measure violence against women in the EU, making it difficult to compare results and see what preventative measures are actually working or not. EIGE is working hard to develop such a framework for all Member States that will give solid data to help monitor the situation and help all actors plan effective actions to decrease and finally, eradicate this horrible phenomenon\u201d, said Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s Director. EIGE will be regularly communicating facts and information about the efforts to eliminate violence against women.

With all the aspects to consider, where is the place to start? EIGE\u2019s new online tools will help with practical and detailed information in three areas: gender impact assessment, institutional transformation and gender equality training.\u00a0 These tools are part of EIGE\u2019s Gender Mainstreaming Platform, an online guide to identifying and addressing gender equality challenges across different areas of society. Gender Impact Assessment Policies often impact women and men differently, sometimes even reinforcing social, cultural or economic gender inequalities. The aim of the gender impact assessment tool is to help to identify where policies are causing or strengthening gender inequalities and how they can be effectively re-directed. \u00a0This means that gender equality objectives can be defined from the very beginning of any policy design. The tool not only provides a theoretical model of gender impact assessment but also includes real, hands-on information from several Member States on its practical use. Institutional transformation To achieve real, long lasting results, institutions must do more than implement a few \u2018ad hoc\u2019 changes. A gender mainstreaming strategy requires institutions to transform, starting from their basic values and beliefs, to the rules and regulations that lead to more effective working outcomes. For example, there should be a clear commitment made by the top management to address gender inequalities within the organisation, and incentive mechanisms should be in place to encourage and motivate staff to integrate a gender perspective as a central aspect of their working environment. Gender Equality Training It is vital that employees understand the importance of recognising and addressing gender inequalities. Through providing gender equality training and equipping employees with knowledge of effective methodologies and tools they will be able to effectively contribute to gender equality. If gender equality training is implemented systematically, it facilitates a positive change in attitudes and improves employees\u2019 ability to take account of the gender perspective in their own work.

The two institutions provide universities and research organisations with practical steps to make institutional change in the research sector, which is still dominated by men. The tool was presented to top political decision-makers and leaders of academia in Brussels. EU Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation, Carlos Moedas said: \u201cIn Europe, we have come a long way in promoting gender equality in science. But while women now account for about half of the PhD graduates, they are still underrepresented among researchers, full professors and heads of institutions. Therefore I call on research organisations and universities to further promote equal opportunities amongst their staff with the help of gender equality plans and the sharing of best practices.\" The GEAR tool gathers the good practices of universities and research organisations and bases itself on the findings of EU funded projects in the field of Gender Equality Plans and institutional change. In the global market for ideas, attracting talent is a key for innovation and success. In addition to companies, universities and other research performing organisations have to compete for the best. Making sure that no one is left behind because of their gender or discriminated against on other grounds is also essential.\u00a0 EIGE\u2019s Director Virginija Langbakk explained: \u201cEuropean research cannot afford not using its full potential. We must make the best use of every person\u2019s knowledge and transform existing barriers into opportunities. The GEAR tool helps universities and research organisations create an environment that empowers and inspires both women and men. Improving our talent pool will also contribute to a more competitive Europe.\u201d According to the She Figures 2015, women in the European Union represent more than half of graduate students in 2012, but account for only 33 % of all researchers. The gender gaps are even larger among top academics and heads of higher education institutions. Gatekeeping and vertical gender segregation is still a persistent reality in the research sector.

While most gender inequalities disadvantage women, there are also important issues to address that primarily affect men, ranging from higher suicide rates to lower levels of achievement in education and lower engagement in caring for children and other household duties. \u201cEverything we do has a gender perspective:\u00a0 we look at the different challenges, experiences and opportunities for women and men to access resources and use their potential\u201d, explains Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s Director. \u201cThis does not mean that the focus on the situation of women can be lessened, but it\u2019s about having a more effective approach to the different challenges facing both genders\u201d. In many areas, women and men face very different challenges. For example, in the area of education women have already reached the educational targets set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy, which aim to decrease the school drop-out rates to below 10% and raise the number of 30-34 year-olds completing third level education to at least 40%. However, men are still lagging behind. Statistics show that in the EU-28 on average, there are significantly less men than women aged 30-34 with a tertiary degree (34% vs 43%) and more men are leaving school early (12% of men vs 10% of women). Unless the reasons behind these gaps are understood and addressed, Europe will struggle to reach its 2020 educational targets. Another key challenge to overcome is men\u2019s involvement in household and caring activities. While women are currently more likely to perform the majority of these tasks, distributing care and housework responsibilities more equally is beneficial for everyone. For example, ensuring that men are meaningfully involved in their children\u2019s lives from very early on not only enables them to establish good relationships with their children, but it also has a broader positive impact, such as allowing both women and men to benefit from a better work-life balance. From a wider perspective, it is not only fair, but also important that men are engaged in gender equality. \u201cWe need to involve more men in the creation of a more equal society by raising awareness about their role and demonstrating how gender equality can benefit their lives too,\u201d explains Ms. Langbakk. One important area where men can play a positive role is the struggle against the ultimate form of gender inequality \u2013 violence against women. To inspire more men to get involved and be part of the solution, EIGE is encouraging men to join the White Ribbon Campaign - one of the world\u2019s largest male-led campaigns to end violence against women. White Ribbon Ambassadors are men who promise to never commit, excuse, or remain silent about violence against women. EIGE has already identified a number of high profile Ambassadors, from the President of the European Parliament to\u00a0 the Prime Ministers of Malta and Luxembourg. They have demonstrated their political commitment to raise awareness and act as role models, with the potential to change attitudes and create a culture in which violence against women has no place.

However, most are quite general, which can create doubt and cause difficulties in understanding the text.\u00a0 Furthermore, the lack of clarity in some provisions leaves interpretation open to Member States. This means that support and protection for victims may not always be implemented in the best possible way. The Victims\u2019 Rights Directive was launched by the EU Commission in 2011, with the aim to ensure that every victim of crime in Europe can receive the same level of rights, protection, support and access to justice, regardless of their nationality and place where the crime occurred. The Directive also sets out practical measures to ensure victims\u2019 rights are upheld across the EU. EIGE\u2019s analysis of the Directive determines which provisions benefit victims of gender-based violence, as well as those that can be counterproductive, or cause unintended effects. It is targeted at national policy makers, to assist them implement the Directive in a gender-sensitive way, considering the specific needs of victims of gender-based violence. One of the clear strengths of the Directive is the right to access victim support services. Article 8 states that victims shall have access to confidential victim support services, free of charge and which act in the interest of victims before, during and for an appropriate time after the criminal proceedings. Despite these positive measures, drawbacks still exist. For example, this provision does not stress the need for an adequate geographic distribution of support centres or facilities for people with a disability. As a result, this could mean that victims of gender-based violence who have a disability or live in rural areas may have difficulty in accessing support services. From a gender perspective, one of the most concerning issues with the Directive is that it only protects victims of criminal offences as defined by individual Member States. However not all forms of gender-based violence are considered a crime and therefore not all victims will benefit from protection under the Directive. For a more in depth analysis of all 26 articles in the Directive, you can consult EIGE\u2019s report \u2018An analysis of the Victims\u2019 Rights Directive from a gender perspective\u2019.

EIGE\u2019s online Gender Equality Glossary and Thesaurus features over 400 accurate, up-to-date and gender-sensitive definitions. The glossary and thesaurus is a step towards ending confusion around key terms.

The online tool will also contribute to more gender-sensitive language and challenge terms that reinforce gender stereotypes and ignore gender differences. \u201cWe hope that the glossary and thesaurus will come in handy for various experts.\u00a0 For example, librarians can use the terms to \u2018tag\u2019 library resources. EU and national policy makers can use it when mainstreaming gender equality into policies. Civil society organisations can use the terms when advocating for gender equality\u201d, states Monika Bystrzycka, EIGE\u2019s project manager. The tool is currently available in English but will later be translated into all official EU languages, following an agreement on translations. The first translated versions will be in French, German and Spanish. The terms and definitions are also compatible with the ones used by Eurostat and are aligned with Eurovoc \u2013 the EU-wide multi-lingual terminology database.

Whether you work in fisheries, transport or any other area of the society, it should always be there! With EIGE\u2019s new platform, there are no more excuses to ignore gender concerns. We show you how to mainstream gender, tailor-made for your field. \u201cEIGE\u2019s Gender Mainstreaming Platform presents the different challenges for gender equality in 19 policy areas and introduces practical ways to address them\u201d, explains Barbara Limanowska, Senior Gender Mainstreaming Officer at EIGE. \u201cIn the end, this makes policies more responsive to people\u2019s needs and contributes to better outcomes for all, girls and boys, women and men.\u201d Whichever sector you pick, there are plenty of challenges to address.\u00a0 In classrooms you see more boys in science and technology, while more girls are studying humanities. On the sports fields, the coach of any team is more likely to be a man. Buses and trains run on routes planned by men, even though most of the users are women. And the list goes on across all sectors. For example, in the area of fisheries, one of the main challenges is to address women\u2019s invisible contribution. A lot of work is done by spouses, life partners, mothers, sisters and daughters who are not formally engaged in work but still play an active role in family fishing or aquaculture businesses. They are rarely paid and their efforts are not recognised by society. A formal acknowledgement of their contribution as part of the work force, including access to social security benefits, such as pension rights and maternity leave, would be a major improvement to their lives. The platform is intended to guide policy-makers, practitioners and experts, but it is also useful reading for everybody. It makes it easier to understand gender concerns in many different policy areas, from transport to agriculture, energy to culture. You can also check out the situation in your own country. We have country specific information on laws, government bodies, and good practices from each of the 28 EU Member States.\u00a0 The platform provides a range of methods and tools that give step-by-step instructions to address the different needs of women and men - from gender budgeting, to gender monitoring and gender equality training.

Malta scored 46.8 out of 100 on EIGE\u2019s most recent update of the Index (2015), giving it a rank of 16, when compared to the other 28 EU Member States.\u00a0 EIGE\u2019s Gender Equality Index measures equality between women and men in six core domains: work, money, knowledge, time, power and health. It then assigns a score to each Member State - 1 for total inequality and 100 for complete equality. Malta\u2019s primary strength in gender equality lies in the health domain. It gains the top score amongst all Member States in this area (95.6), which reflects a good balance in access to health services and overall health status for both women and men. Significant challenges for Malta lie in the domain of power. Malta scored 28.3 out of 100, which is not the lowest score in Europe, but there is evidently room for improvement. Women are seriously lacking from decision-making positions in the political sphere, and even more so from the economic one. Another serious challenge is in the unequal division of time women and men spend on care, domes\u00adtic tasks and social activities. Out of all the domains, the score in time has decreased the most since 2005 (by 10.6 points). Women spend increasingly more time on care activities and little on leisure, sporting or voluntary activities. This has major consequences on the work\u2013life balance of women. The Index also shows signs of positive development over time. Women\u2019s level of full-time employment has increased and access to fi\u00adnancial resources has improved for both women and men. Malta\u2019s score in the domain of knowledge also increased, mainly due to the increased proportion of university graduates, with almost no gap between women and men. EIGE officials will be in Malta this week to discuss the results of the Gender Equality Index and their monitoring tools. Media representatives are welcome to participate in an open panel debate on Tuesday 14th June at Le M\u00e9ridien St. Julians hotel, Malta from 14.00 to 16.00.

It is also dealing with a rising tide of intolerance and discrimination that has accompanied the increasing numbers of refugees arriving in Europe. All these challenges could detract attention from Europe\u00b4s commitment to gender equality\" states Professor Ruth Rubio Marin from the European University Institute. Professor Rubio Marin gave the keynote speech at this year\u2019s State of the Union conference, with \u201cWomen in Europe and the World\u201d as the central theme. Over three days, gender equality was front and centre of discussions, showing that it is still an unresolved and important matter for Europe. To address the current challenges, Professor Rubio Marin puts forward a new emancipatory framework for Europe, one that brings together gender equality, democracy and social justice. \u201cThis new model for development would challenge gender stereotypes and predefined gender roles. It would also involve the equal representation of women in every site of decision making. It would mean bringing a gender perspective to macro-economic policy and gender budgeting. Work/life balance policies would be seen as good for everyone, not just women\u201d. She has a very clear vision of the changes needed for this to happen. \u201cThis vision for gender equality would require affordable quality childcare, after school care and care for other dependents, including the elderly and the differently abled persons. It would require flexible working arrangements, such as job-sharing, working from home, flexitime and innovative measures to promote equal sharing of work and care\u201d. With this scenario, Europe can aspire to close the current gender gaps. As it stands today, the EU\u2019s average score for gender equality as measured by EIGE\u2019s Gender Equality Index is 52.9 out of 100, proving that Europe still has a long way to go before it achieves full gender equality.

The Eastern Partnership countries - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine \u2013 wanted to check the situation in their countries and carried out a similar study using EIGE\u2019s know-how. The findings show that women are remarkably absent from the power structures in Eastern Partnership countries. On average only 17 out of 136 senior ministerial positions in Eastern Partnership countries were held by women in 2015. Women constituted 16% of the elected Members of Parliament, well below gender balance. In the highest ranking civil servant positions, women accounted for only 17 %. The study \u201cWomen in Power and Decision-Making in the Eastern Partnership Countries\u201d not only allows direct comparisons and benchmarking among Eastern Partnership countries, but also with EU countries. The study provides an overview of the most recent policy and legislative developments in the areas of women\u2019s and men\u2019s access to and participation in power and decision-making. It also presents a selection of good practice examples from the region to promote women\u2019s participation in decision-making, ranging from gender mainstreaming in the Georgian Defence Ministry to temporary support measures for women in Moldovan politics.

While gender equality is high in Finland in European comparison, there is still room for improvement in many sectors of society. According to the 2015 Gender Equality Index published by EIGE, Finland scored 73 out of 100. Finland is the second most equal country among the 28 countries included in the index. The highest score was achieved by Sweden, with 74 points. However, this also still falls far short of its target. Based on the most recent statistics, the development in Finland has been reversed in some areas. Particularly in political and financial decision making, equality between men and women has taken a turn for the worse, which may show in Finland\u2019s ranking in the next edition of the Gender Equality Index to be published in 2017. EIGE\u2019s Gender Equality Index measures equality between women and men and the social achievement of the country in six core domains: work, money, knowledge, time, power and health. Finland gets its lowest score (61/100) from the domain of time: women continue to take more responsibility for domestic and childcare activities than men. In EU countries on average, the situation is worse still (38/100). Finland\u2019s score was negatively affected by the pay gaps between women and men and the impact of traditional gender roles in career choices. In the domain of health, Finland was slightly below the EU on average. The index also includes a satellite domain of violence against women. EIGE\u2019s analysis shows that in countries where gender equality if high, violence against women is considered less acceptable and the trust in the police and justice institutions is higher. Therefore, violence is more likely to be reported. Finland clearly belongs to this group of countries, as according to the survey, women in Finland reported violence by a partner more frequently than in EU countries on average.

Reliable and comparable statistics help us to assess the effectiveness of policy measures and services in place, estimate the resources needed to tackle the issue and track progress over time. EIGE\u2019s work on good practices has now identified examples of proven and effective methods on administrative data collection. Administrative data is provided by individuals who report violence to the police, courts, hospitals and shelters. Although EU Member States collect administrative data on violence against women, major obstacles for the collection of reliable and comparable data remain. There is a lack of agreed definitions on the EU level, such as what constitutes domestic violence or sexual assault. Furthermore, data collected may not record the sex of the victim and perpetrator, nor the relationship between them. This makes it very difficult to identify certain types of violence, such as intimate partner violence, and make comparisons across Members States. To support Member States improve the quality of data on violence against women, EIGE has identified 12 good practices on data collection methodologies from ten EU countries. They are divided into three categories of data collection from the following areas: Police and criminal justice\u00a0 Health and social services\u00a0 Female genital mutilation\u00a0 These good practices were selected by experts working in the field of police and justice, statistics, health and social services, academia and civil society organisations who are in contact with women victims of violence. The good practices can be transferred to different contexts and will assist in the future collection of admin data. They will soon be available on EIGE\u2019s website.

The higher up the career ladder you go, the less women you find,\u2019\u2019 says Virginija Langbakk, EIGE\u2019s director.

On average, women hold only 14 % of important decision-making positions such as board members, general secretaries and vice-presidents, and only 5 % of presidents are women. There are also big differences across EU Member States. The proportion of women in decision-making in national federations ranges from 3 % in Poland to 43 % in Sweden. According to a study commissioned by the National Olympic Committee of Lithuania (LTOK) and carried out by \u201cTNS LT\u201d, Lithuanian news portals and TV broadcasters cover women\u2019s sports much less than they do men\u2019s sports. In Lithuanian sports news items online, men are mentioned 4,5 times more often than women. 97% of the televised games show men\u2019s sports. The research also uncovered that the general public would like to be able to see more women\u2019s sports broadcasts. Even those who are of the opinion that watching men\u2019s sports is more interesting agree that women\u2019s competitions are shown on TV nowhere near often enough.

Compared with the EU Member States Serbia\u2019s overall score places it in 22nd position. With a score of 40.6 points out of 100 Serbia is almost half way towards gender equality. In comparison, the EU average is 52.9.\u00a0 \u2018I am glad that Serbia now has an analytical instrument that allows measuring our achievements and gaps regarding gender equality. This will be immensely useful both on the national level and in the EU accession process,\u2019 states Zorana Mihajlovic, Deputy Prime Minister and President of the Coordination Body for Gender Equality of the Republic of Serbia. \u2018I hope that our example and experience will inspire other EU accession countries so that we can also have good regional benchmarks and exchange of policies that deliver results.\u2019 \u00a0\u2018Congratulations to Serbia for this significant milestone. The Gender Equality Index will be a handy and easy to use tool \u00a0for Serbian policy makers and gender equality supporters, just as it is in the EU \u00a0Member States,\u2019 says Virginija Langbakk, the Director of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). \u2018It clearly shows which areas need increased attention, and which policies and laws are effective. The initiative of Serbia paves the way for a common monitoring tool with other EU accession and neighbourhood countries.\u2019 On gender equality in decision-making, Serbia ranks among the top ten EU Member States.\u00a0 The introduction of quotas for Parliamentary elections has contributed to boosting the political participation of women which is reflected in the Index ranking. The Index also highlights other areas where further efforts are needed. For Serbia, as with most other EU Member States the important challenge is to break the tradition of what are typically considered masculine or feminine professions and to make working conditions more family-friendly. The Gender Equality Index was first launched by EIGE in 2013 to monitor the progress in gender equality across the EU and over time. The Index provides a single summary measure and allows for assessment of the level of gender equality in each of its six core domains \u2013 Work, Money, Knowledge, Time, Power, and Health. While the Index is a sophisticated statistical and analytical tool, it presents complex data in a user-friendly and easy to understand way. It is updated every two years and the third edition is forthcoming in 2017.\u00a0 Report \u201cGender Equality Index for Serbia\u201d EIGE\u2019s Gender Equality Index Download the press release in PDF For more information, please contact: Kristaps Petermanis, Coordinator of Cooperation with EU Accession Countries, EIGE E-mail: Kristaps.Petermanis@eige.europa.eu Phone: +370 68 74 64 25 The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) is an autonomous body of the European Union, established to support and to strengthen the promotion of gender equality and the fight against discrimination based on sex, as well as to raise awareness of gender equality in the EU and the Member States.

How nurseries enable people to participate in employment or education? How street lights, public transport and pedestrian paths enable people to move around safely and independently. How parks and public spaces are important so people can benefit from outdoor activities and enjoy leisure time? We use infrastructure every day, often without even realising. It underpins our lives and is essential for the functioning of a society. It is also an effective measure for judging a country\u2019s or region\u2019s development. But what does all of this have to do with gender equality? Infrastructure is meant to address people\u2019s needs and make life easier. Therefore, the different roles and needs of women and men who use public infrastructure have to be taken into consideration and addressed. In Europe, women are more likely to be employed in part-time roles and perform the bulk of unpaid domestic work. They also spend less time on leisure and sporting activities than men. The unequal division of roles in the labour market and division of time spent on domestic tasks can have an impact on the way in which women and men use or need certain types of infrastructure. For example, women are more likely than men to use public transport and take on caring responsibilities for young children. They would therefore benefit more from buses with a lowering platform and a dedicated space to leave their pram. Bus routes with bus stops placed close to schools, nurseries, workplaces and shops would also benefit women and men who use public transport to access these places on a regular basis. These small adjustments could make life easier for people who use buses and travel with children and lead to increased mobility and decrease social isolation. EIGE\u2019s upcoming report on the benefits of gender mainstreaming in infrastructure is based on survey data from over 5000 women and men from all EU Member States. The report will investigate the experiences of European women and men in relation to infrastructure use and the effects on well-being. It will examine the importance of facilitating an approach to infrastructure that takes into account the different needs of women and men. The study is due to be published in mid-2016.

An in-depth study \u2018Gender Equality in Power and Decision-Making\u2019 by the European\u00a0Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE)\u00a0showed that while women occupy one-third of top\u00a0political roles in the European Union, in finance they are much less well-represented. \u2018The money belongs to all of us,\u2019 says EIGE\u2019s Director Virginija Langbakk. \u2018Why is it that only\u00a0men get to decide how it is spent? It\u2019s like something out of the 19th century!\u2019 The report looks at how men and women are represented in power and decision-making\u00a0positions in the public, economic and social sectors in all 28 EU Member States between\u00a02003 and 2014. While progress has been made in many areas, especially in politics, it has been almost nonexistent\u00a0in finance, the report concludes. Of the 28 central bank governors, only one \u2013 of\u00a0Cyprus \u2013 is a woman; and there are only two women finance ministers \u2013 from Romania and\u00a0Sweden.

It\u2019s time finance caught up.\u2019 EIGE, the Vilnius-based agency responsible for gathering and spreading information on the progress of equality between women and men in the EU, says the key factor is commitment. Awareness-raising and legal or voluntary quotas are among the options available to the Member States to promote more women to top jobs. The report concludes that the lack of women in central banking is a result of social structures: persistent male dominant gender roles and continued gender stereotyping that lead to gender-biased recruitment and promotion procedures. The report also has positive news. While the number of Chief Executives of publicly listed companies is extremely low, women\u2019s overall representation on corporate boards has gradually increased from 9 % in 2003 to 20 % in 2014, in particular among Member States where binding legislation is in effect. In politics gender-stereotyping still plays a role with men dominating political portfolios such as defence, justice and foreign policy while women are concentrated in ministries with socio-cultural functions, such as education, health and culture.

Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 underlines: \u2018Progress towards gender equality in the Member States is real, but important gaps remain. I am committed to tackling the remaining gender gaps in Europe. The gender equality index developed by EIGE is a valuable instrument to measure progress achieved by Member States on the way to gender equality.\u2019 The Gender Equality Index is built around six core domains - work, money, knowledge, time, power and health \u2013 and two satellite domains: violence against women and intersecting inequalities. It is based on EU policy priorities and it assesses the impact of gender equality policies in the European Union and by Member States over time. In the Gender Equality Index 2015, the domain of power shows the greatest progress with scores rising from 31.4 out of 100 in 2005 to 39.7 in 2012. Despite this, men\u2019s over-representation in decision-making positions remains prevalent in all Member States both in politics and the economy. The domain of time reveals the lowest score (37.6 out of 100) across the six core domains of the Index. This highlights the unequal division of unpaid work between women and men in the private sphere, which remains the greatest barrier to gender equality. The satellite domain of violence shows that the context in which violence against women takes place, societal attitudes towards violence and trust in institutions, matter in explaining the levels of violence against women. Results show that data collection in this area needs a concerted effort from the Member States.\u00a0 \u00a0 EIGE, the EU knowledge centre on equality between women and men, has developed this unique tool to measure the progress of gender equality in the European Union and its Member States.

This methodology has been pilot-tested in Ireland, Portugal and Sweden. \u2018Being able to estimate the number of girls at risk of FGM can be very useful for policy makers, not only when planning and implementing asylum or migration policies, but also for measures and activities related to social integration,\u2019 states Virginija Langbakk, Director of EIGE. \u2018We hope that this new methodology will allow a better understanding of the phenomenon of FGM, following the efforts that Portugal has made in order to determine the number of girls at risk of female genital mutilation.

The findings of this research stress the importance of cooperation between governments and communities in preventing the practice of female genital mutilation in Europe and beyond. The study employs a mixed-method approach, comprising both a quantitative and a qualitative component. The quantitative component involved the collection of FGM prevalence data (from FGM-practising countries) and data on the female migrant population in the EU Member States. The qualitative component involved focus group discussions aimed at assessing migrants\u2019 attitudes and behaviours towards FGM and how these may be changing over time and within a migration context.

These are the sad results of the \u201cStudy on estimating the costs of gender-based violence in the EU\u201d released by the European Institute for Gender Equality.\u201dDesigning adequate EU-policies however, urgently requires quantitative and qualitative data to measure the real cost of violence against women. The results call for urgent coordinated actions to help women and men on the way to a society free from violence against women\u201c, claims Virginija Langbakk, Director of EIGE. In recent years the European Institutions strengthened their efforts to combat violence against women (gender-based violence). For policies to be efficient they need evidence in the form of comparable and harmonised data. Further, adequate methods are needed to measure the real cost of violence against women in order to address the consequences of this violence more efficiently. The cost of violence against women faced by public bodies, women, and society as a whole is significantly high. Direct costs incurred by a victim are medical attention, legal services and victim support programmes. Indirect costs relate to the negative effect on the economy and society and economic loss to the victim. \u201cWe are facing a very unhealthy effect on society and economy\u201d, Director Virginija Langbakk tells us: \u201cVictims often suffer long term physical and psychological damage that disables their normal lives and decreases their chances of economic participation.\u201d Estimating these costs is a challenging task. The different approaches taken by the Member States to measure the cost make the comparison very difficult. Moreover, there are very limited data available on the precise economical, physical and emotional impact of violence on women. Worse even, the data that are available are not comparable across the EU. In the UK it is estimated that almost 13% of the costs to society of violence against women is reflected in a loss to the economy and almost 26% is estimated to be the cost of services. Most resources are spent on criminal justice services, then health services and social welfare. Based on the UK model, theoretical estimates are provided for other Member States for comparative purposes. The report \u201cStudy on estimating the costs of gender-based violence in the EU\u201d was prepared by Prof. Sylvia Walby, and Philippa Olive, Senior Research Associate, from Lancaster University. \u201cStudy on estimating the costs of gender-based violence in the EU\u201d Download the press release in pdf format: English, Lithuanian updated 15/12/2014", "url": "https://eige.europa.eu/news/cost-violence-against-women-largely-underestimated"}, {"id": "EIGE_NEWS_0117", "date": "2014-12-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Comparable Data is key to tackling Violence against Women", "text": "Although administrative data on violence against women is collected in all EU Member States, their usefulness for policy-making is limited by insufficient comparability. Police and Justice are best in collecting data concerning violence against women, but the data collected are not always sex-disaggregated and therefore inefficient for use by EU legislative bodies. This is one of the main conclusions of a study by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) \u201eAdministrative data sources on gender-based violence against women in the EU: current status and potential for collection of comparable data\u201d. On 8 December representatives of Police and Justice of the 28 Member States, in the presence of a representative of the Presidency of Italy, the European Commission, and other key personnel working in the area of gender-based violence gather at the Council of the European Union, to discuss how data collected by institutions connected to incidents on gender based violence could be harmonised. \u201cExperienced professionals on the ground are best placed to indicate how data can be collected more efficiently to help governments identify the challenges and plan right measures to ensure a society free from violence against women\u201c, claims Virginija Langbakk, Director of EIGE. The eradication of violence against women is a declared goal of the European Commission and EU Member States. This commitment is affirmed in the European Commission\u2019s Women\u2019s Charter (2010)1, the European Pact for Gender Equality 2011-20202, the European Commission\u2019s Strategy for Equality between Women and Men 2010-15, and the Stockholm Programme 2010-14. In recent years the European Institutions have expressed their wish to strengthen their efforts in eliminating violence against women (gender-based violence). For EU-policies to be efficient, the Institutions need evidence in the form of comparable and harmonised data on prevalence, criminal statistics, and information collected in all sectors related to this area. In 2013 EIGE launched the study \u201cAdministrative data sources on gender-based violence against women in the EU\u201d to find out what type of administrative data are being gathered in the EU-28 and how. Administrative data provide detailed information on how justice, police, health, social services and related institutions deal with prevention, protection and prosecution of incidents. The study analyses 144 administrative data sources with a national scope and 90 related statistical products. The results show that Police and Justice are well advanced in the collection, production and provision of administrative data on violence against women in all the EU Member States. There is also a lack of specific mechanisms for systematic data collection. \u201cA better coordination of the collection of data amongst the Member States and a better use of criminal statistics would further improve the usability of the data for policy making on EU-level\u201d, specifies the Director of EIGE, Virginija Langbakk.

EIGE experts investigated the possibilities during an official visit on 14 and 15 October and concluded that it is relevant and technically feasible to construct such an Index in Serbia: Serbia has the appropriate statistical know-how and expertise to do so. The Gender Equality Index was first launched by EIGE in June 2013 and is a successful tool to measure gender equality in the EU. It provides statistical results in specific areas for the EU overall and for each Member State. In fact it delivers a measure of how far (or close) each Member State (and the EU) is from achieving full gender equality. \u201cIt is a great hope for gender equality that a country preparing for European integration is so dedicated to achieving more gender equality\u201d, confirms Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Murphy, Head of Operations at EIGE and leading the EIGE delegation in Serbia. EIGE hopes that the process is a success that can be an example for the whole region and beyond. Serbia is very dedicated to strengthening its institutional mechanisms towards more gender equality. The visit was meant to train Serbian experts that will be involved in calculating the Serbian gender equality index. It was introduced by official meetings between the EIGE delegation and government officials, representatives of the national statistics body and of civil society. Highlight of the mission was a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Zorana Mihajlovic, who has gender equality in her portfolio. The Deputy Prime Minister confirmed that the competent authorities will support the introduction of a gender equality index as a way of analysing the situation in order to monitor progress.

Ms. Langbakk, who has Swedish and Lithuanian roots, oversaw the establishment of the Institute, a statutory independent Agency of the European Union, which is located in Vilnius, Lithuania. EIGE\u2019s role links to the commitment in the European Treaties to foster gender equality as a fundamental principle. EIGE works closely with the European Institutions and with the Member States to strengthen gender equality by collecting and disseminating cross European comparable data on a range of indicators; developing tools to enable administrations at both EU and national levels to integrate gender equality into all policies; encourage the exchange of research and good practices and to promote the public consciousness of gender equality Drawn from a very wide range of activities and outcomes, a key achievement of the first five years was the publication of the European Gender Equality Index in 2013, which offers a comparative base by which all Member States can evaluate their progress to the achievement of gender parity. The Management Board looks forward to collaborating with the Director and her excellent team over the next five years, during which the Board is confident that EIGE will continue to go from strength to strength, serving as the premier centre for expertise on all aspects on gender equality within the European Union.

Gender-based violence against women is still a hidden crime across the EU. The absence of reliable data and information on the prevalence of violence impedes the progress of combating violence against women. Urgent action is needed by governments to address this deficit\u201d, says Therese Murphy from the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE), organiser of the meeting. The results of the first EU study on mapping the current situation and potential of administrative data sources on GBV, conducted by EIGE, show that measuring gender-based violence is seriously hampered by data gaps. There are no comparable sex-disaggregated data in this area at EU level. EIGE\u2019s study has mapped and assessed administrative data sources in EU-28 in terms of their quality and comparability and identified steps necessary to gather comparable data on GBV across the EU-28. All consulted experts highlighted that comparable and harmonised data and effective and structured coordination between the actors involved in data collection are crucial for measuring and monitoring the initiatives to combat gender-based violence. 25,000 shelters are missing EIGE\u2019s report \u201cViolence against Women. Victim Support\u201d has also revealed that specialised services such as shelters, counselling services or hotlines are unequally distributed in and among EU Member States and that many of them face capacity problems and funding issues. According to EIGE\u2019s report, over 25,000 shelter places are missing in the EU. Call for change EU institutions are committed to making the EU free from violence for all. To achieve it, data collection on gender-based violence in Europe has to be improved. We hope that EIGE\u2019s new study and the new tools developed by EIGE will support making the change. It is a mapping tool to consult and explore the potential use of almost 150 main administrative sources and 100 statistical products containing administrative data on GBV at EU-level.

As the Index points out, the EU is not even halfway towards gender equality in the area of decision-making. We all hope that the results of the elections will support bridging this huge gender gap. And we hope for more women in the Parliament to ensure the change.\u201d says Virginija Langbakk, Director of EIGE. EU in deficit of democratic power The Gender Equality Index proposed by the European Commission and created by EIGE is a unique measurement tool which supports evidence-based policy making and indicates where political priorities should be shifted to accelerate the process of achieving a gender-equal Europe. The lowest score in the EU is in the area of power in decision-making,with an average score of only 38 at the EU level (where 1 stands for no gender equality and 100 for full gender equality). It\u2019s well below halfway towards gender equality. The greatest distance from gender equality is in the representation of women and men on boards of the largest quoted companies, with an EU average score of only 23.3. There is significant inequality in political structures \u2212 only 25 percent of ministers and 23 percent of members of the parliaments are women. Measures such as a quota system could improve gender equality in this area and have a positive effect on all other areas. Challenges for gender equality in Lithuania Lithuania, with a gender equality score of 43.6 is below the EU average (54), on the 18th place. The scores show that there are significant challenges that Lithuania needs to address to achieve a more gender equal society. The most visible gender gaps for Lithuania are differences in earnings and income (LT 26.8) and a low representation of women in economic decision-making (LT 29.0). Other researched areas, like Climate Change, rank Lithuania at number 19 among EU Member States in terms of proportion of women in top position within Environment, Transport and Energy sectors. The Gender Equality Index \u2013 for progress in gender equality The Gender Equality Index gives scores for each Member State and presents an EU average in the areas of: work, money, knowledge, time, power and health to enable the first ever detailed assessment of how close the EU and Member States have come towards gender equality in each of the critical areas. Violence and Intersecting inequalities are the two satellite domains of the Gender Equality Index. \u201cI'm very glad that EIGE has developed a Gender Equality Index,\u201d says Michael Gustafson, Chair of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality of the European Parliament. \u201cIt enables each Member State to evaluate and compare amongst each other the progress they\u2019ve made in various fields of gender equality, as well as where progress is most needed.

The radio plays out-of-tune when it comes to the representation of women at decision-making level. There are only 34 % of women among the top level decision-makers in the 10 radio stations that were included in EIGE\u2019s study. Only 16% of the women working there operate at CEO level and the organisational culture remains largely masculine. The struggle is nevertheless worthwhile: \u2018Increased number of women in the decision-making structures of media organisations would bring social justice, better use of talents and innovative decisions. It would also improve media content\u2019 - says Virginija Langbakk, Director of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). Women journalists have in the past suffered from a lack of credibility and equal access to radio jobs. When in 1938 the first female news reporter was introduced on the Swedish radio \u2018angry radio listeners nearly choked on their morning coffee\u2019.Since then, things have improved and women radio journalists have been catching up with men. In its report Advancing gender equality in decision-making in media organisations EIGE discovers that women nowadays represent on average almost half of the employees of the programming and broadcasting activities, reaching up to 44%. EIGE\u2019s report also reveals that women in the broadcasting sector have considerably outnumbered men when it comes to university-level education (68% of women have a higher degree). In 1995, the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA) identified two core areas where action by state governments and the media industry was needed: women have limited access to decision-making in media organisations and the stereotypical portrayal of women in the media. Developing EU-level policies to improve gender equality in media has until now been hampered by the fact that it is nested at the crossroads of several areas of gender equality policy-making (gender equality promotion, media policy, gender mainstreaming, women in decision-making) and the essential need for media to be granted the right of freedom of expression. Based on EIGE\u2019s report, the Council of the European Union has made conclusions on \u2018Advancing Women\u2019s Roles as Decision-Makers in the Media\u2019. In line with the findings the Council calls on the Member States and the European Commission to take active measures to foster gender equality at all levels, including women\u2019s advancement in decision-making roles in the media industry. The Council also calls for enhancing awareness of gender equality within the media sector and the exchange of good practices between Member States in this area that will support the process of achieving a gender-equal society. In 2012-2013, EIGE also conducted the study \u2018Collection of methods, tools and good practices in the field of Women and the Media\u2019. The study led to the development of a database of methods and tools on EIGE\u2019s website and a list of good practices. It revealed the development and implementation of processes of gender training, awareness-raising on gender equality issues and self-regulation and promotion in many Member States and within the media industry.

Generally, the Member States were called upon to strengthen efforts to mainstream gender equality in all governmental policy areas at all levels. One of the suggested ways to do it is through developing easily applicable gender mainstreaming methods and tools, including gender training, gender impact assessment, gender budgeting, monitoring and evaluation. A clear emphasis is put on the promotion of the use of these tools in practice. Moreover, the Council emphasised the importance of gender equality competence among responsible staff by urging the Member States to strengthen expertise in gender equality and gender mainstreaming among public officials accross different sectors. The Member States agreed that gender training should be provided on a regular basis, it should also take into account the needs of the participants.

EIGE\u2019s new report presents the effectiveness of institutional mechanisms and gender mainstreaming in EU member states in 2005 and 2012. It highlights weaknesses and trends in the work of governmental gender equality bodies, such as the inconsistent implementation of gender mainstreaming strategies and the insufficient application of gender mainstreaming tools and methods. Broad political remit narrowed down to legalistic approach Notwithstanding the positive trends, a shift from the political, social and administrative remit of gender equality towards a legalistic approach and procedural mechanisms addressing discrimination at the individual level is evident. Gender equality is seldom addressed in a proactive way, through policies and institutions aimed at promoting gender equality, research and subsequently the implementation of measures that address gender inequalities, including the disadvantages of certain groups of women or men. It is more often viewed as a human rights violation, requiring reactive, legalistic measures to protect individual citizens against discrimination. Embedded in a human rights framework, gender equality loses power and strength to address structural inequalities and discriminations at the societal level. Number of independent gender equality bodies more than halved The independent bodies for protection against discrimination on the grounds of sex are increasingly replaced by bodies for protection against discrimination on various grounds. The number of independent bodies dedicated exclusively to the promotion of equal treatment between women and men have more than halved in 2012 compared to 2005. As EIGE\u2019s research shows, there are only five Member States where discrimination based on sex is addressed separately. Whereas acknowledging the heterogeneity of women and men in terms of age, class, disability, ethnicity/race and sexual orientation is highly important, the consequences of downplaying gender as a structural dimension and underlying element of all inequalities should not be overlooked. More tasks, less resources and power The Council of the EU has stressed that location at the highest possible level in the government, sufficient resources and the possibility of influencing the development of all government policies are preconditions for an effective functioning of national mechanism for gender equality. In spite of the fact that governmental bodies for gender equality and bodies for the promotion of equal treatment on various grounds exist in all Member States, the bodies responsible for gender equality are often marginalised in national governmental structure, lack resources and support from political leaders. Human resources in gender equality bodies have decreased in more than half of the EU Member States since 2005. The level at which the highest responsibility of governments for the promotion of gender equality is vested in the EU Member States has also diminished. Strengthening national gender equality bodies (institutional mechanisms) is a necessary condition for the effective implementation of all EU policies and making equality between women and men a reality in the EU.

During highly informative presentations and intense discussions, speakers and participants provided insights into recently published and forthcoming studies, shared promising practices from various EU Member States and beyond, and exchanged ideas about how to tackle identified challenges. The presentation of studies like WHO\u2019s report \u201cGlobal and regional estimates of violence against women\u201d (2013) and EIGE\u2019s study on female genital mutilation in the EU (2013), as well as of some tentative results from the survey on gender-based violence against women in the EU conducted by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) met great interest. The conference participants agreed that intersectoral cooperation is of fundamental importance to comprehensively addressing GBV, and that intersectoral coordinating mechanisms can play a crucial role. Yet, a number of challenges were identified, such as inter-institutional competition and the existence of very different procedures specific to each institution. However, experiences from a number of EU Member States show how some obstacles can be tackled. Overall, there is a need to challenge social and cultural patterns that accept GBV, in particular through determined efforts to promote gender equality, to challenge gender stereotypes, and to involve women and girls not only as victims but also as empowered agents of change. It was repeatedly stressed that the cooperation between governmental institutions and civil society organisations is particularly important to tackle GBV and support victims. In several sessions, the numerous health-related consequences of GBV were presented, and the crucial role of the health sector was underlined, amongst others because it is often the first point of contact for women victims of GBV. Moreover, the importance of strong legal and policy documents at national, EU and international level was stressed, and challenges regarding their implementation were discussed. It was also pointed out that measuring the costs of GBV can be very useful to drive forward policy-making to tackle GBV and to support victims; and methodologies and results of several national studies on the costs of violence were presented. However, it was argued that costs should not be considered the only reason for change. Speakers and participants agreed that comparable data is crucial for effectively tackling GBV. However, several presentations and comments from the audience highlighted the lack of such data in Europe and beyond, and pointed to the need for harmonised indicators and definitions. Yet, the wish to capture the complexity of GBV and the very different forms of GBV may conflict with considerations regarding the feasibility and utility. The presentation of the Gender Equality Index developed by EIGE highlighted benefits of having one single indicator to assess GBV. As argued by several speakers, administrative data sources could be very useful for collecting comparable data on GBV, but significant challenges persist, such as the fact that data is often not sex-disaggregated and that legal definitions vary between EU Member States. Some recommended actions in this respect are to introduce standard classifications of crimes, to define a set of core indicators, and to make the collection of sex-disaggregated data obligatory in relevant areas. However, it is important to also conduct dedicated surveys on GBV, and not to exclusively rely on administrative data and the inclusion of GBV-related questions in other surveys. Furthermore, when collecting data on prevalence it is important to keep in mind that GBV is never acceptable or excusable, even in places where the prevalence is lower than elsewhere. As emphasised during the closing plenary, the organisers are very satisfied with the outcomes of the conference that brought together a large number and variety of committed actors. Hopefully the knowledge and experiences that were exchanged as well as the contacts that were made during this conference will support the daily work of all participants and strengthen intersectoral cooperation to eliminate GBV in the EU.", "url": "https://eige.europa.eu/news/reflections-conference-eliminating-violence-against-women-europe-intersectoral-approaches-and-actions"}, {"id": "EIGE_NEWS_0128", "date": "2013-11-25", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Eliminating Violence  against Women in Europe Intersectoral Approaches and Actions - Press release", "text": "Copenhagen, Vienna and Vilnius, 25 November 2013 A quarter of all women in the WHO European Region experience physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner. Today, on the first day of the 16-day global campaign of Activism Against Gender Violence, the City of Vienna, with the European Institute for Gender Equality and the WHO Regional Office for Europe, will raise the anti-violence flag to draw attention in Europe to this hidden epidemic. During their lives, 25.4% of women in the European Region experience physical and/or sexual violence by intimate partners, and 5.2% experience sexual violence from people who are not their partners, according to the WHO report Global and regional estimates of violence against women. \u201cViolence against women can not be tolerated in any society,\u201d says Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO Regional Director for Europe. \u201cEradicating violence requires determined efforts to promote gender equality, challenge gender stereotypes and work with women and girls \u2013 not only as victims of violence but as empowered agents of change. We must bridge sectors and engage all parts of society for concerted action, aligned with the new European policy framework for health and well-being \u2013 Health 2020.\u201d \u201cProtection against violence involves restoring to women the dignity that violence has taken from them. We must not stop drawing attention to violence committed against women and focusing on it politically. Awareness raising is hard work, but it brings us closer to our goals,\u201d says Barbara Prammer, President of the Austrian National Council. \u201cAustria has established anti-violence legislation, trailblazing also in the European context. Austria is also among the first countries to have unconditionally ratified the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. In its chairmanship role in the Council of Europe as of November 2013, Austria will give particular emphasis to the issue of protection against violence.\u201d Experts meeting in Vienna on 25\u201326 November 2013 call on countries to adopt the new WHO clinical and policy guidelines on and improve the recording of violence against women. \u201cWe must bring to light this hidden crime and the many different forms that gender violence takes throughout the European Union, from physical and psychological abuse in partnerships, to sexual assault and rape, forced prostitution, trafficking in human beings and female genital mutilation,\u201d says Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Murphy, Head of Operations at the European Institute for Gender Equality in Vilnius, Lithuania. \u201cGender-based violence, which reflects the unequal distribution of power between women and men in our society, is inflicted by men on women and girls. It reinforces inequalities between men and women and compromises the health, dignity, security and autonomy of its victims.\u201d New WHO guidelines for health care professionals Health services play a central role in combating violence against women, since they are very often the first point of contact for victims. The new WHO clinical and policy guidelines provide effective health-sector responses to violence against women. They contain recommendations on first-line support, identification of and clinical care for intimate partner violence and sexual assault, training of health care providers, policy and programmatic approaches to delivery of services, and mandatory reporting of intimate partner violence. \u201cEradicating violence against women requires determined joint efforts and ranks high on Vienna\u2019s political agenda. Social, health and women\u2019s policy in the city has been at the forefront of intersectoral efforts to make sure women affected by violence get effective support and that preventive action is put into place. This is secured by a particularly well developed network of protective and counselling facilities, as well as a wide range of health and social services, including specialized support for particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged groups,\u201d say Vienna city councillors Sandra Frauenberger and Sonja Wehsely. At the core of the city\u2019s protective network are Vienna\u2019s shelter houses, whose 175 places for women and children afflicted by violence exceed the Council of Europe target number of 1 place per 10000 inhabitants. Particular emphasis is put on training health care professionals and victim protection groups to ensure that those affected by violence are identified, treated appropriately and receive ongoing care. Urgent need for reliable comparative data Developing policies on combating gender-based violence is a priority in the European Union (EU) and beyond, which must be supported by solid administrative and statistical data on victims and perpetrators, disaggregated by sex, age and victim\u2013perpetrator relationship. This commitment is affirmed in the European Commission\u2019s Women\u2019s Charter (2010) and Strategy for Equality between Women and Men 2010\u22122015, the Stockholm Programme (2010\u22122014), the Istanbul Convention (Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence) and the Health 2020 strategy. However, gender-based violence still remains widespread and underreported. Some data exist but are insufficient to offer an accurate picture of the prevalence of gender-based violence in Europe. Since 2010, the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) has contributed to important work in the area of gender-based violence in Europe. In the period 2010\u20132013, EIGE initiated several studies on this topic. During the conference in Vienna, EIGE will share the results of some of these studies: on female genital mutilation, the Gender Equality Index and administrative data sources on gender-based violence. The EU\u2019s so-called \u201cvictims\u2019 package\u201d and Directive 2012/29/EU establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime will further contribute to the discussion. The 2012 conclusions of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) called for intensified efforts to develop common definitions and indicators for all forms of gender-based violence in Europe, ensuring their consistent use at both the EU and Member State levels. The new EIGE study on administrative data shows that the current regulatory framework is insufficient to enable the collection of comparable data on violence against women, including data on victims and perpetrators, access to services for survivors of violence and institutions\u2019 response to their needs. The study also underlines the need for a harmonized approach to data collection among EU Member States. \u201cOur findings clearly highlight the need for a harmonized data among EU Member States that enable assessing the prevalence and measuring the effectiveness of the struggle to combat gender related violence,\u201d says EIGE\u2019s Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Murphy about the study, which is being presented at the conference for the first time. About the conference Eliminating Violence against Women \u2013 Intersectoral Approaches and Actions The conference, taking place in Vienna on 25\u201326 November 2013, brings together more than 200 participants to review the findings of new research on violence against women, the urgent need for reliable data on the problem, and the need for all sectors of society to work together to fight and prevent gender-based violence. How to introduce new international guidelines for health care facilities when treating victims of violence, and case studies of successful projects and measures are also on the agenda. Representatives of international organizations, as well as experts from academe and civil society, are participating. The conference is jointly organized by the City of Vienna, EIGE and the WHO Regional Office for Europe. Campaign against gender violence 25 November is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and the start of a global campaign 16 Days of Activism against Gender Violence. To mark this occasion, conference delegates raised the anti-violence flag of women\u2019s rights organization Terre des Femmes at Vienna\u2019s city hall, with executive city councillors Sandra Frauenberger and Sonja Wehsely and representatives of a large number of nongovernmental organizations.

The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) today launched its Resource and Documentation Centre (RDC) with an EU-wide conference in Vilnius in the presence of EU Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science Maire Geoghegan-Quinn and Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Policy of Bulgaria, Lazar Lazarov. \u201cOur RDC will become the first place to search, to find, to inter-act and to learn about equality between women and men in the European Union\u201d Virginija Langbakk, Director of the Institute. EIGE collects, processes and makes available data, tools, methods, good practices and resources on gender equality and makes this information available via its RDC. It aims to assist policy makers and practitioners in locating key resources on gender equality. It also facilitates the exchange of knowledge amongst those with an interest in gender equality policy and practice and provides a space to discuss and debate key issues on gender equality. The long-term objective is to bring together in one place the memory of all gender equality work at EU and Member State level and to make it accessible to all, actively fostering cooperation between gender equality actors across the EU. EIGE\u2019s Resource and Documentation Centre is built around three main functions: Online and physical documentation centre : 240,000 gender equality related resources that were, until now, scattered across a multitude of sources throughout the EU; Knowledge centre: gender equality knowledge produced by the Institute including specialised research and databases; European network on gender equality - EuroGender: an online collaborative platform where decision makers, experts and other stakeholders can debate gender equality issues and share their expertise and resources. Knowledge of resources on gender equality is crucial to strengthen the capacity for gender mainstreaming in policies and programs. Access to reliable and comparable gender statistics are universally considered to be important levers for achieving de facto gender equality. The mission of the European Institute for Gender Equality is to be(come) the knowledge centre on gender equality for the European Union and the Member States. A multitude of gender equality actors exist at EU and Member State level. The vast amount of data, knowledge and resources they produce or process in the field of gender equality are not always easily identified or accessible to decision makers, practitioners, researchers or citizens. The European Institute for Gender Equality has managed to create a single gateway to access this information. For this purpose EIGE teamed up with five documentation centres and libraries specialised in women and gender issues, namely: Amazone - Resource Centre for Equality between Women and Men in Brussels; Atria - institute on gender equality and women\u2019s history in Amsterdam; Cid-femmes et genre - Information and documentation centre for women and gender issues in Luxembourg; Gender Library of the Centre for trans disciplinary Gender Studies at Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu BerlinGender Library; KvinnSam - National Resource Library for Gender Studies at Gothenburg University; Kvinfo \u2013 The Danish Centre for Research and Information on Gender, Equality and Diversity The uniqueness of EIGE\u2019s Resource and Documentation Centre is complemented by other important like: Quick and easy access to more than 238 000 resources on gender equality; Multilingual resources (English, French, German, Dutch, Swedish \u2013 more languages to follow) The RDC is available via /rdc Press release in .pdf format", "url": "https://eige.europa.eu/news/gateway-eu-gender-equality-knowledge-launched"}, {"id": "EIGE_NEWS_0131", "date": "2013-09-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Visit to EIGE by the European Parliament's Committee on Budgets", "text": "The European Institute for Gender Equality welcomes the EP Committee on Budgets forits first visit to EIGE, on 18 Sep 2013.

It would also improve media content.\u2019 - says Virginija Langbakk, Director of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). EIGE\u2019snewreport 'Advancing gender equality in decision-making in media organisations' presents for the first time reliable and comparable EU-wide data on women and men in decision making in the media sector. The report will support policymakers and all relevant institu\u00adtions in their efforts to achieve gender equality. Challenging the glass ceiling EIGE\u2019s report points out that the organisational culture within media structures remains largely masculine, despite the fact that women considerably outnumber men in university-level education in this field and constitute nearly half the workforce within the media industry. Women continue to be significantly underrepresented in decision-making structures, both at operational levels as senior managers and at strategic levels, as chief executive officers and board members of major media organisations across the EU Member States. There is a significant difference between the private and public media sectors. In public media organisations the ratio of women to men occupying strategic decision-making position is only 1 in 5, whereas in private media organisations it decreases to only 1 in 10. Within the decision-making boards of media organisations women represent only 25% of all members. Internal equality policies for gender balance in decision making Despite the fact that organisations implementing gender equality policies and measures are more likely to have a higher proportion of women in strategic decision-making positions, EIGE\u2019s research shows that gender-equality plans, diversity policies and codes of conduct exist only in around a quarter of the surveyed media organisations. Only few organisations have formal mechanisms in place to monitor their gender equality policies. Sixteen percent of the surveyed organisations have a committee responsible for equality-policy issues, 14% have an equality/diversity officer and 9% an equality/diversity department. In general, public media organisations are more likely than private ones to have a gender equality policy, code or measure in place. Whose freedom is protected? Self-regulation has been the main strategy for the media industry. \u2018Many politicians have been reluctant to take action concerning gender equality in the media because there is a risk that it could be seen as a form of censorship or a way of limiting freedom of expression, if the media industry becomes more regulated. On the other hand, it is time to think whose freedom of expression is being protected or hampered. Until now news agendas have been mostly about men for men.\u2019 says Dr Maria Edstr\u00f6m, expert on women and the media from the University of Gothenburg. More women in the media \u2013 to shape gender-equal society Based on EIGE\u2019s report, the Council of the European Union has adopted conclusions on \u2018Advancing Women\u2019s Roles as Decision-Makers in the Media\u2019 and took note of the first indicators for monitoring the implementation of the area of Women and the Media of the Beijing Platform for Action within the EU Member States. In line with the findings presented in EIGE\u2019s report, the Council calls on the Member States and the European Commission to take active measures to foster gender equality at all levels, including women\u2019s advancement in decision-making roles in the media industry. The Council also calls for enhancing awareness of gender equality within the media sector and the exchange of good practices between Member States in this area, which will support the process of achieving a gender-equal society.

The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) is launching the first Gender Equality Index for the European Union. \u2018The Gender Equality Index shows differences in outcomes between women and men at the individual level in EU Member States,\u2019 says Virginija Langbakk, the Director of EIGE. \u2018This unique measurement tool supports evidence-based policy-making and indicates where political priorities should be shifted to accelerate the process of achieving a gender-equal Europe.\u2019 Although gender equality values have been recognised since its earliest days, the European Union is only halfway towards a gender-equal society, with an average EU score of 54 (where 1 stands for no gender equality and 100 for full gender equality). \u2018Gender-sensitive statistics help us better understand the hurdles we need to bring down to make all citizens truly equal, and the Gender Equality Index does just that. In our fight against unemployment, improving job opportunities for women is a matter of fairness, but it is also good for society and good for the economy,\u2019 says Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council. The Gender Equality Index, proposed by the European Commission and developed by the European Institute for Gender Equality, provides scores for each Member State and presents an EU average in each of the following critical areas of gender equality: work, money, knowledge, time, power and health. The areas of violence and intersecting inequalities are also considered as critical areas, but treated separately as they adopt a different perspective. \u2018I'm very glad that EIGE has developed a Gender Equality Index,\u2019 says Michael Gustafson, Chair of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality of the European Parliament. \u2018It enables each Member State to evaluate and compare amongst each other the progress they\u2019ve made in various fields of gender equality, as well as where progress is most needed. I hope this tool will be used extensively and that it will lead to better knowledge and, most importantly, to further progress in gender equality.\u2019 Lowest level of gender equality in decision-making The lowest score is in the area of power in decision-making, with an average score of only 38 at EU level: the EU and Member States need more women in decision-making.The greatest distance from gender equality is apparent in the representation of women and men on boards of the largest quoted companies, with an EU average score of only 23.3. Measures such as a quota system could improve gender equality in this area and lead to a positive effect on all other areas. Equal share of caring activities crucial to reaching the EU\u2019s employment target The European Union could more quickly reach the employment target set out in the 2020 growth strategy \u2013 at least 75% employment rate of the EU population aged 20-64 \u2013 by improving gender equality in the area of time spent on unpaid caring and domestic activities. Women\u2019s participation in the labour market is limited because of their disproportionate involvement in caring roles. The Gender Equality Index shows wide differences between women and men in this area, with an average score of only 39 at the EU level \u2013 well below halfway towards gender equality. To ensure sustainable growth for Europe, it is important to assure the equal share of hours spent on providing care between women and men. In parallel with creating new employment opportunities, it is crucial to improve childcare provision, as stated in Barcelona targets, and to intensify efforts to increase the involvement of fathers in childcare. Combating violence against women seriously hampered by data gaps EU institutions are committed to making the EU free from violence for all, but the Gender Equality Index shows that there are no comparable sex-disaggregated data in this area at EU level. Because gender-based violence against women remains one of the most pervasive human rights violations of our time, one that is rooted in gender inequalities and reinforces them, the Gender Equality Index calls for all policymakers to address this gap.

The project is a continuation of a mapping exercise on gender training in the EU and Croatia that was completed in 2012 with the European Conference on \u2018Advancing Gender Training to Support Effective Gender Mainstreaming\u2019. In a nutshell the findings from Phase I of the study are as follows: The implementation of gender mainstreaming has been patchy in EU Member States and often there is no political will to prioritise gender equality issues. Investments in gender training are not systematic and the resources are often limited because of the cuts in public spending. Training programmes provided to civil servants tend to be generic and theoretical, not tailored to specific policy areas and the day to day work of participants. The quality of gender training varies both within and across Member States as certification mechanisms for gender trainers rarely exist in the EU. Gender training programmes are not systematically evaluated though qualitative evidence suggests that they support effective mainstreaming if they are practical and tailored to the training participants\u2019 policy area of work and day-to-day activities. Read the full summary of the first year's findings. Moving to Phase II Taking these issues into account, Phase II of the study seeks to explore: The key features that contribute to effective gender training; Why gender training is not always effective; and The extent to which effective gender training contributes to the implementation of gender mainstreaming strategies in the European Union. Methodologically, to investigate these issues in the in-depth phase the study team conducts case study research in five EU Member States (Austria, Germany, Greece, Finland and Sweden) as well as face-to-face and online consultation meetings with civil servants in EU institutions and Member States as well as gender trainers. Through case studies research and stakeholder consultations the study team will examine the relationship between quality standards and effectiveness of training and make recommendations about the future of gender capacity development in Europe and how EIGE can support Member States and EU institutes in their efforts to promote equality.

The database is a freely searchable directory of over 200 gender trainers from all over the EU. The initial list of gender trainers, which was further on updated and developed under this project, was entrusted to EIGE by the OPERA team of researchers of the QUING project. EIGE\u2019s database of gender trainers was developed along with EIGE\u2019s database of gender training resources as part of the study on Gender training in the EU: Mapping, research and stakeholders\u2019 engagement (2012-2013). What does it offer? The database of gender trainers: provides practical and updated information about over 200 providers offering gender training in 27 EU Member States and Croatia; covers a wide range of expertise in fields such as gender analysis, gender impact assessment, gender budgeting etc.; encompasses over 80 thematic areas of expertise of trainers including gender mainstreaming, education and training, employment and social affairs, violence, and gender stereotypes; provides access to contact details of gender trainers. How does it function? Users of the database can view a list of active trainers by undertaking standard or advanced searches through name, email, country, language, and competence areas. Search results present the trainers\u2019 profile and contact details. The Gender Trainers database is hosted in EIGE's European Network for Gender Equality - EuroGender. Who can benefit from it and how? The trainers\u2019 database serves those who have a gender training need as well as those who have expertise in gender issues and offer professional training in this area. If someone is looking for a gender training provider, the trainers' database offers a user-friendly, accessible information system that enables them to: find and review training providers\u2019 profiles based on country, language, thematic area of expertise, or keyword; select services from a wide pool of trainers in various fields and themes of expertise to match someone\u2019s particular area of training need; efficiently commission work to training professionals to train the workforce of different organisations. If you are looking to network and advertise your training services, the trainers' database is the ideal platform for you to publicise your expertise among organisations commissioning gender training from all around Europe.

The Commission organised a high-level roundtable event to discuss how the European Union can help Member States to eradicate the practice \u2013 thought to have affected several hundred thousand women in the EU. The Commissioners were joined by Members of the European Parliament and the world\u2019s leading anti-FGM campaigners, including \u2018desert flower\u2019 Waris Dirie, Khady Koita and Chantal Compaor\u00e9 \u2013 First Lady of Burkina Faso. In parallel, today the Commission launched a public consultation calling for views on how best to develop measures at EU level to fight female genital mutilation. The consultation will run until 30 May 2013. The Commission has also announced EUR 3.7 million in funding to support Member States' activities to raise awareness of violence against women and a further EUR 11.4 million for NGOs and others working with victims. \u201cToday the European Commission is joining forces with some very inspiring women to call for zero tolerance for female genital mutilation. This is an extremely harmful practice which violates the human rights of women and girls. The EU will fight to end female genital mutilation \u2013 not only on International Women's Day, but on all 365 days of the year,\u201d said Vice-President Reding, the EU\u2019s Justice Commissioner.\"I call on everyone with an insight in this area to share their views on how to best tackle female genital mutilation.\" \"Female genital mutilation is a severe violation of human rights. The risk of being subjected to this practice should constitute a valid reason for granting asylum or humanitarian protection. In our asylum legislation, we are paying particular attention to women and girls who are seeking asylum due to the threat of physical mutilation. Women and girls who are at risk of female genital mutilation, or parents who fear persecution because they refuse to have their child undergo this practice should be given suitable protection in Europe,\" said Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, EU Commissioner for Home Affairs. New reporton FGM Today's high-level roundtable discussion on FGM comes as the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) releases a new report on female genital mutilation in the EU, following a request by Vice-President Reding. The report concludes that FGM is by nature a global, transnational phenomenon. While there is no hard evidence of FGM being practised in the EU, thousands of women and girls living in the EU have been subjected to the practice either before moving to the EU or while travelling outside the EU. The report finds that there are victims, or potential victims, in at least 13 EU countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Spain, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and the UK. However, it also highlights the need for rigorous data as a basis for tackling the problem. Eradicating FGM will require a range of actions focusing on data collection, prevention, protection of girls at risk, prosecution of perpetrators and provision of services for victims, says the report. Victims of FGM can rely on protection under the EU\u2019s Victims Rights Directive, adopted on 4 October 2012, which explicitly refers to FGM as a form of gender-based violence (IP/12/1066). But while all EU Member States and Croatia have legal provisions in place to prosecute the perpetrators of FGM, either under general or specific criminal laws, prosecutions are very rare. This is due to diffculties detecting cases, gathering sufficient evidence, a reluctance to report a crime and, above all, a lack of knowledge about female genital mutilation. EIGE has therefore also published a report identifying a series of good practices from nine Member States in combating FGM. The report gives examples of successful policies and projects, including: A Dutch project to prevent FGM by bringing together healthcare professionals, police, schools, child protection services and migrant organisations; A French organisation which focuses on bringing prosecutions in cases of FGM by acting as a \u2018civil party\u2019 in trials; A specialised health service in the UK with 15 clinics that cater to the specific needs of women affected by FGM. Background Female genital mutilation (FGM) comprises all procedures involving partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons, as defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO). FGM is carried out for cultural, religious and/or social reasons on young girls between infancy and age 15. FGM constitutes a form of child abuse and violence against women and girls; it has severe short-term and long-term physical and psychological consequences. In the EU countries where women victims or girls and women at risk of FGM live, the practice mainly occurs during a stay in the country of origin and very rarely in the territory of the EU. The Commission adopted a \u2018Strategy for equality between women and men 2010-2015\u2019 on 21 September 2010, setting out a series of priorities for gender equality, including ending gender-based violence. The strategy included a specific reference to female genital mutilation. On 6 February 2013 which is the International Day against Female Genital Mutilation, the European Commission reaffirmed its strong commitment to eradicating this extremely harmful practice (MEMO/13/67).

The study will provide an overview of the situation concerning female genital mutilation in the 27 Member States and Croatia. Female genital mutilation is high on the agenda of gender equality policy makers in the EU. It should be: it is a form of gender-based violence that continues to be, also in Europe, one of the most brutal and most difficult to combat forms of violence against women and girls. The main objectives of the study are to fill the gaps in data and knowledge about female genital mutilation in the EU and support the development of strategies to combat FGM. One of the main conclusions is the lack of systematic collection of data on the prevalence of FGM in EU-27 and Croatia. Moreover, FGM-practising communities are insufficiently included in the development and implementation of policies on FGM, civil society organisations that are intensely involved in FGM prevention measures are seriously underfunded, and the knowledge about FGM among professionals who are in contact with girls and women at risk of FGM and victims of FGM is insufficient. The European Institute of Gender Equality (EIGE), being the European knowledge centre on gender equality issues, committed itself strongly to this study: it was carried out upon a direct request of Vice-President Reding. Female genital mutilation is a violation of the human rights of women and girls and a cruel form of gender-based violence. The European Commission\u2019s \u2018Strategy for equality between women and men 2012 \u2212 2015\u2019 specifically mentions female genital mutilation as a harmful practice and a form of violence against women. In line with previous resolutions in which it strongly condemned female genital mutilation, the European Parliament adopted the \u2018Resolution on ending female genital mutilation\u2019 in June 2012. With this report EIGE brings a unique added value for better informed policymaking concerning female genital mutilation. The results of the study will be published in a report entitled \u2018Female genital mutilation in the European Union and Croatia\u2019, together with country profiles in all EU-languages, good practices and a database on methods, tools and resources, made available on EIGE's website.

The final results of the study will be available in August 2013. Why do we need a study on administrative data collection on gender-based violence? The crucial role of data collection in the fight against gender-based violence has been increasingly recognised by governments, international and regional organisations, civil society, researchers and experts on this issue. While countless women in the European Union continue to be affected by gender-based violence (GBV), differences in the definitions and data collection methodologies across the Member States make it difficult to obtain a comprehensive and clear picture of the nature, extent and consequences of gender-based violence in the EU. For instance, only nine out of 28 Member States\u2019 crime statistics provide specific data on intimate partner violence, based on the relationship between victim and perpetrator. EIGE\u2019s Study will increase the knowledge base about gender-based violence and the sources of administrative data on gender-based violence across the European Union and Croatia. Who might find the study results useful? The study assesses the availability, quality and comparability of administrative sources of data on GBV. It seeks to support policy makers across Europe in the fight against GBV by providing guidelines and suggesting methodological tools/indicators to improve and harmonise administrative data collection across the EU. How the research is being conducted? The study, which covers the 27 EU Member States as well as Croatia, is being carried out by Matrix, an European public policy consultancy, in conjunction with external experts and a team of 28 national researchers responsible for desk research and field research in each country. Acknowledging a wide variety of forms of gender-based violence but also recognising the limitations inherent to any piece of research, the study concentrates on eight specific forms of gender-based violence: intimate partner violence sexual assault, rape, sexual harassment, stalking, female genital mutilation, forced marriage, and honour-based crimes. In order to better understand the challenges concerning administrative data collection on GBV the study started off reviewing existing publications from international, EU as well as national sources. So as to gain inside information and a more practical perspective on this issue, which might not be possible through the review of national and regional literature, the study foresees in-depth interviews with more than 150 stakeholders across the European Union, who are involved in or knowledgeable of administrative data collection with regards to gender-based violence. This includes representatives from health services, law enforcement agencies, court systems and social support services. The interview programme will be launched in February 2013. Following the initial analysis of the results, a focus group will be organised in late spring in order to reflect on existing issues and to discuss the feasibility of administrative data collection at EU level. The aim is to identify possible steps to overcome existing challenges in administrative data collection, which would allow EIGE and policy makers across the EU to obtain up-to-date and comparable data on different types of violence against women in the EU.", "url": "https://eige.europa.eu/news/new-study-gender-based-violence"}, {"id": "EIGE_NEWS_0147", "date": "2012-12-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIGE will launch a Gender Equality Index for Europe in June 2013", "text": "Equality between women and men is a fundamental value of the European Union and is recognised as vital to economic growth, prosperity and competitiveness. The effectiveness of the policies developed to achieve this needs to be evaluated. The development and dissemination of EU-wide, comparable and reliable gender statistics and indicators have greatly contributed to this better monitoring and assessment of progress in the EU. To supplement these, the creation of a composite indicator, to provide a synthetic measure of gender equality as a multi-dimensional concept, was initially introduced by the European Commission in its policy document \u201cThe Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men 2006-2010\u201d and in the Action Plan of the Commission Strategy for Equality between Women and Men 2010-2015 that followed. To implement these, the construction of the European Gender Equality Index became one of the major assignments attributed to the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) in its Mid-Term Programme 2010-2012. The European Gender Equality Index is a sophisticated tool that synthesises the complexity of gender equality into a user-friendly and easily interpretable measure. It is formed by combining gender indicators together, according to a conceptual framework, into a single summary measure. The domains of the Index consist of six core domains (work, health, money, knowledge, time, power) that are aggregated into a single measure and complemented by two satellites domains (intersecting inequalities and violence). It has been developed to provide a measure of how much the EU overall and each Member State has come towards achieving gender equality. By focusing on gender gaps, the Index distances itself from the national context, focusing instead on where gender equality meets the smallest gaps.

The women on this list all fulfil stringent criteria for Corporate Governance as defined by publicly listed companies and are well qualified and ready to go on boards as of today. This ever growing list of \"Board Ready Women\" \u2013 which will now be consultable online for corporations and for executive search companies \u2013 makes it clear that there are more than enough eminently qualified women to help lead Europe\u2019s and the world\u2019s corporations into the 21st century and that it is now time to shatter the glass ceiling that keeps these women from ascending to board of directors positions. \"We need to use all of our society\u2019s talents to ensure that Europe\u2019s economy takes off. That is why the European Commission has proposed a European law for boosting gender balance in company board rooms,\" said Vice-President Viviane Reding, EU Justice Commissioner. \"I often hear the argument that there are not enough qualified women to occupy positions in the boardroom. Today European Business Schools and their colleagues around the world are shattering those myths as well as glass ceilings! The list shows that the qualified women are there \u2013 8 000 of them. Companies should now make use of this untapped pool of talent.\" The \"Global Board Ready Women\" searchable database list and forum will be administered by the Financial Times Non-Executive Directors\u2019 Club on the global business platform, LinkedIn. All women listed in the Global Board Ready Women (GBRW) searchable database are suitable to be considered for publicly listed company board-level positions and meet a clear set of criteria as developed and defined over the last year and a half by the organization members of the European Business Schools/Women on Board initiative (see below). Every application to be part of this database is formally assessed and reviewed and only those women who meet the criteria are accepted. Participating Business Schools and Professional organizations apply the same criteria for their participating Alumnae and Members. Notably, all women on the list have at least five years\u2019 experience in one or more of the following roles: Chair and/or NED of listed/private corporations CEO, COO, CFO or other C-suite exec/director level in listed/private corporations Family member and controlling shareholder of boards of large family companies Director of government agencies Director of non-profit orgs Institutional investment community senior professional Professional firms senior partner serving boards and their committees as clients Entrepreneur Senior academics with relevant experience Background In November 2012 the European Commission proposed legislation to improve gender balance on company boards based on merit and qualification. The proposed Directive sets a minimum objective of 40% by 2020 for members of the under-represented sex for non-executive members of the boards of publicly listed companies in Europe, or 2018 for listed public undertakings. The proposal also includes, as a complementary measure, a \"flexi quota\": an obligation for listed companies to set themselves individual, self-regulatory targets regarding the representation of both sexes among executive directors to be met by 2020 (or 2018 in case of public undertakings). Qualification and merit will remain the key criteria for a job on the board. The proposed Directive establishes a minimum harmonisation of corporate governance requirements, as appointment decisions will have to be based on objective qualifications criteria. Inbuilt safeguards will make sure that there is no unconditional, automatic promotion of the under-represented sex. In line with the European Court of Justice's case law on positive action, preference shall be given to the equally qualified under-represented sex, unless an objective assessment taking into account all criteria specific to the individual candidates tilts the balance in favour of the candidate of the other sex. Member States will also have to lay down appropriate and dissuasive sanctions for companies in breach of the proposed Directive. The EU's competence to legislate in gender equality matters dates back to 1957 (see SPEECH/12/702). Council Recommendations on promoting the balanced participation of men and women in the decision-making process date back to 1984 and 1996. In addition, the European Parliament has called for legally binding quotas at EU level in several Resolutions. A report by the Commission in March 2012 showed that, across the EU, company boards are currently dominated by one gender. There are also big differences between countries, with women making up 27% of board members in the largest Finnish companies and 26% in Latvia, but only 3% in Malta and 4% in Cyprus. Progress is only visible in countries that have introduced legally binding laws for company boards. France, which introduced a legal quota in January 2011, accounts alone for more than 40% of the total EU-wide change recorded between October 2010 and January 2012.

EPSCO calls on the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Member States to improve support services for victims of violence The adopted conclusions highlight that domestic violence is a form of gender-based violence and a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women. The conclusions reaffirm that neither custom, tradition, culture, privacy nor religion can be invoked to justify violence against women or to avoid the obligations of the Member States with respect to its prevention and elimination and the prosecution of perpetrators. The Council of the European Union calls on the European Commission and the Member States to develop a European Strategy for preventing and combating all forms of violence against women in accordance with the Council Conclusions on the Eradication of Violence Against Women in the European Union adopted in 2010. It also calls on the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Member States to sign, ratify and implement the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, without prejudice to the possible future negotiations on possible EU accession. Taking note of EIGE\u2019s report \u201cReview of the Implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action in the EU Member States: Violence against Women Victim Support\u201d, the Council calls to ensure that support services for victims of violence are in adequate supply and apply gender equality perspective in particular with a view to protecting and empowering women and that such services are tailored to their specific immediate and long-term needs and safety. The Council calls also to improve the collection and dissemination of comparable, reliable and regularly updated data on victims and perpetrators of all forms of violence against women at both national and the EU level and to make full use of the work of EIGE. EIGE\u2019s report gives data for evidence-based policy improvement EIGE\u2019s report aims to support policy makers and all relevant institutions in their efforts to combat and prevent violence against women, by providing them with reliable and comparable data and information for effective actions and evidence-based policy improvement. \u201cOur research shows \u2013 says Virginija Langbakk, Director of EIGE \u2013 that current support services do not meet the needs of women victims of violence.

Insufficient specialised services for women victims of violence and the absence of mandatory gender-sensitive training for professional helpers of victims and perpetrators are only a few of the reasons. In fact, only 12 out of the 27 EU Member States legally foresee state funding of specialised services for women victims of violence. EIGE\u2019s report will be available online in December 2012. More information on EIGE\u2019s work in the area of gender-based violence: http://www.eige.europa.eu/content/activities/gender-based-violence European commitments Nine out of ten victims of intimate partner violence in the EU are women. The number of women victims of physical intimate partner violence in the EU Member States ranges between 12 and 35 percentage. The EU and its institutions are committed to combat violence against women. The commitment is affirmed in: the Women\u2019s Charter (2010), the European Commission\u2019s Strategy for Equality between Women and Men 2010\u22122015 and the Action Plan of the Stockholm Programme for 2010\u22122014. The Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (known also as the Istanbul Convention) offers the most recent and comprehensive international legal instruments to combat violence against women. The Convention requires states to provide general and immediate, short and long-term specialised services for women victims of violence and to support their funding. Support is insufficient EIGE\u2019s Report \u201cViolence against Women: Victim Support\u201d (full title: \u201cReview of the Implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action by the EU Member States: Violence against Women Victim Support\u201ddescribes the current (2012) status of the specialised services for women victims of intimate partner violence in the 27 EU Member States and Croatia. It also presents recommendations for improving these services. The report concludes that only specialised services can fully meet the specific needs of women victims of violence (including safe accommodation, protection, healthcare, legal, psychological and employment counselling, social and financial support), and support women\u2019s recovery from trauma. \u201cEIGE\u2019s research shows \u2013 says Virginija Langbakk, Director of EIGE \u2013 that current support services do not meet the needs of women victims of violence. The specialised services are insufficient and unequally distributed in certain countries and the funding for them is inconsistent. Moreover, training for professionals working with victims of violence is not yet mandatory, systematic or gender-sensitive.\u201d The report points out that 26 Member States and Croatia have counselling centres/services for victims of violence, but only eight Member States and Croatia fulfill the recommended ratio of one counselling centre/service per 50,000 women. Although 17 Member States have helplines for women victims of violence, only six of these helplines are free of charge and available 24/7, which are the basic requirements highlighted in the Istanbul Convention. Member States strive for change \u201cIt is important to highlight \u2013 says Virginija Langbakk \u2013 that the vast majority of the EU Member States have developed and implemented national action plans to combat domestic violence. They have also included intimate partner violence into the penal codes and adopted protection orders. Some Member States have demonstrated significant improvements in service provision, such as the provision of services for women facing multiple discrimination (including migrant, young, older, ethnic, LBT women and also women with disabilities). However \u2013 she adds \u2013 there is still space for improvement: majority of national action plans lack monitoring and evaluation systems; only four Member States introduced gender-based definition of domestic violence into their criminal codes and in many Member States the protection orders are not implemented effectively. Moreover, the funding of specialised services is instable and has suffered from the current financial crisis. Funding of specialised services for women victims of violence is ensured in the legislation of only 12 Member States.\u201d Recommendations Based on the findings of the report, the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) recommends the Member States the following actions: Acknowledge the need for specialised gender-specific services to support the complex range of immediate and long-term needs of women survivors of violence and their children. Guarantee sustainable funding for specialised services, such as women\u2019s shelters, helplines and counselling services. Safeguard the independence and funding of specialised women\u2019s non-governmental organisations delivering support services for women victims of violence. Mandate systematic and continuous training of professionals on violence against women and secure funding for it. Ensure that services are accessible to women facing multiple discrimination, including migrant, young, older, ethnic, LBT women and also women with disabilities. Monitor and evaluate regularly the coordination of public support system for victims of domestic violence. Develop national definitions and classifications to be used for surveys, research and administrative statistics; to ensure their consistent use at the national, regional, European and international levels and guarantee regular data collection. The report is a part of EIGE\u2019s broader work in the area of gender based violence \u2013 aiming at supporting policy makers and all relevant institutions in their efforts to combat and prevent violence, by providing them with reliable and comparable data and information on gender-based violence in the European Union. The subject was chosen by the Cyprus Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The eradication of all forms of violence against women is one of the strategic objectives of the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA), adopted at the 4th World Conference on Women in1995. The European Council acknowledged the EU\u2019s commitment towards the BPfA and expressed its intent to review its implementation regularly across the Member States. The European Institute for Gender Equality plays an important role in this process.

The Resource & Documentation Centre (RDC) of the European Institute for Gender Equality The goal of the RDC is to collect, analyse and disseminate relevant, objective, comparable and reliable information on gender equality. The primary beneficiaries are policy makers and implementers at the EU and Member States levels. Other targeted users include: research organisations, Social Partners, Civil Society organisations, media and, ultimately, the European Union citizens. EIGE cooperates with well-established documentation centres and gender networks to reinforce their work by creating a central resource hub, fostering the collection, organization and dissemination of gender knowledge across existing networks. Gender-based violence Gender-based violence, in all its forms, affects mostly women. It reflects and reinforces inequalities between women and men and remains a major problem in the European Union. The European Parliament resolution on the elimination of violence against women (26 November 2009) and the Council of the EU\u2019s conclusions on the eradication of violence against women (8 March 2010) highlighted the lack of available and comparable data on violence against women in the European Union. The European Institute for Gender Equality carries out research on gender-based violence so that it can provide policy makers and experts with existing data, information and resources on the prevention of and combating gender-based violence. Violence against women is one of the topics of the Cypriot Presidency of the European Union, in the framework of reviewing the EU commitments regarding the Beijing Platform for Action.

Gender mainstreaming is not a goal in itself but a political strategy, which requires that gender concerns are integrated into all policy decisions, legal frameworks, activities and programmes. In the context of EU policy-making,gender mainstreaming has been a policy priority since 1996. In order for gender mainstreaming to be implemented effectively, the right expertise and tools need to be in place; training, therefore, has a central role in supporting actors to fulfill their mandates. After gaining administrative independence in 2010, the European Institute for Gender Equality set to support institutions at national and EU level in their efforts to promote gender mainstreaming. Gender training, in particular disseminating resources (e.g. training manuals, toolkits, guidelines etc.) and good practices, is a priority area for the Institute in this endeavour. What do we mean by Gender Training? Gender Training is an educational tool employed by EU and MS institutions that targets actors normally involved in policy-making at all levels of governance with an aim to develop their gender (mainstreaming) competence. Gender Training refers to a range of gender awareness-raising and training activities, starting with the general awareness- raising courses for all the staff (including the management) and ending with specific training sessions aimed at transferring specialized knowledge (including methods and techniques) on how to put gender equality into practice to specific set of actors. Why Gender Training? Gender Mainstreaming has to bring change in policies, strategies, activities; Ordinary policy makers in various fields often lack gender expertise/competence; Gender training is the main tool employed to ensure necessary knowledge of actors in policy processes and thus improve gender mainstreaming; There is a need to provide better access to gender trainers and available resources and information on gender training across the European Union; Gender equality experts have expressed a need to set minimum quality standards for gender training at a number of occasions. What are the objectives of this project? To collect reliable and comprehensive information on theactivities, actors and resources related to gender training in the EU-27and Croatia; To identify good practices in gender training in the EU-27 andCroatia; To foster a discussion on the quality standards for gender trainingin the European Union; To support policy makers to access high quality tools. What are the anticipated outputs of the project? Through collection and dissemination of information on gender trainers, gender training materials and good practices, EIGE aims to support the transnational learning process and contribute to building the gender capacity of relevant actors. The study report on gender training in the European Union will look at policy developments and commitments, the scale and key elements of gender training in practice, reflect on the competences of gender trainers and the reasons for the lack of quality and gaps in training provision across the EU identifying gaps and needs, providing recommendations for further developments in the area of gender training. Country factsheets will summarise the developments in the field of gender training in all EU member states and Croatia. The EU-wide online database of individual gender trainers and training organisations will make easily accessible the practical information on gender training in all 27 EU Member States and Croatia through EIGE's Resource and Documentation Centre the database of available training resources collected across EU-27 and Croatia, that will contain materials developed by or for staff in public administrations to carry out gender mainstreaming. Identified good practices on gender training will present examples of effective ways to develop competence and capacity to mainstream gender. The in-depth research report will expand the knowledge base on a number of previously unexplored qualitative aspects related to gender training. How do we facilitate discussions on gender training? The institutes aims to bring together relevant actors, including policy makers and staff of public administrations, gender trainers, experts and researchers for a more effective and sustainable exchange of information and expertise. Online discussion The online discussion on gender training in the EU was held on 25-26 September 2012, using EIGE\u2019s new technical platform EuroGender. The discussion was facilitated by Kelly Shephard, Editorial Manager, IDS Knowledge Services and supported by Jenny Birchall and Alyson Brody, senior members of the BRIDGE team. The objective of the forum was two-fold: To take stock of the present realities with regards to Gender Training in the EU. To better understand the needs of various actors in the field of gender training and explore how to improve the quality and increase its effectiveness. The discussion brought together 33 people who submitted a total of 220 responses on a wide range of gender training related issues. European conference On 13-14 November 2012, EIGE is holding a European conference \u2018Advancing Gender Training to Support Effective Gender Mainstreaming\u2019 in Vilnius, Lithuania. The conference will bring together: the representatives of institutions that commission gender training, gender trainers, researchers and gender equality experts.

However, less focus is still given to their capacity to be drivers of change in the fight against climate change. A new report by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) highlights just how little women have been involved: On average, they hold just about one fourth of decision-making positions related to climate change in the public sector. The paper published on the Institute\u2019s website gives an overview of current research on the gender dimension of environmental issues which gained broader attention in recent years among experts and has slowly started to be recognised by the general public. \u201cWomen play an important role in environmental management and progress, full participation is therefore essential to achieve sustainable development. It should not only be a matter of justice to involve women\u201d, says Virginija Langbakk, director of EIGE, \u201cbut one of pure logic for women and men to stand side by side with men to tackle climate change.\u201d The report points out that while female participation in decision-making bodies on the international and EU level continues to improve accounting for around 40 per cent, women are much less involved within the EU member states. In public sectors of environment, transport and energy which are all relevant to climate change policies, more than 80 per cent of top level (ministerial) positions are held by men. Only Finland and Sweden have reached an equal number of women and men \u2013 the ideal setting according to EIGE. \u201cAny decision-making body performs better when it includes people from a range of perspectives and backgrounds. A complex matter such as climate change simply needs this diverse, holistic approach\u201d, Langbakk points out. The report has been part of the Institute\u2019s work on the review of the Beijing Platform for Action under the EU\u2019s Danish Presidency during the first half of 2012. In it researchers not only assessed the amount of women at the negotiation tables but also potential future involvement of females by taking into account the number of women graduates in natural science and technology. Here, the report highlights, changes have gone in the right direction, although women still opt for life sciences, a huge number, especially environmental sciences rather than technological fields which might be crucial in finding alternative solutions to tackle global warming. Overall, Langbakk concludes, women\u2019s lacking involvement in shaping a future in which they especially will have to cope with climate change, will harm society as a whole. \u201cSuch factors should become an integral part of climate change policy debates and decisions. Otherwise we as a society will continue to lack the right answers.\u201d The active participation of women and the integration of gender issues in environmental policies and actions are critical determinants for the implementation of the commitments of the Beijing Platform for Action (1995), the World Summit on Sustainable Development (2002), and the Millennium Development Goals.

Oh, I would like to say yes, but I as a scientist I must say \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 because this of course hasn\u2019t been proven. But we know that women today are not empowered enough and we have evidence that they are more concerned with climate change than men. So putting that together, me being me, I would answer \u2018maybe\u2019. In their recent report on women and climate change, the European Institute for Gender Equality, EIGE, focuses on the so-called gender dimension to climate change. Yes, this has become an area of growing interest although there are so many aspects to it. But in general it is about findings such as for one, as I said, women and men conceive climate change differently as they do almost every other issue. At the same time by making choices in their lives that are less harmful to the environment, women tend to live more climate-friendly lives. Can you give daily examples? Today we have all this data showing that the average woman\u2019s lifestyle produces less GHG gases than a man\u2019s. Women drive smaller cars, they drive less in general, they use public transport and they eat less meat. Some research suggests that women simply cannot afford the lifestyle of men, driving a bigger car for example. No, no, I don\u2019t think it is a matter of resources. We have done research among women and men with the same income. Still the women drove smaller cars, ate differently etc.- all of the above. They were more conscious about their daily choices and habits. Where that comes from, I don\u2019t know. Some suggest it is biological \u2014 that women have a caring nature. Others tend to believe it is a product of gender stereotypes. I do believe it is more of the latter, but that those gender stereotypes are so strong and enduring that they have add some effect on female nature. It is fairly agreed today that people in the developing world will suffer more from the effects of climate change, women especially. But the same applies for Europe as well \u2026 That is right. During the heat wave in France for example more women died than men. It hasn\u2019t really been confirmed why but it could be that they were responsible for household tasks and thus more active, or it is just a matter of constitution. By the way, that is another aspect of why women need to be more involved \u2013 to give more visibility to their vulnerability. Women are in every sense at the frontline of climate change. But they need to go from vulnerable to visible to powerful. Since the urge to involve more women in climate talks has been identified in 1992 within the Beijing Platform for Action, there have been lots of initiatives for greater diversity. What has changed since then? Not very much, although things have of course improved: there are women now even at the most senior levels. But what we need is their equal participation, nothing less. Why doesn\u2019t this happen? Look at other power structures, you will find the same. It is for the same reasons that women are less represented on company boards or decision-making bodies in politics. Those in power won\u2019t give it up simply to have more justice. Is there a calculable loss to the lack of women participating in finding the solutions given that they are more aware and possibly more affected? I wouldn\u2019t know of that kind of research. But look, many believe that with climate change we will need to really enter into a catastrophe for everybody to understand the urgency of the issue. But the signs have already been there to suggest that the solutions so far, or maybe I should say \u2018our whole approach\u2019, does not work properly. What are key measures to get more women involved in decision- making? How drastic should these measures be regarding what is at stake? I usually don\u2019t get involved in political debate as such. But I think the key is to make women more visible in the public sphere. It sometimes takes everybody to work on that. In my country Sweden, TV stations now really make an effort to have female experts equally represented for interviews and programmes. Little things like that change the public perception drastically. In their report EIGE finds that education, mainly post-graduate, is the key factor for getting more women involved ... Yes, I certainly believe so. But some might argue that there is just too few women qualified enough to enter at these levels. That is not a valid argument for me. In the same report, EIGE suggests that while there are more female students than male, too few women enter scientific areas relevant to working on solutions for climate change. What might be the challenges for women in those areas of research? From my experience, there are several dimensions here. First of all, I think that women don\u2019t see that there are many job chances in those fields so they move on to different areas where there are more and realistic possibilities. But, on top of that, women are not being made to feel welcome. Former Irish President and first female head of state in Ireland Mary Robinson wrote in an article: \u201cWomen are the world\u2019s best climate change defence\u201d. Do you agree? What needs to be done to fully realise and exploit this potential? They are better \u2014 that I know! With men we still have to ask ourselves how to make them get rid of their big cars (laughs!). Now, on a serious note, I believe there is a political dimension to it. So, you could argue that on average a conservative man is more harmful to the environment than a socially-oriented woman. We know that women on average are more concerned with climate change - as they are with any other crisis.

During recent years FGM has gained considerable attention in the EU. In June 2012, the European Parliament adopted the Resolution on ending female genital mutilation. EIGE launched a \u201cStudy to map the current situation and trends of female genital mutilation in 27 EU Member States (MS) and Croatia\u201d on the request of EU Commissioner Viviane Reding. The results of the project will support policy makers in their efforts to follow the law obligation in this area and develop strategies for effective elimination of female genital mutilation in Europe. In June 2012 EIGE completed the first phase of the \u201cStudy to map the current situation and trends of female genital mutilation in 27 EU Member States (MS) and Croatia\u201d. It uniquely yields the first EU-wide map of information and data, legal and policy frameworks, actors, tools and methods in the area of female genital mutilation (FGM). The study will be completed by the end of 2012. During the first phase of the study information was collected through desk research in the 27 Member States and Croatia. Research identified the six most comparable indicators to evaluate and monitor the situation in the Member States in the area of FGM: FGM prevalence studies; asylum granted on FGM grounds; specific criminal law provisions on FGM; national action plans covering FGM; FGM-related child protection interventions and hospital/medical records on FGM. Country factsheets following the above mentioned indicators will be publicly available in the beginning of 2013. The main findings of the study\u2019s first phase show that despite the absence of reliable prevalence data, national policies are being developed in the Member States and Croatia to combat FGM. There are national action plans that deal exclusively with FGM in eight countries, namely: Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Sweden. Eleven Member States address FGM under national actions plans on violence against women and/or gender equality. Ten Member States have developed specific criminal legislation on FGM, whereas in other Member States the practice is prosecutable under general criminal law provisions dealing with bodily injury. In the majority of countries, the principle of extra-territoriality may be used. However, conditions for its application differ greatly across countries. It is worth mentioning that if the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence enters into force, it will become the first legally binding instrument that specifically mentions FGM. The number of actors dealing with FGM across EU-27 and Croatia varies significantly. The largest category consists of civil society organisations, which represent 42 per cent of all mapped actors. Slightly less than one-third of actors (30 per cent) constitute governmental bodies. Nine per cent of actors are FGM-specific, with the main focus on work towards complete abandonment of FGM practices or the provision of specific health care for FGM victims. EU\u2019s Daphne II programme played an important role combating FGM in the EU. During thein-depth research phase of EIGE\u2019s study, different national approaches taken toward tackling FGM in the EU were analysed and compared in order to identify good practices in the prevention, protection, prosecution, provision of services, partnership and prevalence. At present, a report is under preparation. In the frame of EIGE\u2019s study, an experience exchange meeting on \u2018Good Practices in the approach against Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in Europe\u2019 took place in London on 13 September 2012. Experts from the Member States, NGOs and international organisations who work on FGM discussed and shared ideas on how to best (delete) fight against FGM in Europe, in relation to prevention, protection, prosecution, provisions of services and partnerships.

EIGE\u2019s report introduces the first EU indicators in the area of women and environment. On 21 June, the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) is expected to adopt conclusions on gender equality and climate change prepared by the Danish Presidency on the basis of EIGE\u2019s report, including the first indicators. It will be an important input to the Rio + 20 international discussion on the green economy and sustainable development. On 20 June, Heads of State and Governments from all over the world will meet at the Rio + 20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development to renew political commitment for environmental protection, the green economy and sustainable development, and to address implementation gaps and emerging challenges. EIGE \u2013 the EU agency on gender equality \u2013 is present at the dialogue by presenting its report and conclusions on gender equality and climate change with the first EU indicators in this area. In its report \u201cGender Equality and Climate Change\u201d EIGE concludes that even if women are hit harder by the effects of climate change, their perspective and needs are not sufficiently taken into account. Women hold only aboutone fourth of climate-related decision-making positions in the public sector of the EU Member States. Among the Member States numbers vary from 8% of women in high-level decision-making positions on climate change policies (Italy) to 50% (in Sweden and Finland). The analysis concludes that despite the leading role of the EU in advancing the international negotiations on climate change, the gender dimension has largely been absent from policy initiatives and debates at the European and international levels. It has a negative impact on the quality of climate change policies and actions. In the European Commission DG Environment, women hold only 25% of high-level positions while in DG Mobility and Transport this figure falls to 13%. It is comparable with the lower levels of women found in national ministries in the transport sector \u2013 although the overall data sample within the European Commission is relatively small. EIGE highlights that more women are needed in climate change decision making to respond to climate change efficiently. The report also shows significant differences in the proportion of women and men graduates in scientific and technological fields. In 2009, women represented only 28% of the graduates in technological fields, 26% in transport services and 18% in engineering trades. In life sciences women represented 62% of graduates. The educational choices of women and men are known to be influenced by gender stereotypes, the absence of female role models in science and engineering, as well as insufficient gender-sensitive career counseling and guidance during upper-secondary education. Based on the findings of the report, EIGE recommends, among others, the following actions: developing strategies for integrating gender perspective into policy-making process, raising awareness about the relevance of gender issues for climate change and taking actions towards women\u2019s higher enrolment in science and technology-related fields of education. In the report EIGE introduces the first EU indicators in the area K of Beijing Platform for Action: Women and environment. The Beijing Platform for Action is a document that outlines the international community\u2019s commitment to address 12 areas of critical concern regarding gender equality. The new proposed indicators are an important tool to support successful evidence-based policy making and monitor the effectiveness of actions in the area of gender equality and environment. The indicators measure the involvement of women in decision-making on climate change in the public sector at national, EU and international level and segmentation of education in the fields related to environment and climate change at the EU and Member States level. The conclusions, prepared by the Danish Presidency on the basis of EIGE\u2019s report, including the proposed indicators, are expected to be adopted by The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) meeting 21 June. \u201cWomen and men cause climate change and contribute to the mitigation of the effects in different ways, which means that climate change policies can only deal with climate change effectively, if they systematically consider and respond to the needs and choices of both women and men\u201d says EIGE\u2019s director Virginija Langbakk.

The audience was greeted by the Minister of Social Security and Labour Donatas Jankauskas, and by the Director of the European Institute for Gender Equality Virginija Langbakk. 'Women and men are equivalent components of our society. It is only natural and socially right that in all areas of life they are granted equal rights and opportunities, that the status of both women and men is equal, and that the potential of both women and men is used for the growth of the national economy as well as the wellbeing of society in an efficient and equal manner', - said Minister Jankauskas. The Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men 2010-2014was presented by the vice-minister of the Ministry of Social Security and Labour and the Chairman of the Commission of Equal Opportunities for Women and Men Prof. Audrius Bitinas. 'Lithuania was the first country in Eastern and Central Europe in 1998 to pass a Law on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men, ensuring equal rights de jure and binding all state and municipal institutions to perform programmes and measures aimed at ensuring equal opportunities for women and men de facto. Consistent and systematic work implementing the National Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men has resulted in Lithuania exceeding the EU average in terms of most of the indicators of gender equality', \u2013 stated Vice-minister Bitinas. The targets of the National Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men 2010-2014 are to ensure that the provisions of the Law on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men are implemented in a consistent, complex, and methodical manner in all areas, as well as to ensure that European Union and international obligations are implemented in the field of equality of women and men. The plan for the implementation means of the programme was approved in order to achieve these targets. The upgrading and updating of the Information Portal and Electronic Network for Women, administered by the Women\u2019s Information Center, was supported in pursuance of the tasks of the aforementioned Programme. Implementation of this measure enabled better dissemination of information on the equality of women and men and also made more opportunities available for wider cooperation on gender equality issues. As part of the implementation of the Programme, in 2011 the European Institute for Gender Equality was able to launch the Lithuanian version of its web page, and in 2012 \u2013 to make it public and update the same.

In 2010 on 8 March, the Institute started collecting nominations for the Women of Europe resource pool which is used to highlight women\u2019s achievements and success stories. Inspiring experiences and stories of women from this pool are published on EIGE\u2019s website weekly. Select women who display outstanding experiences and achievements are chosen to be portrayed in EIGE\u2019s annual \u201cWomen Inspiring Europe\u201d calendar. Positive feedback from key stakeholders confirms a genuine interest in and support for this unique activity. EIGE\u2019s Director Virginija Langbakk commented: \"The achievements and contributions of women in society still receive less visibility and recognition when compared to those of men. EIGE collects and promotes the interesting and unique experiences of certain European women who serve as a source of inspiration for others. In the spirit of gender equality, women\u2019s achievements need to be placed at the forefront of societal growth.\" Supporting this initiative, EIGE welcomes nominees for its Women of Europe resource pool, including candidate nominees for EIGE\u2019s Calendar 2013. Nominees can be submitted by any EU institution, body, organisation or individual according to one of the following criteria: Evidence of breaking gender stereotypes \u2013 i.e. behaving differently, acting and thinking \"outside the (gender) box,\" Evidence of achieving recognition and visibility for her actions, Evidence of supporting women (promoting, encouraging). For each nominee a short biography and a photo should be sent to EIGE. Preferably, a written agreement should accompany the nomination, allowing EIGE use of their data in the event it should need to be made public (e.g. on EIGE\u2019s website, in social media or in EIGE\u2019s Calendar 2013).

The reasons for practicing female genital mutilation (FGM) often are based a mix of cultural, social and religious factors. The European Parliament resolution of 24 March 2009 on combating FGM in the EU clearly states that any form of FGM \u201ccan under no circumstances be justified by respect for cultural traditions of various kinds or initiation ceremonies\u201d. At present reliable and comparable data to present the scope of the problem is both scarce and what exist is also insufficient. For that reason the European Institute for Gender Equality has commissioned a study to map the current situation and trends of female genital mutilation in 27 EU Member States and Croatia. The main goal of the Study is to support and contribute to the future development of strategies for the elimination of different forms of violence against women. More specifically, this study will assess and analyse the current situation of female genital mutilation (FGM) in all 27 Member States of the European Union and Croatia focusing on: current policies and policy developments on FGM at EU level and at national level; current actors, their activities and good practices with regard to prevention of FGM, clinical care for women with FGM, protection and prosecution; existing data; gaps in data collection and recommendation how to fill the gap.

Other important points of discussion were the Europe 2020 strategy, reconciliation and violence against women. Over the course of two days the FEMM committee\u2019s visit to EIGE featured discussions on their cooperation. A number of issues were covered, with the FEMM committee delegation led by Ms. Edit Bauer, MEP from Slovakia. \u201cWe had a very good discussion on EIGE\u2019s main areas of engagement including violence against women, the future EU gender Equality Index, stereotypes, reconciliation of career, family life and private life and relation to the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy\u201d, states Virginija Langbakk, Director of EIGE. The link between the EU 2020 Strategy and Gender Equality is very visible according to Ms. Edit Bauer. In the Opinion paper on the \u201cDemographic challenge and solidarity between generations\u201d published by the FEMM and the Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL) Committees, her main focus rested on the EU 2020 Strategy and on the fact that the employment rate for women must also increase to create financial growth. Although all European Member States are addressing the issue of reconciliation policies and are looking to emulate the successes of Sweden, Denmark and Finland - where fathers\u2019 participation in parental leave represents 20%, a large disparity stills looms. Research carried out by The Bank of Italy shows that if female employment can rise to, for instance 60 % in a country like Italy, then gross domestic product would also rise 7 %. Taking into account that certain countries\u2019 growth rates amount to a mere 1% - this linkage is worth keeping in mind. Violence against women Another important issue was that of violence against women where Ms. Edit Bauer and Mr. Marc Tarabella, MEP from Belgium, both underlined the necessity for EIGE and the FEMM Committee to heighten their efforts for cooperation. \u201cThe position of the FEMM committee on the importance of violence confirms the significance of gathering the data in this area, which helps to analyse the size and nature of the challenge and we are due to deliver a first smaller study later on this year\u201d, states Virginija Langbakk.

The research indicates that women remain the main carers of children and the elderly, in the majority of the Member States of the European Union. Thus women, more than men, face the difficulty of reconciling the role of the carer with employment. This conflict represents a missed opportunity for the economy as well as for the individual. More women than men reduce the hours that they work in order to provide informal care. One third of women who curtail their employment in order to offer care report the reason to be the lack of care services. According to EIGE\u2019s current research, women of working age spend three times longer than men on childcare per day. Women in full time employment who are also fulfilling a caring role are working significantly more hours than their male counterparts when informal care is taken into consideration, reducing time available for leisure activities. Part-time work has become increasingly common in European Member States, especially amongst women. Part-time work has been considered as a possible way of balancing work and care responsibilities. But, part-time work does not offer the same career progression opportunities as full time work therefore a compromise must still be made between child care and a successful career. Reconciliation Policies Reconciliation policies are designed to minimise conflict between work and family responsibilities and to encourage women\u2019s participation in the labour market without discouraging reproduction. The 1996 EU Directive on Parental Leave is a reconciliation policy that has been established in all European Union Member States. However, the legal framework around this policy differs across Europe, which affects the impact of the policy. For example, where paternity leave is transferable, or poorly paid, the take-up is low. Employers may favour male recruits as they are less likely to incur replacement costs. In Sweden, Denmark and Finland \u2013 where paternity leave is non-transferable, an increase in father\u2019s participation in parenting is reported representing 20% of leave taken for this role. Reconciliation policies and laws can have a positive impact upon the economy and individuals lives if they are developed well, and all European Member States are addressing this issue to some degree, but great disparity remains. Maternity leave is a period of time taken off work by an expectant mother to cover the birth of her child, and this may be with pay. The leave period commences some time before the birth and ends some weeks afterwards, when the mother returns to work. Paternity leave is a paid or unpaid leave of absence from work granted to a father to care for an infant. Parental leave is defined as an individual right to leave for men and women workers on the grounds of the birth or adoption of a child to enable them to take care of that child, for at least three months, until a given age up to eight years, to be determined by Member States and/or the social partners. This leave is separate from maternity leave for mothers and from paternity leave for fathers where it exists. EIGE\u2019s research Research, currently being undertaken by EIGE, looks at work-life balance in Europe. The impact of care responsibilities on men and women\u2019s presence in the labour market is considered, and how legislation and policy developments impact upon this. The particular aim of this research is to assess the availability and reliability of data and to provide alternative methods for measuring these policies in order to effectively evaluate the progress in this policy area. Evaluation is necessary in order to assess the effectiveness of policy developments in achieving the Beijing Platform for Action Indicators in Europe. The Beijing Platform for Action is a document that outlines the international community\u2019s commitment to address 12 areas of critical concern regarding the advancement of women. The European Union has developed a set of indicators in relation to the Beijing areas of concern. The EU has committed to reporting upon progress in relation to these indicators.

International Women's Day provides us all with the opportunity to cast our minds back to former struggles and accomplishments. It creates an arena where measuring the advancement of remaining challenges together with assessing them become a reality. In order to assess the situation a propos equality between women and men in Europe, the European Institute for Gender Equality has examined publicly available data and has formulated 100 areas where inequalities still persist today to illustrate tribute to the past achievements of women; whilst testifying to the ubiquitous gaps. That largely we are still in fact a long way from achieving gender equality. Is it for instance fair that women aged 25 to 44 spend three times longer than men, in childcare (60 minutes per day for women to 22 minutes for men)? Is it justified that only 2% of ministers in Europe are women? Isn't it frightening that statistically, every fourth woman has experienced physical violence at least once during their adult lives? One hundred years ago, the first International Women's Day came into being as an initiative by the governments of Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. Ever since more than one million women and men have attended International Women's Day rallies campaigning for working, ballot, education and decision-making rights as well as rallying for the eventual end of violence against women and discrimination. In 2010 EIGE launched its Women of Europe calendar. Its primary purposes include the inspiration of individual women and society at large, to highlight their achievements regardless of national, ethnic, cultural or economic diversity \u2013 as well as to present positive examples of non-stereotypical roles and success stories of women of Europe. Preparations for its second successive calendar which nominations are mostly welcome for are currently underway. A short timeline This past century has borne witness to many significant achievements where expanding and securing women\u2019s rights are concerned \u2013 all essential landmarks in the improvement of European politics, economies and social structures. Notwithstanding the proposal of English philosopher John Stuart Mill in the late1860s; to replace the term 'man' with 'person' which was greeted with ridicule and mockery in the House of Commons, the British women\u2019s movement and the final campaign which Millicent Fawcett and Emmeline Pankhurst led, forced the bill through which went on to allow women over the age of 30 to vote, in 1918. In a number of Nordic countries, women won the right to vote even earlier: in 1906 in Finland, in 1913 in Norway, and in 1915 in Denmark and Iceland. Yielding to the pressure of society and feminist movements, many European countries reformed marriage acts which granted spouses equal rights, married women legal majority and economic equality and adopted laws on equal salaries for both sexes. Sweden further progressed by allowing women to become priests in 1958 \u2013 a mere 50 years ago! And the United Kingdom had not proclaimed marital rape illegal in England and Wales until 1991. Undeniably, the establishment of the European Union and the claim to equality between women and men as one of its core values has played a major role in the consolidation of Europe. This has in turn contributed to the commitment towards equality between women and men, including the protection of fundamental rights, combating discrimination, strengthening social cohesion and mobilising women\u2019s full potential for economic growth and prosperity across the EU. Starting from the European policies of equal opportunities and equal possibilities for women and men in the area of employment, during late 90s the EU has embarked on numerous political strategies - including strategies for special gender equality measures and gender mainstreaming. The European Commission Strategy for Equality between Women and Men (2010-2015) and its five priority areas (equal economic independence; equal pay for equal work and work of equal value; equality in decision making; dignity, integrity and tackling gender-based violence; and gender equality in external relations) is an excellent example of goals and measures which unite Europe under its core value of equality between women and men. Inspired by greater equality in legislative rights, growing numbers of women in employment or decision making bodies and increased visibility in public life, one could misleadingly find themselves in a position to believe that women have finally accomplished true equality. A recent 2009 Special Eurobarometer report on Gender Equality found that 62% of Europeans believe that gender inequality was widespread, despite the majority of Europeans agreeing that it was less widespread than 10 years previously. With great dismay, women still compose a mere fraction in top business management positions. Among the largest publicly listed companies in the EU Member States, 38% have no women on the boards and only 28% have more than one . In 2010, women accounted for an average of 24% of members of national parliaments in the EU and EU women still earn approximately 17.5% less than their male counterparts. Reliable data and information exhibits concrete facts and makes inequality difficult to ignore and these 100 examples of inequality demonstrate the gaps and challenges that await us. The European Institute for Gender Equality is making extensive efforts in the contribution of making equality between women and men a reality for all and believes that women deserve to live purposeful lives, to be acknowledged and to be respected.", "url": "https://eige.europa.eu/news/eige-marks-100-years-international-womens-day"}, {"id": "EIGE_NEWS_0195", "date": "2011-03-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "100th International Women\u2019s Day - 100 Inequalities remain", "text": "8 March 2011 marks the 100th anniversary of International Women\u2019s Day.EIGE\u2019s list of 100 Inequalitiesillustrate that we are still a long way from achieving gender equality. EIGE\u2019s list of 100 Inequalities \u2013 a mere indication of today's inequalities - demonstrates that despite the achievements of the past 100 years, gender inequality remains an issue. Women are in general not paid equally for the same job as men, women are not equally represented in business and in politics, and women\u2019s health, education, and violence against women, are all burning issues. EIGE\u2019s Director Virginija Langbakk, says: \"Inequality is still obvious in many areas. Women represent an average of 59 percent of university graduates in the EU yet only 3 percent of company presidents are women and only 12 percent of corporate boards. On average, in the EU, women\u2019s unemployment rate remains higher than men\u2019s\". Removing barriers to gender equality, tackling gender-based violence, getting more women into the labour market , company boardrooms and into top level jobs, has a positive impact on the economy and on the development of each woman and man. The Bank of Italy estimates that if female employment rose to 60 percent, gross domestic product would rise 7%. \u201cIn a country where growth is at 1%, that\u2019s something to keep in mind\u201d said Anna Maria Tarantola, the bank\u2019s deputy director general (International Herald Tribune \u2013 Thursday Feb 3). In addition to the list of 100 Inequalities, EIGE is holding an event in Budapest, Hungary (holding the Presidency of the EU Council). The event will bring together stakeholders and media to discuss how to tackle gender inequality issues (view photos from the consultation meeting). On the same day - from its headquarters in Vilnius, Lithuania \u2013 EIGE will host an array of women Ambassadors who will present a number of inequalities which still exist in their countries (view photos from the event). By working together we can ensure that there is a lot to celebrate every International Women\u2019s Day. Download the Press release (.pdf, 61.1KB) 1. In 2009, the rate of employment for women in the EU was 12.1 percentage points lower than the same rate for men in employment [1]. 2. 31% of employed women in the EU only worked part time in comparison to a mere 7.4% of men in 2009 [2]. 3. The rate for women at risk of poverty in 2007 stood at 17% compared to 15% for men. When it came to the elderly, the same rate stood at 22% for women compared to 17% for men (and 34% for single parents) [3]. 4. In 2008, the rate for women\u2019s unemployment was 0.9% greater than men's [3]. 5. The unemployment rate of migrant women (14%) is higher than that of migrant men (11.3 %) [4]. 6. There are consistently fewer employed women with disabilities than employed men with disabilities [5]. 7. With more women working in the public sector, the impact of job losses as a result of the economic crisis and budget cuts is felt more with them than with men [3]. 8. Experiences from past crises show that men's employment generally recovers faster than women\u2019s [6]. 9. The risk of not being re-employed is higher for women [3]. 10. Having children affects the employment rates of women and men differently. Women's participation in the labour market drops by an average of 12% whereas men\u2019s increases by 9.1% [7]. 11. In 2008, women with children under 12 had a significantly lower employment rate than those without, 67% and 78.5% respectively, a negative difference of 11.5 percentage point [3]. 12. In 2008, men with children under 12 had a significantly higher employment rate than those without, 91.6% vs. 84.8%, a positive difference of 6.8 percentage point [3]. 13. Around 30% of working-age women with care responsibilities are either economically inactive or work part-time due to the lack of care services for children and other dependent persons [3]. 14. Gender pay and work gaps in full and part-time employment tend to arise between the ages of 25 and 35, showing the high impact of family responsibilities on female employment [8]. 15. 84% of men who either have one or more children, or their wife/partner is expecting a child - have neither considered nor taken parental leave. Almost all eligible mothers make use of their right to parental leave further aggravating the gap [9]. 16. Employed women spend 39 hours a week on average on home care activities compared to men's 26 hours [10]. 17. Care responsibilities for adult dependent persons in 2005 amounted to almost double in women (12.8 million) than in men (7.6 million) [3]. 18. In 2008, the women's employment between the ages of 55-64 was 18.2 points lower than men's, partly because of their care responsibilities for adult dependent persons [3]. 19. Despite spending fewer hours on average in paid employment, women work more hours than men when combining unpaid work (e.g. household chores, childcare, care of elderly and sick family members, voluntary work) with paid work [11]. 20. Women aged 25 to 44 spend practically three times longer than men do on childcare per day (60 minutes for women to 22 minutes for men) [11]. 21. Women aged 15-24 work an hour longer every day than men when preparing food, washing dishes, and cleaning the house are taken into account [11]. 22. In 2008, women on average were paid 17.5% less than men in the EU [12]. 23. Women are over-represented in health care, education and public administration which are generally sectors receiving lower salaries than typical male professions [13]. 24. Within the same sector or company, the jobs done by women tend to be valued and paid less for [13]. 25. Female entrepreneurs account for only 33.2 per cent of self-employed women [14]. 26. More men than women openly state that they prefer self\u2013employment: around 50% of men state this, compared to around 40% of women [15]. 27. Women account for only 36 % of graduates in science, maths, informatics and engineering [8]. 28. The proportion of female students (55%) and graduates (59%) exceeds that of male students, but is lower among PhD students (48%) and PhD graduates (45%) [8]. 29. The fields of science, mathematics and computing and particularly engineering, manufacturing and construction is characterised by higher numbers of male PhD holders with women representing less than 25% [8]. 30. Only 19 % of grade A[16] academic professors in public universities are women [8]. 31. The proportion of women among full professors is highest in humanities and in the social sciences (27% and 18.6%) and lowest in engineering and technology (7.2%) [8]. 32. Women represent 39% of researchers in the government sector, 37% of all researchers in higher education and a mere 19% in the business sector [8]. 33. Female researchers feature in higher proportions in social sciences, agricultural sciences, medical sciences, and humanities than in engineering and technology, a key research area [8]. 34. On average 32% of scientists and engineers are women in the EU-27 [8]. 35. Women account for 59% of university graduates, whereas men account for 82% of full professors [8]. 36. Only 13% of institutions in higher education are headed by women and just 9% of universities are led by a woman [8]. 37. On average in the EU-27, only 22% of board members of universities and research institutes are women [8]. 38. In 2004, in primary and secondary schools, over 68% of teachers were women. In contrast to this, in universities and in other tertiary-level education, women only made-up less than 40% of teachers [17]. 39. Of a total of 543 Nobel prizes and prizes in Economic Sciences awarded since 1901, only 41 have been awarded to women [8]. 40. On average women have lower pension incomes in the EU [18]. 41. In 2008, the risk of poverty among elderly women stood at 22% compared to 16% for elderly men [18]. 42. In 2008, 35% of single parents (mostly single mothers) were exposed to a high poverty risk [18]. 43. Women with disabilities and from minority ethnic groups experience higher poverty risks than men, have worse access to employment, education, health and social services [19]. 44. In the majority of EU countries, migrant women in employment lag behind non-migrant women by as much as 30% [20]. 45.

Gender-based violence is fundamentally rooted in gender inequality and impacts on the future of women and of men in Europe. The problem of violence against women within the European Union can be more effectively addressed through collaborative efforts that seek to highlight and combat the issue through the lens of human rights and gender equality. Given the continued absence of comparable EU-wide data on violence against women, it is clear that there is a pressing need for the collection of evidence about the extent and nature of the problem, and its impact on women\u2019s physical and psychological well-being across different areas of everyday life \u2013 ranging from employment through to housing and healthcare. Robust data is essential to inform policy development and action on the ground to more effectively address gender-based violence within a framework for promoting gender equality. The collection of comparable and reliable data is one of the main gaps and challenges in the area of combating violence against women. Therefore the development of the Resource and Documentation Centre at EIGE is expected to strengthen the work with gender equality. In recognition of the continued lack of comprehensive and comparable data on the scale and nature of violence against women across the EU, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, in cooperation with the European Institute for Gender Equality, is embarking on survey research to collect data on violence against women. The FRA will utilise its experience of having conducted large-scale surveys, together with its in-house expertise in the field of violence against women and in consultation with a range of experts including the EIGE, in the development of a survey instrument on violence against women. After a preparatory test-phase in 2011, the FRA will launch the survey to explore women\u2019s experiences of physical, sexual and psychological violence during their lifetime. The cooperation arrangement between EIGE and FRA will make it possible to pool resources and share valuable expertise and data in the pursuit of this goal. At a meeting held at the FRA on 12th November, with, amongst others, representatives from the EIGE and the European Parliament, the FRA set out to examine the policy and practical uses to which the survey results can potentially be put. The results of this meeting, together with other meetings held with a range of experts in connection with the survey, should ensure that the findings can be of use to a range of different stakeholders in the EU who are working to address this fundamental rights abuse.

EIGE's Director Virginija Langbakk and FRA Director Morten Kjaerum signing the cooperation agreement The two EU agencies will initiate cooperation in gender mainstreaming and researching in the field of gender equality. One of the main areas of cooperation will be on working to end violence against women in the EU. The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) will survey more than 27,000 women in order to collect data on the extent of violence against women in the EU. Given the current lack of comparable data showing the scale and nature of this crime across the EU, there is a real knowledge gap in this area. A range of experts from the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE), together with specialists from other institutions, will help ensure that the FRA findings will be widely available to the different stakeholders working to strengthen the fundamental rights.

The Strategy defines some concrete tasks for the Institute and we are in the process of delivering a range of tools in support of this\u201d. \u201cThis policy document recently renewed European Commission\u2019s commitment to promoting gender equality. The strategy spells out five priorities: the economy and labour market, equal pay, equality in senior positions, tackling gender violence, and promoting equality beyond the EU. It aims in particular to make better use of women's potential, thereby contributing to the EU's overall economic and social goals\u201d, says Virginija Langbakk. In compliance with the strategy EIGE will assist the European Commission and the Member States by carrying out a number of important tasks including support for the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action that also includes the development and updating of indicators. EIGE will also collect and analyze comparable data on gender issues, and will develop methodological tools, in particular for the integration of the gender dimension in all policy areas. An other important task for the institute is to set up a documentation centre accessible to the public with existing statistics, data and information, functioning models and approaches to gender mainstreaming employed by various EU bodies, Member States etc. To contribute effectively with the information, EIGE is on the way to establish a virtual European Network on Gender Equality. Various EIGE studies on gender equality will ultimately form the basis for the creation of an EU Gender Index. The Index will provide Member States and the EU Institutions with the tools to measure progress in gender equality - further strengthening the Commission's new strategy. EIGE and other EU agencies will create such tools in cooperation and synergy with Eurostat, another active player at EIGE\u2019s event in Vilnius. The Vilnius seminar also resulted in new cooperation among European agencies, crucial to the implementation of the new strategy. EIGE signed cooperation agreements with the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (EUROFOUND) and theEU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA). During the seminar, the Institute\u2019s official logo was unveiled, created by logo competition winner \u2013 French primary school teacher Mr. Guillaume Danjou. He and Polish runner-up Ms. Zofia Szostkiewicz were handed their awards in person by Vice-President Reding. The competition attracted artists and designers from all over Europe and received more than 1600 proposals from every EU country. According to the competition jury, the logo created by Mr.Danjou not only inspires, but also best reflects EIGE\u2019s objectives of pushing existing boundaries in gender equality, whilst communicating messages of profound importance to the European Union.

The seminar will provide a platform for discussion on the implementation of the new EU gender equality strategy and lay the groundwork for the significant steps to be taken by the Institute over the coming years. EIGE will also sign important cooperation agreements defining synergies in work with other EU agencies. Finally, the Institute will also unveil its official logo during the seminar.

EIGE encourages nominations from and about the successful 'Women of Europe'. The activity aims to highlight their achievements and success stories - as part of its efforts to disseminate information regarding positive examples of non-stereotypical roles and to publicise such success stories. EIGE Director Virginija Langbakk, commented: \"The achievements and contributions of women to the development of society today receives less recognition and visibility. The objective of this activity is to promote the success of women and their achievements\" The database will contain information about women from all over Europe who could act as a role-model and as a source of inspiration for others. The database will be used by EIGE and its stakeholders in search of realistic evidence of success in the form of testimonials, expert or speaker interventions. Over time as the activity gains momentum, the 'Women of Europe' database will become an integral part of the Institute's resource centre pooling experience and bringing recognition to their achievements. A Woman can either participate or can be nominated based on the following: - Evidence of breaking gender stereotypes \u2013 i.e. behaving differently, acting and thinking \"outside the (gender) box\"; - Evidence of achieving recognition and visibility for her actions; - Evidence of supporting women (promoting, encouraging). As a part of this project EIGE plans to publish a 2011 calendar: \"Women Inspiring Europe\". This calendar will bring to the forefront the various life stories of 12 women, their achievements and successes. Throughout 2010, the 12 women will be selected among the nominees of the 'Women of Europe' database. Candidates for the calendar should be received by July 31st, 2010.

This is a tremendous concern and challenge, particularly for women, as most women are employed in the public sector and benefit from social services such as child and elderly care\".
