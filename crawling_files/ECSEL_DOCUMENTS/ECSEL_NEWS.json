The project consortium comprises the main European players in a complete value chain that extends from the BICMOS semiconductor technologies development, to the integrated circuits designs that enable system demonstrators to reach unsurpassed performance. The partners are research centres, universities, laboratories, and industrial leaders and users, thus combining the highest scientific excellence and the ability to validate the work carried out on appropriate demonstrators to be successful on the targeted markets. The main objectives of TARANTO are to develop HBT (Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors) devices with high maximum frequency (Fmax: 600GHz) built into high-density CMOS processes, like 90nm for Infineon and 55nm for STMicroelectronics, and even higher maximum frequency at 700GHz in IHP pilot line with a technology that remains compatible with industrial constraints. While IHP has reached this breakthrough of 700GHz, Infineon reached 495GHz, which are now the new state of the Art worldwide for pilot line and industrial BICMOS technologies. STMicroelectronics has simulated 580GHz with its new BICMOS technology. STMicroelectronics and Infineon are now on the way to reach the 600GHz targeted in TARANTO. These BICMOS technologies have been used within TARANTO to reach outstanding results for optical and 5G wireless telecommunication systems, and for innovative radar systems concepts. In telecommunications, they enabled the best world performance to date for optical telecommunication with a 1.52 TB/s over 80km of optical fibre link, achieved by Nokia and Micram. More efficient 5G wireless systems have been demonstrated like an E-Band backhaul transceiver, a wireless repeater with beam forming for final link to homes, and a 6G transceiver with beam forming for mobile users. Thus TARANTO enables the complete telecommunication link from the cloud to the users, meeting the needs of more efficiency in energy use and faster telecommunications required by volumes of data that shall be transferred and to the ubiquitous use of smart sensors in industry, cities and automated vehicles. Worth to note also is that the wireless beamforming systems enable the use of more directional beams, reducing unwanted interference and wasted radio energy and thus enable a healthier environment. These smart sensors can be equipped with the radar systems that have been developed in TARANTO, which frequencies range from 79 to 240GHz with mm positioning accuracy, low consumption, low cost, weather immune, and capable of relative speed determination of moving objects. They can equip any system that needs for smart mobility, like ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) and autonomous transportation, but also moving robots in storage facilities or even in assembly lines, and else any systems that need for objects determination like persons monitoring in public spaces, indoors, or liquid levels monitoring for industrial, or vital constant surveillance in health environments. These impressive achievements have drawn great international attention and have been globally recognized as breakthrough, propelling Europe into pole position with these crucial BICMOS technologies.

The company\u00a0has been founded in 2017 by neuromodulation industry members that previously founded and ran Sapiens Steering Brain Stimulation B.V. with the ambition to develop a bioelectronics therapy for people suffering from\u00a0neurological disease, that is as easy as taking medication, yet side-effect free.\u00a0 Most people who are prone to headaches, get painful attacks once or twice a month. But if a person suffers from a chronic migraine, they experience extraordinary headaches more than half of the\u00a0month. These severe and frequent attacks can make living a normal life a real challenge. The condition is estimated to affect one out of seven people,\u00a0mostly\u00a0women, and is considered to be the prime cause of disability in people under 50-years-old. Up until now, both migraine and chronic migraines could\u00a0be treated with drugs. These include medications that treat the pain and symptoms, like severe pain throbbing, vomiting or nausea,\u00a0as well as drugs that treat the underlying cause of migraine. In some cases, there are medical devices you can use to interrupt the headache. Still, no treatment known until now was\u00a0fully effective, taking a toll on many people's quality of\u00a0life.\u00a0 Salvia Bioelectronics is developing new\u00a0solution for treating migraines, which will be extremely unobtrusive and as easy as taking drugs, yet much more effective - the company is working on creating an implantable treatment, in the form of an\u00a0ultra thin bioelectronic foil.

As a result, over 450 European stakeholders, decision makers,\u00a0 industry, \u00a0research and banking group representatives gathered virtually in the morning of 24th June 2020 at the fourth edition of the ECSEL JU Symposium, for the first time taking place entirely online, after three successful events held in Malta, Brussels, and Bucharest. \u00a0\u00a0 Under the title \u201cKey Digital Technologies enabling European economic recovery\u201d, the event was moderated entirely by the ECSEL JU\u2019s Executive Director Bert de Colvenaer. The two-session event started with an inspiring speech by European Commissioner Thierry Breton, who made a strong statement about Europe\u2019s potential to become an autonomous global player in strategic sectors, such as Artificial Intelligence or high-performance computing. However, stressed Mr Breton, to achieve digital autonomy, Europe needs to invest in the ability to manufacture our own electronic strategic components. \u201cFor the first time in a long time we see companies investing\u00a0billions\u00a0of euros in development of production capacity in Europe,\u00a0based on technologies\u00a0brought\u00a0to maturity thanks to ECSEL JU.\u201d, said Commissioner Breton. Mr Breton\u2019s opening words were followed by a keynote speech by Ms Maria da Gra\u00e7a Carvalho, Member of European Parliament, who addressed the issues of digital transformation and Europe\u2019s digital sovereignty. Ms Carvalho tackled the extreme importance of establishing ethical and values boundaries in the process of digital transformation, which might be considered less important by some of the world leaders. \u201cWe need to make sure promising technologies, such as AI, Internet of Things, blockchain, and others, serve the best to the interest of our people.\u201d, said MEP Carvalho. Addressing the current reality and world\u2019s historic deployment of remote work and digital access to services, she \u00a0stressed the need to achieve the Europe\u2019s goal to become digitally autonomous: \u201cWe need to achieve digital sovereignty without giving up on our principles.\u201d The first session of the Symposium focused on the new post-COVID-19 challenges for Europe and its ECS industry, including the European Green Deal. This session brought together representatives from the major European industrial leaders, who discussed the state-of-play digital technologies in the continent, the new opportunities for the ECS industry, and the most strategic future investments for the sector. The speakers\u2019 panel, featuring Jens Fabrowsky from Robert Bosch, Milan Petkovic from Philips Healthcare, Bj\u00f6rn Ekelund from Ericsson and Stephan Neugebauer, BMW Group, tackled many other relevant topics, such as current threats to Europe\u2019s digital sovereignty, and the optimal ways to ensure balanced strategy and a properly dimensioned budget for a quick European socio-economic recovery; they were also glad and willing \u00a0to answer questions coming from the online audience. The second session of the online Symposium was centred around re-building and strengthening European Digital Competences, and the need for a European partnership on Key Digital Technologies. The speakers were invited to share their view on how industrial policy can effectively support the European ECS value/supply chains, and what policies are needed to secure long-term investments across the continent. The prominent speakers\u2019 panel included Victor Negrescu, Member of the European Parliament; Julie Galland from Ministry of Economy and Finance in France; Lucilla Sioli from the European Commission; Ina Schieferdecker from Federal Ministry of Education and Research; and Stefano Firpo from Intesa Sanpaolo. The speakers presented their views on key subject, including how to mobilise the financial resources supporting National and European policy measures post COVID-19. The event was concluded by a remarkable speech by Mariya Gabriel, European Commissioner for Research & Innovation. \u201cOur global success will depend on the capacity to lead the development of very advanced components and make them future proof\u201d- said the Commissioner, in the context of Europe becoming the first green continent. She stressed: \u201cOur scientists and engineers have to embed the requirement of energy efficiency in their research and development work by design.\u201d The Commissioner had also expressed her very convincing support to public private partnerships: \u201cTo be able to play in the global scene, Europe needs ambition, knowledge and critical mass, and the ECSEL Joint Undertaking has been an important vehicle to align the research and innovation agendas of the European Union Member States and Industry\u201d, said Mrs Gabriel. As a result of such statements, the community has been reassured about a strong support from EU policy makers and even more committed to make the next JU as the leading European strategic initiative for focused, coordinated and competitive research and innovation activities in the ECS field. The important closing speech, and a resounding Call to Action, was given by a well-known figure in ECSEL JU community, Ms Sabine Herlitschka, the Chair of the ECSEL JU Governing Board, as well as a CEO and a CTO of Infineon Technologies Austria. \u201cDigital technologies are a new currency, a geopolitical strategic factor\u201d - said Ms Herlitschka \u2013 \u201cthe COVID-19 crisis was a wake-up call, which helped us see how important they are. We all need a sense of urgency \u2013 now is the time to be bold.\u201d Given the magnitude of the effort required, only a risk sharing approach, like a PPP, is the way forward. A significant joint public-private investment is needed to accelerate economic recovery and sustainability while securing prioritization, synergies and alignment of policies and strategies at European, National and Regional level. A joint undertaking on KDT offers the instrument for securing global leadership, technology independence and digital sovereignty across many fields (including health), enabling creation of growth, jobs and additional economic opportunities at all levels within the EU.

These are the most fundamental capabilities upon which virtually all other domains rely. Access to these technologies must be guaranteed, to secure any of Europe\u2019s societal goals. As emphasised by Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Com- mission, in her 2020 \u201cState of the EU\u201d speech, ECS underpin all digital technologies, and impact everything from healthcare to clean energy and transport, food safety, broadband communications and competitive industries\u00a0offering meaningful jobs for all. The importance of assured access to ECS is therefore paramount for Europe. ECSEL JU raised this topic at its Symposium of 2019 in Bucharest, which was further iterated on by Commissioner Thierry Breton in the Symposium of 2020 (https://www.ecsel.eu/ecsel- ju-symposium-2020-brussels) and many other public statements. Quick and direct access to key products and technologies \u2013 although the diversity of concerns it brings, in a fully interconnected world \u2013 is a topic of very high political visibility, now even more emphasised by the consequences of the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic. The ECSEL JU unique funding model, based on open collaboration, has demonstrated its capability to achieve concrete results, while coping with concerns of stakeholders and respecting their diversity of standpoints. This has already resulted in multi-billion investments in new manufacturing capacity in Europe (see the reports on ECSEL JU impacts at\u00a0https://www.ecsel.eu/publications). Bert De Colvenaer, the Executive Director of ECSEL JU, has stressed several times the need to develop an ambitious European industrial plan for ECS, where RD&I is key for assuring the technology autonomy of the EU. We live in a world-wide market evolving at the highest speed: new needs, new expectations, new priorities are in front of us. So, we are asked to provide answers to match that speed. Innovative working models based on collaboration and knowledge sharing are\u00a0needed, and ECSEL JU offers a clear example\u00a0of \u2018\u2018thinking together, working together and investing together\u2019\u2019, how a joint program may bring excellent results in a very competitive\u00a0market like ECS. Digital technologies are key for our society and for the EU\u2019s economic recovery and, also, stability. The goal should be to make Europe the most attractive place to develop and deploy new ECS technologies. Stable legal frameworks, industrial strategies, and political willingness as well as favourable economic conditions are crucial to make companies stay\u00a0and invest in the EU. To quote the EU Council President Charles Michel: \u2018\u2018Production of [computer] processors, vital medicines, and other essential products ought to be brought back to Europe from overseas. The strategic independence of Europe is our new common project for this. The ECS sector is growing at the highest speed, driven inter alia by electrification and automation of vehicles, digitalisation of industry and agriculture, of electrical power grids (renewables) and even cities. Guided by well-established European values, they form the hub for solutions to societal challenges, including the \u201cEuropean Green Deal\u201d. Many of Europe\u2019s strengths are based on the deep technical knowledge and leading market position in this sector. These growing markets provide clear opportunities for ECS, but the speed of innovation and its uptake by markets are becoming increasingly important. Value chains are becoming complex networks: shorter and more interconnected. Cyber-\u00a0security has become a challenging, high-profile\u00a0issue. Systems companies need a stable supply of affordable, energy efficient and trusted components well-matched to the needs of their customers. While the steady miniaturisation of semiconductor transistor technology will remain relevant, new paradigms beyond scaling are emerging, and newly emerging computing architectures beyond the traditional ones will need to be brought to market quickly.\u00a0There is not time to waste! In the field of ECS, the ECSEL JU program\u00a0already serves as an essential catalyst for additional investments: EC contribution complemented by national and even regional financial support. With its tripartite model (EU/Participating States/industry), the ECSEL JU facilitates the creation of an ecosystem across Europe, unique and unmatched by any other program in this sector. Future policies can (and should) build further on this model\u2019s\u00a0successes. The need for a European partnership on Key Digital Technologies appears now strategic to re-build and strengthen the\u00a0European Digital Competences. The EU has\u00a0the political power and the technology competence to modify the current dynamics and put in place an industrial policy, in particular in ECS and digital domain, favourable for long- term investments, and so to create stability and technology autonomy, facing up to the massive investments heavily supported by\u00a0governments in other geographies. Observing the concerns of the stakeholders\u00a0in ECSEL JU, we see the need to find the proper\u00a0compromise between \u2018\u2018open market\u2019\u2019 and the need to secure \u2018\u2018technology independence (i.e. securing the supply/value chains)\u2019\u2019. It is crucial to establish strategic global alliances for\u00a0economic and technological issue as well as to identify the today\u2019s threats to preserve our own European values. There are sectors, as ECS, where a risk sharing approach is a must, given the magnitude of the effort required. In that light, we certainly see that public- private investments are the way forward. Only in a context of open collaboration can synergies and alignment of policies and strategies be reached. It is crucial to maintain EU strengths (including manufacturing capabilities) and secure fast access to reliable solutions, wherever possible \u201cmade in Europe\u201d. We see for the first time, major investments in chip production capacity in Europe thanks to\u00a0projects funded through ECSEL JU. However, full access to the best knowledge and networks, based upon reciprocity, is the key for securing autonomy without entering\u00a0in a protectionism mode. Lately, the concept of \u201ctech-sovereignty/ autonomy\u201d has become a viral phenomenon, due to the COVID-19 crisis. The idea of reducing Europe\u2019s dependence on US or Chinese-origin technologies is more and more popular. \u201cIf we don\u2019t build our own champions in all areas \u2014\u00a0digital, artificial intelligence,\u201d French President\u00a0Emmanuel Macron recently said, \u201cour choices\u00a0will be dictated by others\u201d. In this respect, it is also important to mention a very recent statement from the European Court of Auditors. According to a new\u00a0ECA\u2019s\u00a0analysis published on 10 September 2020\u00a0https://www.eca.europa.eu/en/Pages/ DocItem.aspx?did=54733, the EU should respond more decisively to the industrial and investment strategies from other geographies. In such analysis, the ECA examines the multiple risks, mainly of an economic and\u00a0political nature, that the strategy of China\u2019s state-led investment brings to the EU as well as the opportunities it offers. Competing on an equal footing for EU companies operating abroad is essential. Non-discriminatory treatment, transparency, predictability, and legal certainty of the investment environment as well as adequate commitments regarding labour and the environment are equally extremely important. If the discussion on the need to achieve \u201ctech-sovereignty\u201d is so strategic, then tools to help building strong networks of com- panies and researchers to lead in break-\u00a0through technologies are crucial. One way to achieve this goal is strengthening European PPPs where public and private members (including private investors) can work together around an agreed program to share risks. But ECSEL JU is all that! It has reached great achievements and should be continued with an even more ambitious budget, to reach those major investments needed to keep European sup- pliers ahead of the world in safety-critical electronics, and put European companies ahead in supplying advanced chips used in many domains, such as the mobile telecom industry, including multi-band, 5G radio and\u00a0beyond. Ultimately, the question leads to the level of EU and national politics and industrial policy, in coordination between individual planning and dynamics and objectives of a general nature. ECSEL JU has been built to serve the general interest of the European citizens. We look forward to securing an even stronger contribution under the new KDT Joint Undertaking. \u00a0 By\u00a0Luciano Gaudio, Deputy Head of Unit for Communications ECSEL Joint Undertaking ", "url": "https://www.ecsel.eu/news/ecsel-ju-securing-europes-future-through-impactful-rdi-electronics"}, {"id": "ECSEL_NEWS_0035", "date": "2020-06-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ECSEL JU - IMI Joint Activity Call Information Session announcement", "text": " ECSEL JU will organize an on-line information session about the ECSEL-2020-3-RIA-IMI-ECSEL-joint-activity Call, related to the cooperation with the IMI JU on next generation of digital technologies for decentralized remote clinical trials.\u00a0 The session will take place on 18th June from 10:00 until roughly 12:00 via an on-line conferencing connection.\u00a0 The event is free of charge but registration is required via the event\u2019s web page.

And yes, a lot of ECSEL JU projects do work in this domain of nanometre semiconductors with equally microscopic voltages and currents. But to be truly useful, in things like managing our energy use and environmental footprint, intelligent mobility and the like (\u201csmart\u201d is so 2020, don\u2019t you think?), you also need electronics that can work in the rough-and-tumble \u201creal world\u201d. That can be a nasty place for a hard-working silicon chip, where voltages and currents are measured in hundreds (not hundredths), and resistance is not only futile, it is highly undesirable (it leads to a lot of wasted energy \u2013 not good). It takes a special kind of technology to stand up under those conditions, and the ECSEL JU project POWERBASE has made big strides in developing just that. The project has also cleared the path for another ECSEL JU funded collaboration, \u201cUltimateGAN\u201d, which further develops on the POWERBASE results. Power electronics as such is not new. It is so essential, it\u2019s basically always been there, with each new development letting it do its job better and more efficiently. Same with POWERBASE, which uses Gallium Nitride (GaN) as an alternative to silicon-based devices to eek even more efficiency out of the chips and systems that use it. As an example, one of the demonstrators developed by partners in the consortium improves the efficiency of a power converter, used in telecommunications systems, servers and the like, by 2%. That may not sound like much, but it represents a 40% reduction in the energy wasted in such converters. Multiply that up by the huge number of such servers and data equipment in the world, and you have a significant beneficial impact on the energy used.

ECSEL JU was particularly proud and thankful that Presidency officials offered the use of the historic and spectacular Palace of Parliament in Bucharest to hold the event! As ever, it is clear from the programme that the annual Symposium event is designed to go beyond a discussion about technical aspects of the ECSEL JU programme. The panel sessions not only demonstrate the political and societal importance of the ECSEL JU programme, they also seek to maintain and advance the added value of the ECSEL JU as an effective European collaborative RD&I instrument, for the benefit of European citizens and businesses. The combination on the one hand of tackling less obvious issues, such as technology sovereignty, presenting alternative views of the future (like it or not, agree with it or not \u2013 such presentations are ever thought-provoking), and on the other, giving a platform to ECSEL JU projects and Lighthouse Initiatives to show off their progress (in a completely revamped exhibition format, too) made for a particularly strong message: instruments like ECSEL JU must be an essential element in any future programme that has the ambition and scale to elicit positive change and growth through investing in scientific and technological progress. Striking was the presentation by Romano Hoofman from imec (a leading European research and technology organisation), who stressed that prioritizing research & innovation (R&I) is needed to overcome this challenge: \u00a0the widening digital skills gap. The European Commission even predicts 756.000 unfilled jobs in the European ICT sector by 2020, slowing down the Digital Transformation of Europe.\u00a0 The crucial role of speed and a guided sense of urgency in R&I activities was also a common point that came out from the panel discussions. While it is essential to agree on a common strategic research agenda (as has already largely been achieved), it is of paramount importance to speed up its implementation. Funding entities across Europe need to keep collaborating to set priorities and make sure new ideas are well balanced and executed, recognising the context in a globally competitive and rapidly evolving domain.\u00a0 An answer was given through the presentation by Lars Leger, Chief Technology Officer at NXP, who recognised that \u201cECSEL JU keeps EU Electronic Eco-systems at the Forefront of Technology\u201d, based on achievements such as a solid and long term SRA, creating a unified vision and good alignment via the lighthouse initiatives, and having a mid/long-term vision, providing the momentum in Europe to engage in large-scale projects that thrive on diverse partnerships with a mixture of large / medium / small enterprises and excellent RTOs. The elements are there \u2013 we now need to capitalise on them and move forward briskly.\u00a0 Bert De Colvenaer, Executive Director of ECSEL JU expressed great satisfaction with the event\u2019s outcomes, which have confirmed the ECSEL JU\u2019s role as the \u201cleading European strategic initiative for focused, coordinated and competitive R&I activities in Key Digital Technologies, and the ECSEL JU Symposium as an important showcase for the important work ongoing\u201d. In addition to the formal presentations, and as witnessed by several important parallel meetings organise by and for high-level representatives of Industry and the institutions, the event\u2019s ample networking opportunities provided space and excellent opportunity to involve the ECS community as well as the EU policy makers and other potential stakeholders in developing a common view towards the Horizon Europe programme, at an important juncture in the decision making processes.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Presentations Some of the presenters kindly gave permission to have their presentations placed here.

Ehler, MEP (DE) -EPP Group", "text": " On 16 May 2018, Dr. Ehler, MEP - EPP Group, hosted a working lunch at the European Parliament with a focus on \u00a0the road to Horizon Europe after H2020. The event gathered representatives from the European Commission, represented by Mrs. Lucilla Sioli, European Commission DG CNECT, Jan van den Biesen, representing the three Industry Associations (ARTEMIS-IA, AENEAS and EPoSS) and Ben Ruck, Chair of the Public Authorities Board. The Industry was also represented by Jos Benschop from ASML (The Netherlands) and Ina Sebastian of Infineon (Austria). The ECSEL JU representation consisted of Dr. Sabine Herlitschka, Chair of the ECSEL JU Governing Board and Bert De Colvenaer, Executive Director of the Joint Undertaking. Dr. Ehler opened the working lunch explaining that we face important financial gaps in R&I at national state level; this gap can be bridged by EU mission-oriented programmes. The ECSEL JU is a clear example of existing (and successful) mission-oriented research. Furthermore, he stressed that SMEs are substantial drivers of innovation in the EU. Founded on the successes of ECSEL JU, the three Industry Associations are of the opinion that Horizon Europe, including ECSEL2, should continue to provide public funding to large firms, as these will play a pivotal role in creating and maintaining innovation ecosystems, public-private partnerships and global value chains, from which also many smaller firms, and Society more generally, will benefit. ECS are everywhere and will have a tremendous impact in the future GDP of the EU. It is crucial to pass on this message to policymakers. It is a matter of our future, and how we want to shape it \u00a0together, and is not just \u201canother request for money\u201d. To conclude, Dr. Ehler emphasised the importance of using accessible language, to guide policymakers at all levels in understanding the crucial nature of ECS and showing how the related industries have a positive impact on Europe across different levels. We need to translate the stated ambitions of the sector into clear visualisation of the needs and concrete budget figures. A conversation with Member States on this needs to start now. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.ecsel.eu/news/16-may-2018-working-lunch-european-parliament-hosted-dr-c-ehler-mep-de-epp-group"}, {"id": "ECSEL_NEWS_0095", "date": "2018-11-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Vacancy notice for a traineeship programme within ECSEL JU", "text": " ECSEL Joint Undertaking is looking for a trainee to join the team.

This key ECSEL JU event focused on Europe\u2019s digital future and the electronic components and systems industry under the new \u201cHorizon Europe\u201d RD&I\u00a0Framework Programme. The central theme of the first day was the digital transformation in Europe - what will happen when the exciting new technologies go mainstream, changing the world in the process. The day started with a session led by Alessandro Curioni,\u00a0Vice President of IBM Europe and\u00a0Director of IBM Research Zurich. Mr Curioni spoke about the quantum computing paradigm shift, and its potential to transform and complement other emerging technologies, such as drugs design, machine learning, big data, or cryptography and security. This theme was followed by other brilliant speeches, featuring Luuk Borg from the Commission\u2019s DG CNECT, Alberto Casorati from European Investment Bank, and Francois Gilles of Deloitte Luxembourg. The highlight of the day was a keynote speech by the EU Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society Mariya Gabriel. \u201cCurrently, we don't have computing power in Europe that would match our potential. I am personally dedicated to change that. Mastering digital technologies is essential for Europe, and ECSEL JU is a key tool to reach that goal\u201d,\u00a0said the Commissioner in her speech, demonstrating her support to JU\u2019s current and future activities. The second half of the day was centred around the new horizons for the ECSEL JU programme, and its potential in fostering technology innovation within four topics: Artificial Intelligence, e-Agri, e-Logistics and\u00a0Robotics. \u201cEuropean-level initiatives are the way to go, if we want to compete on the global scale\u201d,\u00a0emphasised all speakers. The second day, themed \u201cECSEL JU towards Horizon Europe\u201d, cast light on exciting, real-life examples of how the ECSEL JU funded projects improve the quality of daily life of European citizens and boost business in Europe. A guest of honour, Roberto Viola - Director General of DG CNECT, spoke about the underlying value of microelectronics: \u201cSmart factories, IoT devices or self-driving cars would not function without microelectronics. Progress and innovation in this field will decide whether digital transformation in Europe will be successful\u201d. Mr Viola expressed his belief in a central role played by the ECSEL JU in the ongoing digital revolution in Europe. The following sessions introduced exciting success stories by industry representatives from a number of European countries such as Italy, Poland, Spain and more, giving a complete picture of the significance the JU\u2019s funding plays in these developments. ECSEL JU was honoured to welcome a wide range of high level speakers, who joined the afternoon session and discussed the upcoming challenges the JU may face during the Horizon Europe programme, as well as potential future research opportunities. The discussion panel consisted of three Members of the European Parliament,\u00a0Paul Rubig, Lieve Wierinck\u00a0and Marian-Jean Marinescu, as well as Colette Maloney from the European Commission, Jean-Luc di Paola-Galloni of the Valeo Group, Maarten Sileghem from the Agency for Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Belgium and Sabine Herlitschka, representing the ECSEL JU Governing Board. The format of the sessions gave the audience a platform to gain an overview of how the ECSEL JU funded projects have had a fundamental impact on the ECS sector and the future challenges which await. The setting also provided an opportunity for participants to engage with speakers through Q&A sessions and to view the full spectrum of ECSEL JU funded projects in a specially designed exhibition space, and an exhibition guided tour, which concluded the second day of the event. The SCOTT project, led by Michael Karner from Virtual Vehicle, received recognition as the best project presented at the event. Outside of the speaking sessions and project exhibition, the Symposium gave an opportunity for stakeholders to network in a vibrant setting, during networking lunches and two social events.

Mr Ansip emphasised also the need of acting and investing together: \u201cThere are many areas, such as cybersecurity or high performance computing, where no Member State can act alone. We have to keep the value chain in Europe and to achieve this, there is a need to create and maintain a truthful legal framework, which will help Europe re-gain its leading position in digital world\u201d. However, the need of larger investments has to be properly communicated. We have to promote better the existing EU funded projects and their results by using a language of ordinary people: \u201cOur citizens need to understand the added value of European investment\u201d, concluded the Commissioner.

Dr Herlitschka, presently Chief Executive Officer of Infineon Technologies Austria AG, succeeds Andrea Cuomo (STMicroelectronics), whose mandate now expires. Dr. Herlitschka combines a broad spectrum of expertise in industry, university management and funding agencies. Before joining Infineon Technologies Austria, she was Director of European and International Programmes in the Austrian Research Promotion Agency. For more than 20 years she has been involved in strategic international and European research, technology and innovation activities, particularly with the U.S. Since the 4th EU Framework Programme she has been involved in European Research & Innovation Programmes as Coordinating National Contact Point, project coordinator & proposal evaluator, as well as member of influential European & international expert groups. Currently, she is member of the Horizon 2020 High Level Strategy Group on Industrial Technologies that is tasked to provide strategic input for the future development of the 9th EU Framework Programme with respect to Industrial and Key Enabling Technologies. ECSEL JU operates an ambitious Research, Development and Innovation programme that will combine EU funding (from Horizon 2020) together with National funds from ECSEL Participating States and the Private sector, to leverage a total investment approaching 5Bn EUR over its lifetime: Electronic Components and Systems (ECS), being at the core of virtually all economic sectors, have unparalleled impact for the economy and for society and in Europe, and are therefore a Key Enabling Technology of considerable significance for Europe. In a joint statement from the three Industry Associations, AENEAS, ARTEMIS-IA and EPoSS, who are members of the ECSEL Public-Private Partnership, they declare \u201cECSEL\u2019s private members are very happy that Sabine Herlitschka has accepted to be nominated, and are delighted that the Governing Board has today elected her as its Chair. We look forward to benefiting from her experience and guidance as ECSEL JU continues to move onwards and upwards.\u201d Khalil Rouhana, Deputy Director-General of DG CONNECT at the European Commission, declared:\u00a0\"We are pleased that the three Industry Associations have agreed to propose Dr. Herlitschka as a candidate, given that she has all the experience and track record needed to perform this task. We would also like to thank Mr. Cuomo for all the work done during his Chairmanship and for his commitment to ECSEL.\". Ben Ruck, Chairperson of the ECSEL Public Authorities\u2019 Board (PAB), looks forward to working closely together with Sabine Herlitschka. \u201cThe Chairperson of the Governing Board can provide important guidance to the direction of the ECSEL programme. I will be very interested in exchanging new ideas and views with Sabine, in order to strengthen the impact of ECSEL.\u201d ECSEL JU\u2019s Executive Director, Bert De Colvenaer, added: \u201cI think I can speak on behalf of all of our stakeholders when I say that we all very much welcome the election of Dr. Herlitschka. Like her predecessor, Andrea Cuomo, she brings a broad base of experience that will certainly consolidate and expand our community, at all levels of the ECS technology supply chain. Joint Undertakings thrive because \u2013 like their name says \u2013 we do things together. Expanding our community while at the same time ensuring unity around a common vision is vital, and the experience of our new Chair reaffirms this ideal. We also wish to thank Andrea Cuomo for the effort and dedication he has shown to ECSEL JU. As the father of the Lighthouse Initiatives, he leaves ECSEL JU as a strong and focussed organisation, with great ideas, ambitions and prospects for the future.\u201d Sabine Herlitschka: \u201cI thank the Governing Board for its trust. ECSEL JU plays a central role for a strong Europe in a knowledge-based and increasingly digital economy and society. In a fiercely competitive global environment, ECS as key technologies are particularly challenged. ECS is inseparably linked to many other innovative industry sectors, and thus strongly contributes to keep, or even to bring back, manufacturing in Europe, to master grand challenges like climate change and ageing society, and to improve citizens\u00b4 living standards throughout Europe. Therefore, we must succeed in jointly strengthening Europe\u2019s innovative power and set the right course for the 9th EU Framework Programme. I look forward to actively contributing to this important process.\u201d Dr Herlitschka will take up office as of 15th February 2018 for a one-year mandate, from the end of the meeting until 14th February 2019. \u00a0 Press Release available\u00a0here.

She expressed her confidence in ECSEL JU as a successful mechanism for bringing together actors from various sectors and creating a highly effective cross-domain environment for the future research in electronics. Before the JU stepped in, it was extremely difficult to get Member States to agree on a common ECS strategy, but the ECSEL JU facilitates these discussions and helps in building strong collaboration between the participating States. \u201cThe ECSEL JU is not only about cooperation \u2013 it\u2019s a trustful collaboration. And that\u2019s a big difference\u201d said Mrs. Werner. The event gathered representatives from all three pillars ECSEL JU is built upon \u2013 the European Commission, represented by Mr. Khalil Rouhana, DDG from DG CNECT, Mr. Jan van den Biesen, representing the three Industry Associations (ARTEMIS-IA, AENEAS and EPoSS), and Mr. Ben Ruck, Chair of the Public Authorities Board. The Industry was also represented by Mr Patrick Pype from NXP Semiconductors, The Netherlands, and Mr Francois Tuot from Gemalto, France. The ECSEL JU representation consisted of Mr. Andrea Cuomo, Chair of the ECSEL JU Governing Board, and Mr. Bert De Colvenaer, Executive Director of the Joint Undertaking. \u201cECSEL, as well as the rest of the Joint Undertakings, is a unique endeavour of connecting different actors from industry and research centres in Europe, and we need to make sure all our industries will benefit from industrial innovation\u201d, said Khalil Rouhana. He explained that the return on investment benefits not only entities acting in the ECS field, but there are large and direct benefits for other sectors as well; and this \u2013 as well as the large \u201cleverage effect\u201d - justifies the public investment by the EU. \u201cFor every euro we spend, more than four goes directly into the projects\u201d, Mr Rouhana emphasized. Although there are many success stories, everyone agreed that there is a need to start thinking bigger. ECSEL JU is fully dedicated to securing a strong contribution towards a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, not only by strengthening the current cooperation amongst the participants in its projects but also by exploring innovative tools. This is why ECSEL JU has launched the new \u201cLighthouse Initiatives\u201d, which represent a further structuring of the already characteristic \u201cclustering\u201d activities to maximise impact in specific domains (\u201cmobility\u201d and \u201cproduction\u201d Lighthouses have already started). The guests of the meeting agreed that ECS technologies are essential for the rest of the European economy. Further developments in many sectors heavily depend on the great contribution secured by ECS technologies, and the semiconductor industry is at the heart of the value chain for different types of societal domains, said Patrick Pype. \u201cEverything needs to be \u201cconnected, smart, energy efficient and secured\u201d. For instance, at this stage, a high-end car contains more than \u20ac 500 worth in semiconductor content and this grows 5-6% per year. We can state that the semiconductor industry is a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress\u201d, concluded Patrick Pype. Francois Tuot also emphasised the role of electronics in assuring safety, reliability, privacy and security in many sectors where Europe has leadership or a significant position (e.g. Health, IoT, Smart mobility). \u201cThe cyber security market is expected to grow incredibly fast, considering general deployment of mobiles, cloud, social networks and business intelligence. Therefore, looking at threats and impact on the one hand, and opportunities on the other, it is mandatory and of paramount importance to retain sovereignty in Europe on ECS technologies\u201d. \u201cThe unique aspect of ECSEL JU is that stakeholders (Participating States, EU and industry) make a serious effort to align a strategic research agenda established by industry with national priorities and general ambitions of the EU. Trustful collaboration and communication is the ECSEL JU engine to set and reach further targets\u201d, said Ben Ruck. Jan van den Biesen, stressed that collaboration is key within ECSEL. The ECSEL JU is a unique tri-partite Public-Public-Private Partnership; 1.2 B\u20ac from EU will leverage 1.2 B\u20ac national co-funding and 2.4B\u20ac in-kind contributions from industry to jointly create the critical mass needed for delivering on industrial competitiveness, economic value and societal impact. The JU Office has proven to be very capable of managing the R&I programme in a cost-effective way. Furthermore, the industry believes that ECSEL JU is open, transparent and inclusive. It is an eco-system that includes large, medium and small enterprises, universities and institutes, and they are all indispensable for successful research. Mr van den Biesen concluded: \u201cCalls are open to anyone; you do not need to be related to an association. But even the membership of the associations is open: you just need to have R&I in Europe. A double openness.\u201d Patrick Pype added: \u201cAll these actors together create the Strategic Research Agenda, a joint effort and investment across the whole of European industry to collaborate.\u201d Bert De Colvenaer underlined that in modern times, no national economy can stand up to the global competition without mastering ECS technologies. He reflected on the necessity of continuing investment in ECS technology development, or else face having to use imported solutions for crucial societal challenges. \u201cECSEL JU is playing a key role in this sector. It is more than a funding instrument - it is also an ambitious programme with a powerful mix of short, medium and long-term vision\u201d. \u201cECSEL JU has already demonstrated that it has an important impact on the EU electronics industry and we are committed to quantify its benefits,\u201d said Andrea Cuomo. \u201cSince this unique JU\u00a0model was started in 2008, each euro invested by the EU has resulted in more than \u20ac6 (ARTEMIS, ENIAC and ECSEL JUs together) for research and innovation activities in Europe. To optimize time to market and maximize returns and job creations, ECSEL JU must work with the EP, Member States and the European Commission in order to synchronize Research, Regulation and Standardisation\u201d. Mrs Werner agreed: \u201cThe EU must create its own standardisation solution and not fall on the easy solution or focus on the US.\u201d \u201cFruitful cooperation with MEPs is crucial and the ECSEL JU is fully committed to inform all policy makers about ECSEL JU projects results and achievements\u201d, concluded Bert De Colvenaer.

To co-finance corresponding research projects from the Free State, an administrative agreement was signed today between the Federal Ministry of Research and the Thuringian Ministry of Science. \"Without a pronounced electronics competence, a leading industrial location like Germany is hardly imaginable,\" said Thuringian Minister of Economic Affairs Wolfgang Tiefensee. As a cross-sectional technology, microelectronics is a classic innovation driver and contributes significantly to strengthening the innovative power of many different industries. These include, in particular, the five areas of expertise that have developed in Thuringia with its innovation strategyfrom new production processes and systems to mobility, health economics, energy and resource efficiency, digitalisation and information technology. \"Especially for us in Thuringia, it is therefore important to invest specifically in microelectronics and to further expand our position in this area,\" says Tiefensee. Professor Wolf-Dieter Lukas, head of department at the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, commented: \"We want to help shape digitization in Germany. This requires its own competencies, especially in microelectronics. Germany is already the largest microelectronics location in Europe today. But let us not forget that our strongest competitors are in the US and Asia, and that only through cooperation at all levels in Europe can we stand up to fierce competition. This is what ECSEL does. I very much welcome the fact that Thuringia is making its contribution to this European research initiative, thereby considerably strengthening the German partners in ECSEL. \" After all, with the company X-Fab, the world's tenth largest and at the same time the largest European semiconductor manufacturer in the foundry sector has its headquarters in Thuringia. In total, the microelectronics industry in the Free State comprises around 133 companies with more than 14,000 employees and an annual turnover of 2.9 billion euros. The ECSEL initiative aims to promote EU-wide cooperation between companies and research institutes in the field of microelectronics and microsystems technology. The goal is the development of intelligent electronic systems, new digital technologies, more efficient production methods, resource-saving and reliable components and circuits. The total volume of the initiative launched in 2014 is expected to amount to more than four billion euros by 2024, of which 1.2 billion euros will be raised by the EU and the member states and another 1.7 billion euros by the private sector. Following the agreement signed today, the Federal Government and the Land intend to jointly provide the necessary co-financing in the same amount as the subsidies granted under the ECSEL for Thuringian microelectronics projects. In each case, half of this supplementary funding is allocated to both sides. According to the current draft budget, in 2018 and 2019, Thuringia will initially provide 500,000 euros each. The selected projects are selected by mutual agreement. The basis for this is the ranking, which is compiled by the experts commissioned by ECSEL.

Europe needs world-class research and innovation to maintain the quality of life of its citizens, and to ensure sustainable economic growth and job creation. In the week of 24 \u2013 26 October the JU\u2019s showcased, that European public-private partnerships (PPPs, implemented as the Joint Undertakings) were set up to drive innovation in key industrial sectors, namely in aviation, railway, electronic components & systems, health, fuel cells and hydrogen, and bio-based products and materials. Bert De Colvenaer Executive director of ECSEL Joint Undertaking welcomed all MEP\u2019s and Carlos Moedas, European Commissioner for Research, Science & Innovation. De Colvenaer emphasised that the JU\u2019s are mission-oriented organisations addressing major global challenges. De Colvenaer: \u2018By mobilising actors and investors across sectors, disciplines and borders, we are able to create new innovation ecosystems and work at the scale needed to deliver transformative breakthroughs. We do this by combining excellent science with a collaborative, open innovation approach that brings together partners and stakeholders from industry, SMEs, universities, research centres, civil society etc\u2019. He continued by explaining that JUs are delivering results that are tangible and translating into concrete benefits for European citizens that address societal challenges such as in health, energy, transport, the environment, etc. Joint Undertakings contribute to sustaining innovative solutions aimed at improving everyday living. JUs leverage significant investments from both public and private sectors. In practice, this means that ~7B\u20ac of EU funding generates more than 17B\u20ac in R&I activities. JUs stimulate further growth in Europe\u2019s private sector, boosting competitiveness and leading to new job creation. Working Breakfast The next morning, on Wednesday 25 October, a working breakfast with MEPs took place. Mr Carlo Borghini, Executive Director of Shift2Rail JU, welcomed on behalf of all JTIs the 15 MEP\u2019s present, who had graciously made time to come and listen to updates about the beautiful work of the JUs, and to express their thoughts and questions in relation to these Joint Undertakings. The last question rasied was about the collaboration and communication between the JU\u2019s. Mr Andrea Cuomo informed the attendees, by way of practical example, about an ECSEL \u201cLighthouse Initiative\u201d which focuses on the \u2018digitalisation of industry\u2019. This digitisation can only be achieved by gaining more and more IT and ECS-driven knowhow, based on platforms, standards and appropriate certifications for safety. The introduction of the \u2018Lighthouse Initiative\u2019, a concept introduced by the ECSEL Joint Undertaking to signpost specific topics of common European interest, established a credible means to create a platform by engaging with all actors, programmes and projects relevant in the field of digitisation. The attendees agreed that the meeting indeed set the basis for further fruitful discussion, and more opportunity should be made available to express thoughts and ideas around these important topics. As a result, future sessions of this format may well be planned, allowing for targeted discussion on specific aspects. \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.ecsel.eu/news/ecsel-ju-innovation-action-event"}, {"id": "ECSEL_NEWS_0152", "date": "2017-12-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European Forum for Electronic Components and Systems  2017 \u2013 Our Digital Future", "text": " The first edition of the European Forum for Electronic Components and Systems (EFECS) 2017 took place in Brussels from the 5th and 7th December under the theme \u201cOur Digital Future\u201d, jointly organized by ECSEL JU, three industry associations ARTEMIS-IA, EPoSS and AENEAS, and the European Commission (DG CNECT). The major objective of the event was to collect input about the new Strategic Research Agenda for Electronic Components and Systems (ECS-SRA). This document, currently under construction by a shared team of experts from AENEAS, ARTEMIS-IA and EPoSS, aims at developing a common strategy for Europe for RD&I in Electronic Components and Systems. EFECS provided an excellent opportunity to exchange opinions and feedback on each chapter of the document, as well as bring together project ideas related to topics presented. The event gathered more than 540 participants, including high-level industry and research representatives, as well as a wide range of crucial decision makers in the ECS sector. The three-day conference offered multiple ways to be informed, and get involved in the future development of the ECS industry in Europe. The ECSEL Joint Undertaking hosted two panel discussions dedicated to two running Lighthouse Initiatives (a new tool to address challenges across and within sectors and minimise fragmented and individual approaches in key areas), on Industry 4.0 and Mobility. This was also an opportunity to present the upcoming Calls 2018 information for ECSEL JU, together with other funding instruments, and to disseminate the results and achievements of currently running projects. The award session, concluding the three-day event, included an ECSEL JU Dissemination Award. The prize was awarded to the projects DEWI and its successor SCOTT, for the excellent job done to maximize the visibility and the potential of both projects. DEWI and SCOTT tackle safety and security issues around wireless connectivity, and the projects\u2019 consortia are led by the VIRTUAL VEHICLE Research Centre, Austria. Also, two ECSEL JU funded projects in the smart mobility domain, 3Ccar and its successor AutoDrive, both led by the INFINEON Technology, Austria, won an award for the best project poster at the exhibition, which was open for all participants during the entire event.
