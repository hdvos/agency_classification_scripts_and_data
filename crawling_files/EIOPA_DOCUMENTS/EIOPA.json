Based on the CAs\u2019 self-assessment, the three reports highlight that the independence of CAs is multi-faceted and dependent on a number of legal, institutional, operational and cultural factors. The three reports take stock of the factual situation on CAs\u2019 independence along key angles, namely, operational, financial and personal independence as well as accountability and transparency. The reports seek to factually represent the arrangements and practices reported by CAs without assessing the independence of individual CAs. Key trends CAs state that they are independent authorities, operating independently on a day-to-day basis, with sufficient financial and personal independence, and an adequate framework for ensuring accountability and transparency. \u00a0However, the precise approach and framework reported by CAs frequently varies. For instance: On operational independence, while the vast majority of CAs are established as independent bodies, a few are established under the aegis of a ministry and a limited number are required to reply to requests made by certain public bodies, such as Ministers. Not all CAs report being in a position to hire staff at the level needed for the fulfilment of their supervisory tasks. On financial independence: while almost all CAs reported adequate funding, a variety of funding models are in operation with some being subject to centralised government budget rules and a few allowing for the creation of reserves. On personal independence: while a framework is in place in most CAs, there are differences on aspects such as terms of office and removal conditions for CAs\u2019 senior management and board members, management of conflicts of interest, cooling-off periods and legal protection for staff. On transparency and accountability: CAs typically ensure public transparency through the publication of documents such as annual reports or financial statements, disclosing supervisory measures taken, and through duties to report periodically on their activities to a government entity or democratic assembly. Some publish documents in English as a way to enhance transparency. Since January 2020, the ESAs have the clear task of fostering and monitoring supervisory independence. The three ESAs have, therefore, closely coordinated their work to examine how key aspects of supervisory independence have been incorporated into the governance and activities of CAs. Read EIOPA's report Read EBA's report Read ESMA's report Next steps The reports can support CAs in assessing whether it might be desirable to seek any legislative or regulatory amendment to further improve the framework underpinning their independence. They provide ESAs with valuable information that may be considered for any future work in the field of supervisory independence. In addition, the reports may be used by the European Commission as input for its own report on the independence of CAs that it is preparing under the review clauses of the ESAs founding regulations.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/european-supervisory-authorities-publish-sectoral-reports-supervisory-independence-of"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0002", "date": "2021-10-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA welcomes Solvency II proposals from the European Commission on sustainability", "text": "The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) welcomes the Solvency II proposals of the European Commission to give mandates to EIOPA for further action on sustainable finance.

In particular, EIOPA welcomes the two mandates proposed by the European Commission regarding sustainability risks. EIOPA believes that it is important to explore prudential treatment of exposures related to assets or activities associated substantially with environmental or social objectives. Furthermore, a regular review of the scope and the calibration of parameters of the standard formula pertaining to natural catastrophe risk is an important step towards a more sustainable framework.

Opinion on the supervisory reporting of costs and charges of IORPs Costs and charges can have a substantial cumulative impact: a 1% increase in costs can have a 20% impact on the amount of pension received. Hence, in order to protect members and beneficiaries, a transparent and comprehensive view of all costs and charges is essential for IORPs, social partners and supervisors. To address this, the Opinion sets out expectations on the supervisory reporting of costs and charges of IORPs. It provides a classification of costs to be reported to national supervisors and introduces a practical guidance for supervisors and IORPs - complete with reporting templates - on how to collect data. It lays out principles for the compilation of cost information and stipulates that not only direct but also indirect costs incurred by asset managers and investment funds should be reported. The Opinion also gives guidance on the supervisory use of cost data. National supervisors are expected to assess the cost efficiency of IORPs, the affordability for sponsors and the value for money offered to members and beneficiaries. The outcomes of the comparative analysis should be considered within the supervisory review process, including in the dialogues with the IORPs\u2019 management boards. Download the opinion Read the Impact assessment Opinion on the supervision of risk assessment by IORPs providing DC schemes Members are more likely to suffer adverse consequences if risks crystallise in defined contribution (DC) pension products compared with defined benefit products. The supervisory approach to DC products needs to ensure that risks borne by DC IORPs are appropriately monitored and managed. The Opinion fosters consistent supervisory practices by providing guidance on two aspects of risk management by DC IORPs. Firstly, the Opinion calls for a greater use of quantitative elements when managing operational risks, supplementing EIOPA\u2019s existing opinion. Secondly, it expects DC IORPs to conduct long-term risk assessments by using projections of members\u2019 future retirement income, comparing the results with the established risk tolerance of the members and beneficiaries, and as appropriate considering the IORP\u2019s investment strategies. Download the opinion Read the impact assessment Background The two Opinions are applicable immediately and addressed to national competent authorities as defined in Article 4(2) of the EIOPA Regulation. EIOPA is mandated by Article 29(1)(a) of its Regulation to issue supervisory Opinions to foster a\u00a0 consistent and effective application of supervisory practices across the European Union. In line with Article 29, EIOPA analysed the potential costs and benefits relating to the opinions using EIOPA\u2019s impact assessment methodology.

The proposals largely share EIOPA\u2019s approach and follow the objectives set in EIOPA\u2019s Opinion from December 2020. EIOPA particularly welcomes the proposal of the European Commission to develop an Insurance Recovery and Resolution Directive, to include the macroprudential perspective in Solvency II, to enhance the proportionality principle, and to give mandates for further action on sustainable finance. Furthermore, the new extrapolation methodology of the Risk Free curve, the adjustments of the interest risk rate as well as additional tools and measures to address systemic risk are welcome steps. Effective cross-border supervision is a precondition for consumer protection therefore the intention of the European Commission to strengthen EIOPA\u2019s role in cross-border supervision is of particular importance. We need to consider the extent to which EIOPA has the means to act in cases where identified problems in the market are not being resolved. The ability of EIOPA to identify these issues is a real benefit of the Solvency II framework, however, without the tools and powers to act leaves EIOPA in an uncomfortable position given the mission to safeguard financial stability and protect policyholders. From a perspective of consumer protection, EIOPA deeply regrets that the minimum harmonisation of the Insurance Guarantee Schemes at EU level has not been considered. The review of Solvency II and the newly proposed Insurance Recovery and Resolution Directive constituted an excellent window of opportunity to address the existing fragmentation in the field of Insurance Guarantee Schemes. As a result of the current fragmentation, policyholders receive different levels of protection in the event of an insurer\u2019s failure operating within the EU, depending on the country from where the insurance policy originates. Consequently, EIOPA continues to believe that this issue needs to be tackled as it may seriously undermine the functioning of and trust in the European Single Market. To avoid scenarios that harm policyholders, an important element of Solvency II is its prudence. EIOPA\u2019s advice recommended a more favourable but prudent treatment of illiquid liabilities as well as a balanced update overall. In EIOPA\u2019s view the removal of illiquidity considerations for the purpose of volatility adjustment calculations on the one hand and relaxations regarding the calibration on the risk margin and interest risk capital charge on the other, pose potential risks. Finally, while EIOPA is pleased with the consideration taken on board that low-risk insurers would be relieved of certain requirements, it is important that the proportionality principle in Solvency II is embedded in the supervisory review process. This approach would give the supervisors more flexibility to allow application by insurers of proportionality also during the supervisory review process. This would keep proportionality as a principle instead of transforming it into a \u2018set of rules\u2019. Taking into account that the review process is only starting, EIOPA stands ready to support further the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council in the review process.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopas-comment-solvency-ii-proposals-european-commission"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0010", "date": "2021-09-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA publishes approach for Interbank Offered Rates transitions", "text": "The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published today its approach for the implementation of Interbank Offered Rates (IBOR) transitions including with regards to timing and implementation.

The independence of supervisory authorities is crucial for the legitimacy and credibility of the supervisory process.

The criteria provide clarity for supervisory authorities on EIOPA\u2019s expectations.

The report highlights the increasing vulnerabilities across the financial sector, the rise seen in terms of cyber risk and the materialisation of event-driven risks. As the recovery begins, the appropriate phasing out of exceptional crisis measures plays a key role. Despite the positive outlook, the expectations for economic recovery remain uncertain and uneven across member states. Vulnerabilities in the financial sector are increasing, not least because of side effects of the crisis measures, such as increasing debt levels and upward pressure on asset prices. Expectations of inflation- and yield growth, as well as increased investor risk-taking and financial interconnectedness issues, might put additional pressure on the financial system. The financial sector is also increasingly exposed to cyber risk. The financial sector has been hit by cyber-attacks more often than other sectors, while across the digital economy, cyber-criminals are developing new techniques to exploit vulnerabilities. Financial institutions will have to rapidly adapt their technical infrastructure in response to the pandemic, and the crisis has acted as a catalyst for digital transformation more generally. Finally, the materialisation of event-driven risks (such as GameStop, Archegos, Greensill), as well as rising prices and volumes traded on crypto-assets, raise questions about increased risk-taking behaviour and possible market exuberance. Concerns about the sustainability of current market valuations remain, and current trends need to show resilience over an extended period of time for a more positive risk assessment. In light of the above-mentioned risks and uncertainties, the ESAs advise national competent authorities, financial institutions and market participants to take the following policy actions: financial institutions and supervisors should continue to be prepared for a possible deterioration of asset quality in the financial sector, notwithstanding the improved economic outlook; as the economic environment gradually improves, the focus should shift to allow a proper assessment of the consequences of the pandemic on banks\u2019 lending books, and banks should adequately manage the transition towards the recovery phase; disorderly increases in yields and sudden reversals of risk premia should be closely monitored in terms of their impacts for financial institutions as well as for investors; financial institutions and supervisors should continue to carefully manage their ICT and cyber risks. The ESAs also consider that policymakers, regulators, financial institutions and supervisors can start reflecting on lessons learnt from the COVID-19 crisis.

Twelve NCAs have fully implemented the recommended actions addressed to them, whereas six NCAs have only partially implemented them.\u00a0 The 2018 peer review also identified best practices in strengthening the supervision of key functions.

EIOPA therefore adapted its priorities following the onset of the pandemic to support both industry and supervisors in tackling different challenges and maintain supervisory convergence and financial stability. This included carrying out extraordinary activities (for example supervisory statements to deal with the new risks and situations) and re-prioritising some other planned tasks. Supervisory activities in 2020 covered a variety of areas, including Solvency II related issues such as calculation of technical provisions, the further development of supervisory activities in the area of conduct risk, and the analysis of innovative technologies and their role in improving supervisory practices. At the request of the European Commission, EIOPA finalised its advice on the 2020 review of Solvency II.

During 2020, EIOPA has continued its prudential oversight work and strengthened its oversight activities on conduct of business, initiating bilateral visits to national competent authorities (NCAs). Furthermore, EIOPA continued work to increase supervisory convergence in the area of internal models. Sound supervision of cross border activities remains essential to build trust with consumers and demonstrate a well-functioning internal market. Cooperation platforms are a key tool in cross-border supervision and, by the end of 2020, six cooperation platforms (involving of 21 NCAs) were operational, resulting in a number of actions taken in good time to minimise detriment to consumers. For some of the platforms the intensive cooperation is continuing into 2021. In 2021, EIOPA will complete the priorities stemming from the previous plans, while also continuing to monitor and mitigate the impact of Covid-19.

After a number of years of the implementation of Solvency II and the information received by national supervisory authorities it is important to ensure that the regular supervisory reporting remains fit for purpose. The analysis over the last years lead to a number of proposals to amend the Solvency II Directive and its Delegated Regulation. These were put forward by EIOPA in the Opinion on the 2020 review of Solvency II. However, the experience also showed that there is a need to implement amendments to reporting requirements within the current legal framework, without waiting for the Solvency II review. In this consultation paper, EIOPA proposes amendments to the reporting requirements, which are mainly based on the Report on quantitative reporting templates published together with the 2020 Solvency II Opinion. In addition to those changes, the proposals include simplification of quarterly reporting for all undertakings, elimination of some reporting templates for all undertakings and new thresholds to promote better risk-based and proportionate reporting requirements. This will lead to a reduction of the number of templates to be reported for the majority of the undertakings. EIOPA proposals on the review of the reporting requirements should bring several benefits, which will ultimately lead to a better protection of policyholders: Reduction of reporting costs for the majority of insurance undertakings; Inclusion of information needed for supervisory purposes focusing on emerging risks and new areas for which supervisors identified a number of data gaps; A more fit-for-purpose reporting, for example reducing and simplifying when possible but also accommodating gaps identified by supervisors. EIOPA invites all interested stakeholders to provide comments to the amendments by e-mail to CP-21-002@eiopa.europa.eu by 17 October 2021.

The aim of the supervisory statement is to ensure that a high-quality and convergent supervision is applied to run-off undertakings or portfolios that are subject to Solvency II regulation. Acquisition of run-off portfolios and run-off undertakings by other insurance undertakings is increasing and is attracting interest from specialised investment entities such as private equity. EIOPA believes that it is essential to specify supervisory expectations to better consider and deal with potential risks stemming from run-off business models. The supervision of run-off undertakings is particularly challenging because of the specific risk profile of such undertakings e.g. in relation to the changes in ownership. In addition, there is a lack of specific regulation for run-off undertakings in the Solvency II framework. The supervisory statement covers the authorization of acquisition of run-off undertakings or portfolio, the ongoing supervision as well as the prudential and conduct of business issues. In particular, EIOPA recommends potential acquirer an early dialogue with national supervisors to communicate the intention to run off the full (or material) part of insurance obligations. As part of the ongoing supervision, national supervisory authorities should perform a business model analysis with a specific focus on how the undertaking is expected to remain profitable in the near future. Furthermore, the focus should also be on ensuring the compliance with Solvency II rules such as technical provisions, investments, reinsurance and at the same time making sure that policyholders are treated fairly.

As part of the 2020 review of Solvency II, EIOPA identified several divergent practices regarding the implementation and supervision of calculation of technical provisions. In order to ensure a convergent application of Solvency II and its delegated regulation in this area the revision of the existing guidelines is required in addition to the improvements identified in the Opinion on the Solvency II 2020 review. Consultation paper on the revision of the Guidelines on contract boundaries of insurance and reinsurance contracts The Guidelines on contract boundaries promote a consistent application of an insurance or reinsurance contract boundary. A contract boundary specifies whether the additional cover arising from policyholders\u2019 options is regarded as existing or future business. The new and amended guidelines provide further detailed guidance on the already existing requirements. They focus on the unbundling of an insurance and reinsurance contract and the assessment whether a financial guarantee or a cover has a discernible effect on the economics of the contract. In particular, the new guidance focuses on the aim of unbundling, ensuring that one contract has the same treatment regardless whether it is sold as one contract or as two independent contracts where both are equivalent in terms of risk. EIOPA invites stakeholders to respond to the survey until 12 November 2021. Consultation paper on the revision of the Guidelines on Valuation of Technical Provisions The Guidelines on valuation of technical provisions aim to increase consistency and convergence of professional practice for all types and sizes of undertakings across the EU Member States and to support undertakings in calculating their technical provisions under Solvency II. In the new and amended guidelines, EIOPA clarifies that where contracts with material options and guarantees exist, undertakings are expected to use a valuation method that captures the time value of these contracts. Guidelines addressing expert judgement, a key component of the calculation of technical provisions, are proposed based on the existing Guidelines on the use of internal models, which were already applicable for technical provision valuation purposes.

EIOPA\u2019s deliverables support the EU Commission\u2019s new Sustainable Finance Strategy in striving for greater protection against climate and environmental risks through insurance coverage, and integrating sustainability risks in the prudential framework for insurers. Pilot dashboard for the natural catastrophe protection gap EIOPA\u2019s first pilot dashboard depicts the insurance protection gap for natural catastrophes in Europe. The pilot dashboard brings together data on economic and insured losses, vulnerabilities and exposure, as well as insurance coverage across the EU Member States. The data show that only 35% of the total losses caused by extreme weather and climate-related events across Europe are insured. The dashboard will help in identifying regions at risk, the drivers of a climate-related insurance protection gap, as well as defining proactive prevention measures. It should allow for evidence-based decision-making on measures to improve society\u2019s resilience against natural catastrophes at a time when losses to properties and businesses are expected to grow due to climate change.\u00a0 \u00a0 Methodological paper for integrating climate change in underwriting risk capital charge of the Solvency II standard formula EIOPA proposes methodological steps which support the need to formalise an approach to re-assess and, where needed, recalibrate parameters for the natural catastrophe risk module of the\u00a0Solvency II standard formula on a regular basis. The regular re-assessment or recalibration would integrate new considerations such as use of models, which explicitly consider climate change, as well as the possibility to include new countries. The paper also identifies the need to enhance the understanding on emerging perils such as wildfire or droughts. The methodology takes into account that the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes is expected to increase due to climate change. The solvency capital requirements for natural catastrophe underwriting risk therefore need to reflect the expected impact of climate change to ensure the financial resilience of (re)insurers covering natural catastrophes.

EIOPA emphasizes that the pandemic crisis is still not over and many uncertainties remain despite the progress in vaccination campaigns and decreasing trends in the number of new infections. The impact on the real economy was reduced by extensive fiscal measures, but some negative effects might become visible only when the introduced measures will phase out. In particular, increased unemployment and corporate credit downgrades would have a negative impact on both insurance and pension sectors. While the EU economy is still subject to high risks, some lessons learnt have already been reflected in the Solvency II review by taking into account the changes in the current economic enviroment. The ongoing crisis also highlighted the critical importance of coordinated approaches among the national competent authorities. It is also essential to keep the focus on new emerging risks such as cyber and climate risk. Remote working arrangements in the pandemic caused increased cyber-attacks reiterating the growing importance of risks related to digitalisation. Environmental, social and governance factors that increasingly shape investment decisions of insurers and pension funds and affect their underwriting, remain one of the focal points for the insurance and pension industry. In the sensitivity analysis on asset side transition risks published at the end of 2020, EIOPA has been tackling developments in this area, also from the financial stability perspective. The crisis showed that with Solvency II in place, the insurance industry was overall well prepared. However, there is a need to continuously analyse all risks.

In a year dominated by COVID-19, EIOPA played a key role in insurance and pensions supervision in Europe.\u00a0 \tEIOPA\u2019s actions related to COVID-19 ranged from putting in place immediate measures to enable the sector to focus on business continuity and obligations to policyholders and beneficiaries, to providing information directly to consumers on what they should expect from their insurance company. In addition, in the area of financial stability, EIOPA issued Statement on dividends distribution and variable remuneration policies in the context of COVID-19. In the area of consumer protection, EIOPA continued to strengthen its work in the area of conduct of business supervision, including defining the approach to the supervision of product oversight and governance. A key achievement in insurance supervision was the publication of the Opinion on the review of Solvency II, which reflected a balanced approach taking account of the challenging times, including the impact of COVID-19 on the insurance sector. In terms of financial stability, in 2020, EIOPA focused its effort on monitoring and mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Examples of work in this area included the Statement on dividends distribution and variable remuneration policies in the context of COVID-19, the Risk Dashboard and regular monitoring and reporting on financial stability. Progress was made in the area of pensions, notably finalising the regulation for the Pan-European Personal Pensions product, or PEPP, as well as furthering work in the areas of the pensions dashboard and pensions tracking system. All three will be important in closing pensions gaps. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the use of digital technology by consumers and businesses and EIOPA continued to advance its work in this area, where the overarching aim is to enable consumer to benefit from digital innovation, but without detriment. Considerable progress was also made in the area of sustainable finance, including supporting the development of the EU taxonomy, and a range of activities in the area of climate change. Looking ahead, the role of insurers and pension funds in the economic recovery from COVID-19 cannot be underestimated as both sectors will play an important role in fostering green and digital transitions and fostering a Capital Markets Union.

The report builds on recent international and EU developments in the area of digitalisation and AI. EIOPA convened the consultative expert group so that a wide range of stakeholders could work together identifying the opportunities and risks associated with the growing use of AI in insurance, including exploring possible limits that might be needed. The report highlights the proliferation of AI in insurance. For instance, AI allows insurance companies to carry out more granular risk assessments and pricing practices, increasingly efficient claims management processes, and enables insurance companies to fight against fraud more effectively. Benefits such as prediction accuracy, automation, new products and services, and cost reductions can be remarkable. However, ensuring fairness, non-discrimination, transparency and explainability can be challening: there is work for firms to address these challenges. The issues raised are of critical importance in the face of the digital transformation currently underway in the sector. Developing a sound AI governance framework is therefore essential for a well-functioning, trusted and financially inclusive insurance sector. The report aims to help insurance companies when putting in place risk-based and proportionate measures, providing guidance on how to implement key principles in practice throughout the lifecycle of an AI application. The guidance is non-binding and illustrative. EIOPA welcomes the findings from the consultative expert group, and believes they provide a highly valuable starting point for better establishing the boundaries for the appropriate use of AI in insurance. EIOPA will use these findings to identify possible supervisory initiatives in this area taking into account the on-going developments at EU level related to digitalisation and AI. Download the report Background In September 2019, EIOPA established the Consultative Expert Group as a follow-up of its thematic review on the use of Big Data Analytics in motor and health insurance, with a mandate to examine AI in insurance from an ethical perspective. The thematic review identified a strong trend towards data-driven business models in the European insurance market. Data has become a very valuable resource and the availability of data continues to increase. Technology has also advanced and this has enabled the use of AI to gain more insight in consumer behaviour. The COVID-19 crisis has also accelerated this trend.

The amendments reflect: the recognition of two new credit rating agencies (CRAs); the outcome of a monitoring exercise on the adequacy of existing mappings; and the deregistration of a number of CRAs. The ITS are part of the EU Single Rulebook for banking and insurance aimed at creating a safe and sound regulatory framework consistently applicable across the European Union (EU). Since the adoption in 2019 of the ITS on the mapping of credit assessments of ECAIs, two additional CRAs have been recognised and a number of CRAs have ben de-registered. The ITS have therefore, been amended to reflect the allocation of appropriate risk weights to the newly established ECAIs, and to remove the reference to the de-registered ECAIs. Furthermore, the amendments reflect the outcome of a monitoring exercise on the adequacy of the existing mappings, based on the additional quantitative and qualitative information collected after the original Implementing Regulation entered into force. In particular, the ESAs propose to change the Credit Quality Step (CQS) allocation for two ECAIs, and to introduce new credit rating scales for nine ECAIs. The ESAs also published individual draft mapping reports illustrating how the methodology was applied to produce the amended mappings, in line with the mandate from the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). Go to the ITS Legal Basis and background The proposed revised draft ITSs have been developed according to Article 136 (1) and (3) of Regulation 575/2013 (CRR) and of Article 109 (a) of Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II Directive), which state that revised draft ITS\u00a0 shall be submitted by the ESAs, where necessary. The ITS, developed by the ESAs and adopted by the European Commission on 7 and 11 October 2016, aim at ensuring that only credit ratings issued by External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) \u2013 those credit rating agencies (CRAs) registered under Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 or central banks issuing credit ratings exempt from the application of the same regulation - can be used for calculating capital requirements of financial institutions and insurance undertakings. To this aim, the three ESAs have specified an approach that establishes the correspondence -or mapping- between credit assessments and the credit quality steps defined in the EU prudential regulation for banking (Capital Requirements Regulation \u2013 CRR) and EU insurance regulation (Solvency II Directive).", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/esas-publish-amended-technical-standards-mapping-of-ecais"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0035", "date": "2021-06-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Bankruptcy of Gefion Finans A/S under frivillig likvidation (formerly Gefion Insurance A/S)", "text": "On 07 June 2021, the Danish Maritime and Commercial High Court declared the bankruptcy of Gefion Finans A/S under frivillig likvidation (formerly Gefion Insurance A/S). The company operated in Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom under \u201cfreedom of services\u201d offering mainly motor insurance and motor liability insurance. The Danish Guarantee Fund will only cover risks (within the scope of coverage) in Denmark for insurance policies written in Denmark. This means that European policyholders outside of Denmark need to check with their national insurance guarantee scheme whether their losses are protected. More information including Questions and Answers for policyholders can also be found here. EIOPA regrets that equal and adequate protection of policyholders and claimants still cannot be ensured throughout Europe due to the absence of harmonisation of national Insurance Guarantee Schemes at EU level, within the broader context of recovery and resolution. In order to better protect European policyholders, EIOPA in its Solvency II Opinion proposed the introduction of a European network of national Insurance Guarantee Schemes, which should meet a minimum set of harmonised features and ensure similar level of protection of European policyholders throughout the internal market. Background EIOPA, in close contact with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet), coordinated the dialogue regarding this Danish insurance company between home and host supervisors via a cooperation platform since end 2018. The aim of the cooperation platform was stronger and timely cooperation between national supervisors in the assessment of the impact of cross-border activities and identification of preventive measures. In March 2020, the Finanstilsynet ordered the insurer to stop writing new business after the Finanstilsynet refused to approve the insurer\u2019s recovery plan addressing its insufficient Solvency Capital Requirement.

The Report is meant to provide guidance to the European Commission in the context of its review of the functioning of the SECR. It also provides initial inputs to the ongoing discussion on the efficiency of the securitisation framework given the role that securitisation could play in the recovery post the Covid-19 pandemic. The SECR, which became applicable in January 2019, has been useful in increasing the overall soundness of the EU securitisation market and in reducing the stigma of securitisation products. However, some adjustments could be considered to further improve the overall consistency of the existing framework. In particular, the Report highlights: Transparency requirements: given the trend in increasing issuances of private securitisations and considering the SECR objectives of access of information and investor protection, a more precise legal definition for private securitisations should be specified in the SECR in order to clearly identify private securitisations that should comply with the transparency requirements. Data reported for those private securitisations should also be made available by means of a securitisation repository in order to ensure high quality data and facilitate the supervision of the compliance with the transparency requirements. Due diligence requirements: regulatory guidance would be useful to specify how proportionality could be implemented in the area of due-diligence to facilitate entrance of new investors in the EU securitisation market. Criteria for simple, transparent and standardised (STS) securitisation: targeted amendments in the STS criteria would be needed to facilitate the use of the STS label for ABCP programmes. In addition, in the medium term, as more STS issuances are executed and the STS market reaches a stable pace, further analysis should be performed by the European Commission with ESAs\u2019 support to determine how the STS criteria could be simplified without reducing the quality of the standard. Supervision of securitisation requirements: in order to further enhance the supervision of securitisation requirements, it is deemed necessary to explore i) how to develop common EU supervisory tools, ii) potential alternatives to the current STS supervisory framework, in particular for those jurisdictions with limited STS securitisation issuances and, iii) the relevance of a common EU approach to the ongoing supervision of authorisation conditions for third-party verifiers (TPVs). Download the report Legal Basis This Report has been developed in accordance with Article 44 of the SECR (Reg. EU 2017/2402) which requires that the JC of ESAs delivers a first report on the implementation and the functioning of the SECR by January 2021. In accordance with the mandate, the analysis focuses on the implementation of the general requirements applicable to all securitisations, including the risk retention, due-diligence and transparency requirements as well as on the specific requirements related to STS securitisations.

The 2021 stress test focuses on a prolonged COVID-19 scenario - in a \u201clower for longer\u201d interest rate environment. The scenario, developed in cooperation with the European Systemic Risk board (ESRB), will assess the impact of economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, which affect confidence worldwide and prolong the economic contraction.

Draft Opinion on the supervisory reporting of costs and charges of IORPs This consultation paper sets out the draft Opinion on the supervisory reporting of costs and charges of IORPs. Considering that costs and charges can have a detrimental impact on future retirement income and/or sponsor contributions, a transparent and comprehensive view of all costs and charges is essential for IORPs, social partners and supervisors. The draft Opinion sets out expectations on the supervisory reporting of costs and charges of IORPs, using a proportional and risk-based approach. It provides a generic classification of all costs to be reported to national supervisors, including templates, both for supervisors to collect cost information from IORPs and to assist IORPs to collect cost information from investment managers. Moreover, principles are provided for the compilation of the cost information. Most notably the look-through principle, meaning that not only direct investment costs have to be reported but also indirect costs at the level of investment managers. The draft Opinion also provides guidance on the supervisory use of the cost data. National supervisors are expected to assess the efficiency of IORPs, affordability for sponsors and the value for money offered to members and beneficiaries, not considering the costs in isolation, but in conjunction with risk and return characteristics. The results of such benchmarking exercises should feed into the supervisory review process and the regular dialogue with the IORPs\u2019 management boards. Download the consultation paper Respond Draft Opinion on the supervision of risk assessment by IORPs providing DC schemes The first consultation paper sets out the draft Opinion on the supervision of risk assessment by IORPs providing DC schemes. Considering the ongoing shift from defined benefit (DB) to DC pension provision, a risk-sensitive supervisory approach to DC risk management is necessary to ensure that risks borne by DC IORPs and members and beneficiaries are appropriately managed and supervised. The draft Opinion provides guidance on the supervision of long-term risk assessment by DC IORPs, applying a risk-based and proportionate approach. It focuses on two aspects of DC risk management: - Firstly, the use of quantitative elements in operational risk management, supplementing the guidance in the existing Opinion on the supervision of the management of operational risks faced by IORPs. Secondly, the use of projections of future retirement income in assessing long-term risks from the perspective of members and beneficiaries, also in interaction with the establishment of their risk tolerance and the design of investment strategies.

In this Opinion EIOPA sets out expectations on the supervision of the integration of climate change risk scenarios by insurers in their ORSA.\u00a0 The (re)insurance industry will be impacted by climate change-related physical and transition risks. However, only a minority of insurers assess climate change risks in the ORSA using scenario analysis, usually limited to a short-term time horizon. Therefore, EIOPA considers it essential to foster a forward-looking management of these risks to ensure the long-term solvency and viability of the industry.\u00a0 National supervisory authorities should expect insurers to integrate climate change risks in their system of governance, risk-management system and ORSA, similar to all risks undertakings are or could be exposed to. In the ORSA, insurers should do an assessment to identify material climate change risk exposures and subject the material exposures to a risk assessment. Climate change risks should be assessed not only in the short term but also in the long term using scenario analysis to inform the strategic planning and business strategy. Insurers should subject material climate change risks to at least two long-term climate scenarios, where appropriate: a climate change risk scenario where the global temperature increase remains below 2\u00b0C, preferably no more than 1.5\u00b0C, in line with the EU commitments; and a climate change risk scenario where the global temperature increase exceeds 2\u00b0C.\u00a0 The Opinion follows a risk-based and proportionate approach, recognising that methodologies are still developing and insurers need to gain experience. Insurers are expected to evolve the sophistication of the scenario analyses, taking into account the size, nature and complexity of their climate change risk exposures. The Opinion provides practical guidance on how to select and use climate change scenarios. EIOPA expects national supervisors to collect qualitative and quantitative data to perform a supervisory review of the analysis of short and long-term climate change risks in the ORSA.

The report also presents some considerations on the impact of COVID-19 on these products. For insurance-based investment products (IBIPs) Overall, in line with general market trends, 2019 was an extremely positive year for the IBIPs market at European level and positive net return across all Members States.\u00a0 The net performance of profit participation products, despite being steadily positive in all years of the analysis, is low, in particular when considering the impact inflation can have in some markets.\u00a0 In terms of costs, profit participation products continue to be less costly than unit-linked and hybrid products, in terms of reduction in yield (RIY) at recommended holding period (RHP).\u00a0 The performance of unit-linked products varies according to the level of risk being taken, while for profit participation products, the recommended holding period is the main factor.\u00a0 The report includes some specific analysis of hybrid products; while these seek to combine the benefits of profit-participation and unit-linked products, they are generally more costly and complex, raising some potential challenges in assessing them. Finally, administrative costs represents on average the dominant cost driver, followed by investment management costs and distribution costs. Biometric costs are minor.\u00a0 Overall, instances of high costs have been reported, raising questions on value for money. Personal pension products (PPP) Personal pension products showed similar trends to IBIPs. Those similar to unit-linked benefited from higher returns for higher risks; in general, particularly for those similar to profit-participation, longer holding periods also correlated with higher returns. An absence of harmonised reporting has continued to raise data challenges. Download the report Background The report is published following a request from the European Commission to the European Supervisory Authorities to periodically report on the costs and past performance of retail investment products.

This consultation is a response to EIOPA\u2019s repeatedly highlighted concerns that, while unit-linked products can and often do offer important benefits for policyholders, costs for some unit-linked products continue to remain too high. Existing concerns have been heightened by the COVID-19 crisis. The low interest rate environment coupled to market shocks and the risk that households will need increased access to liquidity, underline how important it is that unit-linked products always offer value to consumers.\u00a0 EIOPA considers that reliably putting consumer outcomes at the heart of product design, distribution and monitoring processes is critical for tackling value for money issues, and that a European approach is needed to support the development of a stronger Capital Markets Union. Towards that goal, in its paper EIOPA presents the framework setting out how to assess whether unit-linked (and hybrid) products offer value for money, taking into account the needs, objectives and characteristics of a target market. The framework is centred around the principles that: Value offered by unit-linked (and hybrid) products should be assessed both taking into account the product as a whole as well as each product component (investment, insurance and guarantees, if any).\u00a0 When products are tested, manufacturers should assess the product features and characteristics, including costs and the reward profile of the products, vis-\u00e0-vis the target market characteristics, objectives and needs and they should ensure that no \u2018undue\u2019 costs are charged to consumers. \u00a0\u00a0 Products which are difficult for consumers to understand should have more granular target markets and adequate measures in place to mitigate complexity related risks. \u00a0 The framework is a first step towards a broader set of tools. These would provide further guidance for firms and supervisors for assessing when costs are undue, and to aid them in testing the value for money of products and by providing practical benchmarks.\u00a0 EIOPA is seeking a market where consumers can be confident that the products on sale offer good value for money, including where they combine insurance and investment benefits. A flourishing unit-linked market could thereby significantly contribute to the development of the Capital Markets Union. It could also be a cornerstone for more sustainable household investments and savings. EIOPA invites all interested stakeholders for concrete feedback on the different principles and guidance until 16 July 2021 by filling out the EU Survey. A public event to further discuss the framework will also be organized by EIOPA.\u00a0 Background Unit-linked products - In gross-written premium terms unit-linked products are the most predominant insurance-based investment product in Europe, which amounted to EUR 340 billion for 2019. According to EIOPA\u2019s estimate unit-linked products account for a significant portion \u2013 over EUR 2.8 trillions of the total asset under management in Europe. The figure is approximate due to the fact that the reporting is based on risks rather than products. \tValue for money - While value for money is not explicitly defined in EU legislation, the Product and Oversight Governance (POG) framework clearly highlights that products characteristics \u2013 which include costs \u2013 need to be tested to ensure they are aligned to the target market\u2019s needs, objectives and characteristics, which also includes the target market\u2019s ability to pay and bear losses. Despite this, there is a need for more harmonised guidance to implement POG requirements and address consumer detriment arising from products where the costs and charges are not proportionate to the benefits and hence where products do not offer value to the target market.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-consults-framework-address-value-money-risk-european-unit-linked-market"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0051", "date": "2021-04-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA publishes the results from its yearly study on the modelling of market and credit risk", "text": "The European insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published today the results from its yearly study on the modelling of market and credit risk (MCRCS).

As in past studies, the overall results continue to show significant variations in asset model outputs, which are partly attributable to model and business specificities already known by the relevant national competent authorities, but also indicate a need for further supervisory scrutiny.\u00a0 The results, tools and experience feed into the Supervisory Review Process on internal models, and are also used to assess model changes or models in pre-applications. The report shows the following conclusions Credit risk charges for sovereign bonds across groups of modelling approaches show relatively low variation for bonds issued by Germany, Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, and France. The variation is greater for the bonds issued by Ireland, Portugal Spain, and Italy. These results are influenced by firms which show zero or low credit risk shocks across the instruments. Credit risk charges for corporate bonds are generally higher for bonds with lower credit ratings and the variation increases materially with worsening credit quality. The variation becomes substantial for BB-rated bonds. This demonstrates the variety of modelling assumptions being made by firms, particularly for low rated bonds. Equity and real estate risks. With respect to equity risk, undertakings in general show less variation in the risk charges for major equity indices compared to risk charges applied to the strategic equity participations. Risk charges applied to the five real estate benchmark investments vary to a larger extent compared to equity. Additionally, for real estate category, model calibrations tend to place more emphasis on the risk profile of the undertakings\u2019 actual investment portfolio and less on publicly available indices.

The report highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic continues to weigh heavily on short-term recovery prospects. It also highlights a number of vulnerabilities in the financial markets and warns of possible further market corrections.\u00a0 Macroeconomic conditions improved in the second half of 2020, supported by ongoing fiscal and monetary policy efforts, but the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic since the last quarter of 2020 has led to increasing economic uncertainty. The start of the rollout of vaccinations provides a crucial anchor for medium-term expectations, but insufficient production capacities, delays in deliveries as well as risks related to mutations of the virus are weighing heavily on short-term recovery prospects.\u00a0 Macroeconomic uncertainty was generally not reflected in asset valuations and market volatility which have recovered to pre-crisis levels, highlighting a continued risk of decoupling of valuations from economic fundamentals.\u00a0 In light of these risks and uncertainties, the ESAs advise, national competent authorities, financial institutions and market participants to take the following policy actions: Prepare for an expected deterioration of asset quality: banks should adjust provisioning models to adequately address the impact of the economic shock of the pandemic and to ensure a timely recognition of adequate levels of provisions. They should engage to restructure over indebted but viable exposure efficiently. To supervisors, banks\u2019 provisioning policies should continue to be a point of particular attention;\u00a0 Continue to develop further actions to accommodate a \u201clow-for-long\u201d interest rate environment and its risks: while low interest rates are important to support economic activity, they negatively impact banks\u2019 interest income and remain the main risk for the life insurance and pension fund sector. For insurers, it is important that the regulatory framework also reflects the steep fall in interest rates experienced in recent years and the existence of negative interest rates. Financial institutions should also continue to monitor, and be prepared for, changes in interest rates, especially in light of the recent upward shifts of long-term interest rates and the consequent concerns about re-emerging inflationary pressures; Ensure sound lending practices and adequate pricing of risks: banks should continue to make thorough risk assessments to ensure that lending remains viable in the future, and this should be closely monitored by supervisors. Banks should continue to make thorough risk assessments to ensure that lending remains viable, including after public support measures such as loan moratoria and public guarantee schemes will expire; Follow conservative policies on dividends and share buy-backs: any distributions should not exceed thresholds of prudency; and Investment funds should further enhance their preparedness in the face of potential increases in redemptions and valuation shocks: to this end the alignment of fund investment strategy, liquidity profile and redemption policy should be supervised, as well as funds\u2019 liquidity risk assessment and valuation processes in a context of valuation uncertainty.\u00a0 Download the report \u00a0 Background The three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices.

The KNF has identified risks for policyholders buying unit-linked insurance products in Poland, and has informed EIOPA and competent authorities of a proposed product intervention measure under Article 17 of the PRIIPs Regulation. The proposed measure aims to address product profitability, some of the investments being offered, and how fees and commissions are disclosed. The product intervention powers under the PRIIPs Regulation are a last resort measure to address and prevent specific significant investor protection concerns and should be used by competent authorities only under the strict conditions set out in the PRIIPs Regulation. In particular, the powers can only be used if applicable regulatory requirements under Union law do not sufficiently address the risks identified and the issue would not be better addressed by improved supervision or enforcement of existing requirements.\u00a0 Following an analysis of the case, EIOPA concluded that there are significant investor protection concerns that should be addressed. The Polish unit-linked market appears, on the basis of data available to EIOPA, to be an outlier when compared to other European markets, notably due to the high level of costs. A targeted product intervention measure to address risks associated with product profitability can be justified in the interest of consistent and timely action. Action is also justified and proportionate with regard to certain highly risky investments in contingent convertibles.\u00a0 However, EIOPA is of the view that the proposed product intervention measure is not justified or proportionate for tackling other concerns with the investments being offered, or the transparency of fees and commissions. Other supervisory or regulatory measures could be considered instead.\u00a0 EIOPA has highlighted concerns over the years with some unit-linked life insurance products, and has identified the emergence of similar value for money risks to those highlighted by KNF in the wider European market. This requires further coordinated action at the EU level, so as to tackle risks for consumers and avoid similar product interventions being necessary in the future. EIOPA therefore will launch a public consultation on measures to address value for money risks to ensure good outcomes for European consumers. Read the Opinion Background Product intervention powers under Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (PRIIPs Regulation) The PRIIPs Regulation confers product intervention powers to national competent authorities (NCAs) and EIOPA. According to these powers, NCAs and EIOPA can prohibit or restrict in the Union the marketing, distribution or sale of Insurance-Based Investment Products (IBIPs) with certain specified features or a type of financial activity or practice of an insurance or reinsurance undertaking. The use of these powers by NCAs is subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions: the issue raises either a significant investor protection concern, a threat to the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or a threat to the stability of the whole or part of the financial system and no existing regulatory requirements under Union law applicable to the IBIP, activity or practice do not sufficiently address the risks identified and the issue would not be better addressed by improved supervision or enforcement of existing requirements. Legal basis Pursuant to Article 18(2) of the PRIIPs Regulation, EIOPA is required to adopt and publish an opinion on whether a planned product intervention by a NCA is justified and proportionate. If EIOPA considers that taking measures by other competent authorities is necessary to address the risk, it must state this in the Opinion. The Opinion is formulated on the basis of the information provided by the relevant NCA, including details on the nature of the risk, supportive evidence and the scope and nature of intended product intervention measure.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-partially-supports-planned-prohibition-of-some-unit-linked-life-insurance-products"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0061", "date": "2021-03-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESAs Joint Board of Appeal dismissed appeal by Appellant \u201cA\u201d against the European Securities and Markets Authority", "text": "The Joint Board of Appeal of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs \u2013 European Banking Authority, European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, and European Securities and Markets Authority) unanimously decided that the appeal brought by an institution that wishes to stay anonymous (Appellant \u201cA\u201d) against the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is inadmissible.

Building on the Issues paper on shared resilience solutions for pandemics published in July, EIOPA analyses options relating to prevention measures to reduce losses, capital markets risk transfer, and multi-peril solutions for systemic risk. It also addresses the general challenges related to modelling and triggers for claims in the context of pandemics. EIOPA emphasizes that a key element of shared resilience solutions is prevention. By promoting prevention measures, insurers can improve society\u2019s capacity to reduce losses. Improving clarity on the scope of coverage as well as integrating prevention measures in risk-based pricing of the insurance cover can contribute to showing the true cost and create incentives for preventive behaviour. Prevention can be supported by regulatory incentives, as well as by public-private initiatives for sharing data. Aligning public-private measures for risk prevention can help in reducing moral hazard and improve the insurability of the risk.\u00a0 To improve society\u2019s capacity for bearing business interruption risk beyond traditional insurance mechanisms, capital markets can be an additional layer of risk transfer and diversification. Designing new and successful capital markets instruments for financing business interruption risk in a pandemic crisis pose challenges, and require legal certainty, predictability and swiftness in the payment of claims.

Going forward, European supervisors expect an increase in credit, market and underwriting risks over the next 12 months, reflecting concerns over second lockdowns due to new waves of the pandemic as well as potential cliff effects once fiscal support measures will be over. With regards to macro risk, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth forecasts, amid upward revisions, show the strongest expected decline in the last quarter of 2020 and the first recovery in the second quarter of 2021. However, potential cliff effects have to be considered in the future. The registered unemployment rate remained at the very high level in September. The 10 year swap rates decreased reaching new lows. Fiscal balance deteriorated as a consequence of the supporting fiscal packages by governments. Financial markets positively reacted to the Covid-19 vaccine news in the second half of 2020 with market and credit risk indicators stabilising. The potential disconnect between market performance and the economic outlook remains a concern, as it could result in sharp valuation adjustments.

The disclosure should take the form of a statement showing how investments adversely impact indicators in relation to\u00a0 \u00a0climate and environment; and social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery aspects. The ESAs have updated the list of indicators for principal adverse impacts.

The amendments are needed to assign mappings for two newly established ECAIs and to reflect the outcomes of a monitoring exercise on the adequacy of existing mappings, namely changes to the Credit Quality Steps (CQS) allocation for two ECAIs and the introduction of new credit rating scales for nine ECAIs. The Implementing Regulations are part of the EU Single Rulebook for banking and insurance aimed at creating a safe and sound regulatory framework consistently applicable across the European Union (EU). The consultation runs until 5 March 2021. In the Implementing Regulations on the mapping of ECAIs, adopted by the European Commission on 11 October 2016, the three ESAs specified an approach that establishes the correspondence between credit ratings and the credit quality steps defined in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and in the Solvency II Directive. The ESAs are now consulting on an amendment to the Implementing Regulation to reflect the establishment of two additional ECAIs and the outcome of a monitoring exercise on the adequacy of the mappings, based on a quantitative and qualitative assessment. In particular, the ESAs are proposing to change the CQS allocation for two ECAIs, together with the introduction of new credit rating scales for nine ECAIs. The ESAs also published individual draft mapping reports illustrating how the methodology was applied to produce the amended mappings in line with the CRR mandate. Consultation process Comments to the Consultation Paper on the mapping under Article 136 of the CRR can be sent by clicking on the \"send your comments\" button on the EBA's consultation page.

Legal basis and background The proposed revised draft ITSs have been developed according to Article 136 (1) and (3) of Regulation 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation) and of Article 109 (a) of Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II Directive), which state that revised draft ITS\u00a0 shall be submitted by the ESAs, where necessary. This change follows a second amendment to the Implementing Regulations, which was proposed by the ESAs in May 2019 and adopted by the European Commission on 29 November 2019. The first amendment reflected the withdrawal of the registration of one CRA and the recognition of five additional CRAs since the adoption of the Implementing Regulations in October 2016. The second amendment, on the other hand, reflected the outcomes of a monitoring exercise on the adequacy of existing mappings, namely changes to the Credit Quality Steps (CQS) allocation for two ECAIs and the introduction of new credit rating scales for ten ECAIs. Two ECAIs, Creditreform and ACRA Europe, have not consented to the publication of their mapping reports. In the absence of a consent, the ESAs published only the outcome of the revision, i.e. the relevant mappings in Annex III of the draft amended ITS (\u201cMapping tables\u201d) together with two documents listing the applicable credit rating scales and credit rating types for each of the concerned ECAI.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/content/esas-consult-amend-technical-standards-mapping-of-ecais-credit-assessments"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0082", "date": "2021-01-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Consumer Trends Report: Business continuity ensured, but a number of issues emerging from COVID-19", "text": "The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published today its Consumer Trends Report with a risk heat-map\u00a0 providing a snapshot of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the insurance and pension sector from a consumer protection perspective as of 30 June 2020.\u00a0 Despite initial concerns, insurers and pension funds have\u00a0 maintained business continuity. Buying products, submitting claims and complaints, or seeking information have carried on broadly as normal \u2014 though in new forms as digitalisation trends have accelerated. When consumers may have found themselves in breach of contractual obligations because of the forced changes in habits and behaviours, insurers have shown forbearance. While the full extent of the effects of COVID-19 on consumer trends is still to be revealed, EIOPA identified a number of key issues emerging from this initial crisis phase: Existing concerns in relation to unit-linked products have intensified. Structural problems linked to the features of some of these products, such as high and complex\u00a0 costs, or unusual or complex risk profiles, can be exposed by early surrenders as consumer\u2019s face unexpected needs for liquidity. Expected lower returns and market volatility can also further intensify these problems.\u00a0 Approaches to exclusions varied across markets, products and undertakings. In some markets, insurers systematically have excluded pandemics from their contracts, while in others the consumer faces uncertainty over the coverage for different products. The crisis highlighted a lack of clarity in terms and conditions, and the complexity or ambiguity of contracts. In some instances court interventions have been required. Many insurers have not been proactive in communicating in a clear and timely way on this issue. Problems for travel insurance products surfaced, both in relation to exclusions but also in relation to changes in the risk profile for which the products were sold, as well as lack of remedial measures to address resulting consumer detriment. However, many travel insurers have also taken goodwill measures and extended coverage particularly to consumers stranded abroad. For some products the risk profile being covered decreased materially, raising questions as to their capacity to meet the needs of the target market, yet initiatives for addressing such changes in risk profile were not widely spread. Heat-map-consumer-trends-report COVID-19 has also taken its toll on the pension sector. In particular, cases of lower pension contributions emerged where savers were not able to continue contributions, due for instance to business shrinking or due to unemployment. Further risks in the decumulation phase may crystalise, with the potential to lead to future cuts in benefits. To alleviate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the insurance and pension sectors, whilst ensuring fair treatment of consumers, national supervisory authorities as well as the insurance and pensions sectors have taken specific measures. As the crisis continues to unfold with potential impacts on profitability,\u00a0 conduct risks can be expected to continue to crystallise and emerge. It is therefore of great importance that concerns regarding financial exclusion, contract clarity, and unit-linked products are adequately addressed and mitigated.

In its Discussion Paper, EIOPA explores questions on whether and how far insurance value chains should be \u2018opened\u2019 up by the sharing of insurance-related and specific policyholder data amongst insurance and non-insurance firms, to protect policyholder rights and to allow for innovation in products and services. The main areas of the consultation paper include: open insurance definition and use cases risks and benefits of open insurance regulatory barriers possible areas to consider for a sound open insurance framework Initial analysis indicates that the exchange of both personal and non-personal data through (open) Application Programming Interfaces has started to emerge in the insurance sector. This can facilitate industry-wide innovation and increase the agility of businesses in responding to changes in customer needs and expectations. However, it could also give rise to new or amplified risks such as data security, cyber risks, interoperability challenges, and liability, ethical and broader consumer protection issues. Increased data sharing, especially if combined with artificial intelligence or machine learning tools could also increase financial exclusion. A key consideration for possible open insurance solutions is finding a balance between regulatory objectives related to data protection, insurance, and competition while supporting innovation, efficiency, consumer protection and financial stability. To find such a balance, EIOPA believes a broad multi-stakeholder discussion is needed. Stakeholders are strongly encouraged to provide views to the Discussion Paper by filling out the EU Survey Tool by 28 April 2021.

The objective of the capital add-on measure is ensure that the regulatory capital requirements reflect the risk profile of the undertaking or of the group. Therefore, it is important that it is used by national competent authorities (NCAs) when needed and it is also important to ensure a high degree of supervisory convergence. This analysis included in the report is based on 2019 year-end data collected under Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II) as reported by the undertakings and insurance groups and complemented by a survey that entailed both qualitative and quantitative questions. During 2019, nine NCAs have set capital add-ons to 19 solo undertakings, out of 2816 (re)insurance undertakings under the scope of the Solvency II Directive in the European Economic Area and the UK. These include nine non-life undertakings, five life undertakings, one composite undertaking and four reinsurance undertakings.

The amount of capital add-ons imposed on undertakings using the standard formula remains very low overall in 2019, accounting for less than 0.5% of the total Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR).

In addition, potential cliff-edge effects could materialise once the fiscal measures supporting economies will fade out. The depth of the recession, its duration and the pace of recovery hinge on how resilient firms and households are to this difficult situation, but most of all on the concrete expectation that effective vaccines are within reach. The impact on insurers\u2019 underwriting and overall profitability will take some time to unfold in parallel with the deterioration of the macroeconomic environment. However, positive vaccine developments and the potential alleviation of the geopolitical tensions increase the prospects that 2021 might be a year when the economies will start to recover. European insurers have been able to withstand the dramatic situation as, in particular, the Solvency II regime helped them to better align capital to risk, build-up resilience and enhance their risk management practices. While risks surrounding the economic growth outlook remain high, they appear to have become less pronounced and there are the first signs that the near term impacts on insurers\u2019 financial position could be captured within the Solvency II confidence levels. Nonetheless, uncertainty remains high and it is key that insurers act to preserve their capital positions in balance with the protection of policyholders and beneficiaries. In this respect, EIOPA strongly recommends insurers to maintain extreme caution and prudence within their capital management. Any dividend distributions, share buy-backs or variable remunerations should not exceed thresholds of prudency and institutions should ensure that the resulting reduction in the quantity or quality of their own funds remains at levels appropriate to the current levels of risk. Supervisory authorities should ensure that insurers' assessment of the overall solvency needs is forward-looking, takes due account of the current level of uncertainty on the depth, magnitude and duration of the impacts of Covid-19 in financial markets and on the economy and the repercussions of that uncertainty in their business models and solvency, liquidity and financial position.

The roundtable brought together representatives from civil society, consumer protection, industry, academia and legal and advisory services for discussions covering a number of topics. EIOPA stressed the importance for insurers and pension funds to manage sustainability risks as part of their risk management, as well as to contribute to reducing risks to sustainability for society. Integrating sustainability considerations may require adjustments in product design as well as regulation and supervision. A particular challenge lies in ensuring proportionate approaches, as evidenced by the complexity and breadth of regulatory initiatives on sustainable finance disclosure requirements.\u00a0 Better risk assessment will allow industry, regulators and society to identify opportunities brought by sustainability challenges, and EIOPA\u2019s analyses of the insurance protection gap for natural catastrophes and transition risks aim to contribute to this.

EIOPA\u2019s approach has been \u201cevolution not revolution\u201d. The measures proposed aim at keeping the regime fit for purpose by introducing a balanced update of the regulatory framework, reflecting better the economic situation and completing the missing elements from the regulatory toolbox. From a prudential perspective, EIOPA is of the view that, overall, the Solvency II framework is working well and no fundamental changes are needed at this point in time but a number of adjustments are required to ensure that the regulatory framework continues as a well-functioning risk-based regime. The proposals from EIOPA include the following: Adjustments to the treatment of interest rate risk, reflecting the steep fall of interest rates experienced during the last years and the existence of negative interest rates. EIOPA also recommends changes to the interest rate curves used by insurers to value liabilities, specifically in respect of the method of extrapolating risk-free rates to better reflect market reality. Improvements to the volatility adjustment to better align the design to its objectives, increase its effectiveness in curbing short-term volatility and in particular rewarding insurers for holding illiquid liabilities. Refinements to the calculation of the risk margin of insurance liabilities, recognising diversification over time, thereby reducing its volatility and size, in particular for long-term liabilities. Revise the criteria for the ability to hold equity long-term, by making a link with long-term illiquid liabilities with the aim to better reflect risks and further encourage long term investments in a sound and prudent way. EIOPA also recommends to introduce a new process for applying and supervising the principle of proportionality. Clear risk-based quantitative criteria are proposed to identify low risk undertakings eligible for applying proportionality measures. These will capture not only the size but also the nature and complexity of the different risks and will provide legal certainty regarding the application of the proportionality principle. The undertakings complying with such criteria will be able, after a notification, to apply automatically a number of proportionality measures. These measures focus mainly on the system of governance and reporting. For example, the submission of the Regular Supervisory Report every three years will be the default approach for low risk profile undertakings.\u00a0 Further proposals relate to cross-border business, in particular to support efficient exchange of information among national supervisory authorities during the process of authorisation and in case of material changes in cross-border activities. The Opinion also reflects the need to supplement the current micro prudential framework with a macro-prudential perspective, including the introduction of specific tools and measures to equip supervisors with sufficient powers to address all sources of systemic risk. Finally, EIOPA also proposes the establishment of a minimum harmonised and comprehensive recovery and resolution framework and the introduction of a European network of national Insurance Guarantee Schemes that should meet a minimum set of harmonised features with the primary aim to protect policyholders, paying compensation when needed or ensuring the continuation of insurance policies. This extensive Opinion is a result of almost two-years of work by EIOPA, including a public consultation and a holistic impact assessment. During this time, EIOPA closely consulted with a wide range of stakeholders. Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA, said: \u201cEIOPA\u2019s Opinion on the 2020 Solvency II review achieves all the defined objectives: adapts the regime to the new interest rate market reality; creates conditions for more long-term investment; brings a paradigm shift on the application of proportionality; and completes the European insurance framework with a macro-dimension and proposals on recovery and resolution and insurance guarantee schemes. Most importantly, these adjustments will ensure that Solvency II will continue to be a credible and fit for purpose regime, capable of protecting policyholders and contributing to market stability even in stress situations.\u201c Discover the opinion", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/solvency-ii-review-balanced-update-challenging-times"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0097", "date": "2020-12-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA updates representative portfolios to calculate volatility adjustments to the Solvency II risk-free interest rate term structures for 2021", "text": "Today, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published updated representative portfolios that will be used for calculation of the volatility adjustments (VA) to the relevant risk-free interest rate term structures for Solvency II.

The report explores current holdings of corporate bonds and equity that can be related to key climate-policy relevant sectors such as fossil fuel extraction, carbon\u2010intensive industries, vehicle production and the power sector. It also quantifies potential climate-change related transition risks and presents insights into possible impacts on these investments as economies transition away from fossil fuel-dependent energy production and carbon-intensive production.\u00a0 While the report represents an initial assessment, intended to inform future work in this relatively new field, the results still illustrate that losses on equity investments in the high\u2010carbon sector can be high, in particular driven by investments in fossil fuel extraction, especially oil and gas. While the overall impact on the balance sheets of the insurance sector is counter\u2010balanced both by investments in renewable energy and the fact that insurers\u2019 portfolios are generally well diversified, EIOPA is working with national supervisors and expects insurers to follow up on the risks identified. \u201cSustainable finance will remain a strategic area for EIOPA in coming years. The role of (re)insurers in addressing climate change is more important than ever. EIOPA expects the industry to manage and mitigate sustainability risks and adopt a sustainable approach to their investments based on principles of stewardship. This will not only support the insurance sector, but also contribute to making sure the financial sector plays a positive role in combatting climate change by channelling funds to more sustainable initiatives\u201d said Gabriel Bernardino, EIOPA\u2019s Chairman. Research related to climate-change and the role of the financial sector is constantly evolving. A set of methodological choices were employed in the preparation of this report, and it is important to note that other approaches exist that might be equally suitable, or complementary to the ones considered in this report.

The discussion paper highlights challenges associated with current non-life underwriting practices and options to ensure the availability and affordability of insurance products, in the context of climate change. Non-life undertakings tend not to include climate-related risks in their pricing methodology, because the short-term nature of non-life contracts allows them to re-price annually. However, given that climate-related losses are expected to grow meaning premiums would likely increase, there is the risk that insurance coverage becomes unaffordable or unavailable to policyholders. The insurance sector can address this potential protection gap not only by transferring and pooling risk, but also by implementing the concept of impact underwriting. (Re)insurers can contribute to climate adaptation and mitigation by incentivising policyholders to mitigate insured risks via risk-based pricing and contractual terms, and consider in their underwriting strategy measures that contribute to climate change adaptation or mitigation.

In the past, only 35% of the total losses caused by extreme weather and climate-related events across Europe were insured. Losses to properties and businesses are expected to grow due to climate change. In response to increasing climate-related risk, the price of insurance will also increase.

Similar to previous years' analysis, this year's results show that most of the measures are widely used. 651 (re)insurance undertakings in 21 countries with a European market share of 80 % use at least one of the following voluntary measures:\u00a0 The matching adjustment The volatility adjustment The transitional measures on the risk-free interest rates The transitional measures on technical provisions\u00a0 The duration-based equity risk sub-module The volatility adjustment and the transitional measure on technical provisions are particularly widely used. The volatility adjustment is applied by 651 undertakings in 21 countries to mitigate the effect of exaggerations of bonds spreads. \u00a0The transitional measure on technical provisions is applied by 136 undertakings in 11 countries with respect to contracts concluded before the start of Solvency II in order to ensure a smooth transition to the new regime. The average Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) ratio of undertakings using the voluntary measures is\u00a0 247 % and would drop to 204 % if the measures were not applied. This confirms the importance of these measures for the financial position of (re)insurance undertakings. Consistent with the trends observed in the last years, availability of long-term guarantee products is mainly stable or decreasing across EEA. In the 2019 report, approximately half of the jurisdictions observed a reduction in the availability of traditional life insurance products with long-term guarantees and an increase in the availability of unit-linked business.

The frequency and severity of natural catastrophes is expected to increase due to climate change. Improved climate projections provide evidence that weather extremes such as heat waves, heavy precipitation, droughts, top wind speeds and storm surges will rise in many European regions. To ensure the financial resilience of (re)insurers covering natural catastrophes, the solvency capital requirements for natural catastrophe underwriting risk need to remain appropriate in light of climate change.\u00a0 In line with that, EIOPA proposes different methodological steps and process changes to integrate climate change in the calculation of natural catastrophe risk and invites all interested stakeholders to provide comments by 26 February 2021. Fill in the survey EIOPA will consider the feedback received and expects to publish the final report in the summer of 2021 together with a feedback statement on the consultation responses of stakeholders.

EIOPA is committed to supporting the European insurance and occupational pension sectors in their transition to climate neutrality and to deliver on the \u2018Green Deal\u2019 initiated by the European Commission.\u00a0 EIOPA\u2019s work on sustainable finance is driven by three objectives: (i) insurers should manage and mitigate ESG risks, (ii) insurers and pension funds should reflect policyholders and pension scheme members\u2019 preferences for sustainable investments and (iii) insurers and pension funds should adopt a sustainable approach to their investments based on principles of stewardship. This reflects the important role insurers and pension funds can play in enabling climate change mitigation and adaption. A key element to foster sustainable growth and to channel funding in economic activities enabling and contributing to environmental, social and governance-related objectives, is to improve data availability and therewith the public disclosure of relevant metrics by reporting entities as well as improving transparency on risks arising from climate change.\u00a0 Join our Sustainable Finance Roundtable on 16 December 2020 and be part of discussion about EIOPA\u2019s ongoing consultation on the scenario analysis in ORSA, activities on disclosure and non-financial reporting, impact underwriting, protection gap for natural catastrophes and sensitivity analysis for transition risk.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-launches-discussion-paper-methodology-integrating-climate-change-standard-formula"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0108", "date": "2020-11-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA consults on insurers\u2019 key performance indicators on sustainability for non-financial reporting", "text": "The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) started today a consultation on the relevant ratios to be mandatorily disclosed by insurers and reinsurers falling within the scope of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive as well as on the methodologies to build those ratios.

ESMA has also published a final report with new draft RTS proposing to amend the three Commission Delegated Regulations \u00a0on the clearing obligation under EMIR. Intragroup transactions The amendments included in these draft RTS propose to extend the temporary exemption for 18 months for intragroup transactions. The bilateral margin Delegated Regulation and the clearing obligation Delegated Regulations originally introduced temporary exemptions for intragroup transactions with third-country group entities to facilitate centralised risk management-procedures for groups, while the relevant equivalence decisions are being assessed. Equity options The amendments included in the draft RTS on bilateral margin propose to extend the temporary exemption for single-stock equity options or index options (equity options) for three years. The bilateral margin Delegated Regulation originally introduced a temporary exemption for equity options so as to facilitate international regulatory convergence with regard to risk-management procedures. The new draft RTS for intragroup transactions and equity options are proposing to extend the abovementioned temporary exemptions to avoid undue costs and an unlevel playing field situation for EU counterparties.\u00a0 Novations from UK counterparties to EU counterparties In the context of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the ESAs and other EU authorities and institutions have highlighted the importance for market participants to be prepared for the end of the transition period. These draft RTS reintroduce a regulatory solution to support these preparations. The draft RTS allow UK counterparties to be replaced with EU counterparties without triggering the bilateral margin and clearing obligation requirements under certain conditions. This limited exemption would ensure a level playing field between EU counterparties and the preservation of the regulatory and economic conditions under which the contracts were originally entered into. Counterparties should start negotiating as soon as possible the novation of their transactions which are in the scope of these amending regulations, given the twelve month timeframe to benefit from this measure. Next steps The ESAs have developed the draft RTS on bilateral margining under Article 11(15) of EMIR, while ESMA has developed the draft RTS on the clearing obligation under Article 5(2) of EMIR. The ESAs have now submitted this new version of the draft RTS on bilateral margin to the Commission for endorsement in the form of a Commission Delegated Regulation, i.e. a legally binding instrument applicable in all Member States of the European Union.

The results show that the risk exposures of the European Union insurance sector slightly reduced, compared to July risk assessment. Insurers are particularly exposed to very high levels of macro risk, while market, credit, profitability and solvency risks decreased to medium level. However, the risk assessment does not account for the outbreak of the second wave of the pandemic. With regard to macro risk, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth forecasts at the end of September show the strongest expected decline in the last quarter of 2020 and first recovery in the second quarter of 2021. The effects of the new wave of the pandemic might skew further downward GDP growth. The unemployment rate remained at the very high level in July. The 10 year swap rates indicator decreased reaching new lows. Inflation remains at a low levels and a decrease is forecasted for the next three quarters. The stabilization of the financial markets at the end of the third quarter 2020 partially eased the challenging situation for European insurers: market and credit risk indicators have stabilised at the end of September 2020. The price gap between stocks and the economic outlook remain a concern, as it could result in sharp valuation adjustments. The credit worthiness of the assets in insurers\u2019 portfolios is under close monitoring. The outlook of those risk categories reflects information available until the third quarter 2020.\u00a0 Profitability and solvency risks, decreased to medium level. SCR ratio for groups slightly improved from the first to second quarter of 2020, amid remaining at lower levels than in the last quarter of 2019. All half-year profitability indicators, which now include the first months of the COVID-19 crisis and their impact on financial returns, show the expected signs of deteriorations.\u00a0 Insurance risks remain at medium level, driven by general concerns over decrease in premium growth, and in some Member States over reserve adequacy. More specifically, year-on-year premium growth for life reported a significant deterioration for the second consecutive quarter, indicating already a negative impact from the COVID-19 outbreak.\u00a0 While market perceptions exhibit a decreasing trend, they are still at medium level. Since June 2020, stocks of life and non-life insurance outperformed relative to the market.

Insurance manufacturers and distributors should take into account their business model, product complexity, and characteristics of the target market in their policies and processes.

In EIOPA\u2019s view, it is essential to foster a forward-looking management of climate change-related risks by insurers, also in the long term, and to enhance supervisory convergence across Europe. The draft Opinion sets out EIOPA\u2019s expectations to national competent authorities on how to supervise the integration of climate change scenarios by insurers in their ORSA, applying a risk-based and proportionate approach. In particular, supervisors should expect insurers to subject material climate change risks to at least two long-term climate scenarios, where appropriate: A climate change risk scenario where the global temperature increase remains below 2\u00b0C, preferably no more than 1.5\u00b0C, in line with the EU commitments; and A climate change risk scenario where the global temperature increase exceeds 2\u00b0C. The Opinion also provides practical guidance on the selection and implementation of scenarios. The consultation is a follow-up to last year\u2019s Opinion on Sustainability within Solvency II, which recommended that (re)insurers consider climate risks beyond the one-year time horizon through the system of governance, risk-management system and their ORSA.

The objective of the study is threefold: to gain an overview of the current approaches in the market and, on best effort basis, analyse and compare the levels of diversification to facilitate a better understanding of modelling dependencies, aggregation and resulting diversification benefits and to enhance quality and convergence of supervision on diversification in internal models. Diversification effects depend on a variety of factors, such as the level of correlations, tail dependencies, number of risk factors, shape of underlying distributions and the dependency structures. These factors may operate at different levels which increases the complexity. The study will therefore be carried out in two phases to balance complexity and completeness. The first phase of the study, starting early October 2020, focusses on top-level risk dependencies between market, credit, life, non-life, health, and operational risks. To complete the understanding of diversification effects, in combination to the respective risk profiles, the lower level inter risk dependencies will also be assessed in the second quarter of 2021 in the second phase of the study. Undertakings using an internal model are expected to take part in this study, which comprises a quantitative and qualitative questionnaire. For undertakings applying the exact same correlation settings and aggregation structure as the standard formula, the first phase is limited to a subset of the qualitative questionnaire.

It particularly points to economic and market uncertainty as a key \u00a0challenge going forward. The impact of the crisis on EU banks\u2019 asset quality is a key concern as significant uncertainty about the timing and size of a recovery persists.

Directly following the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe, the ESAs\u2019 actions provided for regulatory flexibility, fostered operational resilience, and highlighed the importance of consumer protection. In light of ongoing uncertainties on the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory and supervisory cooperation between the ESAs, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and the European Commission remains key. In particular, the ESAs highlighted the need to implement the following policy actions: monitor risks and perform stress testing: risks to valuation, liquidity, credit and solvency have increased across financial sectors. The use and adequacy of liquidity management tools in the investment fund sector should be continuously monitored; foster flexibility where and when needed: supervisors and banks are encouraged to make use of the flexibility in the existing regulatory framework, including use of capital and liquidity buffers to absorb losses; support to the real economy: capital relief should be used in support of continued lending to the real economy in the downturn; stay prepared: EU financial institutions need to be well-prepared for any disruptions they and their clients may face at the end of the UK\u2019s transition period of leaving the EU; supervise digital transformation: it is key for financial institutions and their service providers to carefully manage their ICT and security risks, including when outsourcing ICT activities.

The pandemics continued to cause disruptions in all financial sectors and economic activities. Insurers are particularly exposed to very high levels of macro risk, while market, credit, profitability and solvency risks are at high level. With regard to macro risk, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth as well as inflation forecasts have been revised significantly downwards for all geographical areas. The unemployment rate increased following a steep fall of business activities. Fiscal balances are expected to deteriorate. As a response to the crisis, the governments announced their interventions to sustain the halted economies.\u00a0 Credit risk remains at high level, as the risk of credit events persist elevated going forward. \u00a0Profitability and solvency risks remain at high level. Following the COVID-19 impact, the expected deterioration is already reflected in asset over liabilities and in weakening of Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) ratios for groups and non-life undertakings. A further drop of SCR ratios for both life and non-life undertakings is expected for the next quarter, with the depreciation of assets in the context of COVID-19 as well as effects of already pre-existing low yield environment. The net combined ratio improved for non-life insurance undertakings. \u00a0 Insurance risks decreased to medium level. On one hand, year-on-year premium growth for life undertakings significantly declined indicating already a negative impact from the COVID-19 outbreak. On the other hand, year-on-year premium growth for non-life undertakings and loss ratio show a slight improvement. Catastrophe loss ratio continues increasing following the significant events occurred during 2019 and 2020.\u00a0 Market perceptions remained stable at medium level. Stocks of life and non-life insurance undertakings continued to underperform relative to the market, which in contrast experienced an unexpected increase. Insurers\u2019 Credit Default Swaps (CDS) spreads returned to lower level, with insurers\u2019 external outlooks showing a net increase in negative revision as of June 2020. Background This Risk Dashboard based on Solvency II data summarises the main risks and vulnerabilities in the European Union insurance sector through a set of risk indicators of the first quarter of 2020. This data is based on financial stability and prudential reporting collected from 81 insurance groups and 2488 solo insurance undertakings. Despite the fact that some indicators used in this Risk Dashboard do not still completely capture the latest development in the context of Covid-19 outbreak, the expected deterioration of the relevant indicators reflecting all available information in a forward looking perspective has been considered in the assigned risk levels where possible.

EIOPA\u2019s proposed legal instruments follow the objective to unlock the potential of the European personal pension market by setting the right incentives for the creation of future PEPPs, as portable, simple and cost-efficient products. The regulatory provisions include clear and enforceable quality criteria for PEPP to be followed by providers and so to ensure that European consumers will be offered high-quality, safe, transparent and simple PEPPs. At the same time, EIOPA is leaving sufficient room for innovation and competition to reach good pension outcomes. Clear criteria for sound and robust investment strategies and risk mitigation techniques will help in delivering better long-term returns to savers and in managing investment risks to match the European citizen\u2019s risk appetite. In this regard, EIOPA developed two mandatory consumer information documents: the PEPP Key Information Document (PEPP KID) and PEPP Benefit Statement. These standardised information documents will provide consumers with relevant information allowing for easier decision-making before entering into a binding contract and monitoring the savings\u2019 performance during the life of the contract. The PEPP consumer information documents introduce a holistic approach for the assessment and analysis of the PEPPs\u2019 risk-reward profiles, with a 'summary risk indicator' in the PEPP KID that identifies the riskiness of the different PEPP investment options \u2013 as well as comparative information to understand the relative risk to the expected future PEPP retirement benefits. Further, projections of future retirement income are key for consumers to understand the characteristics of PEPPs and to enable the consumer to consider whether the product meets the individual retirement objectives.\u00a0 Furthermore, online distribution will be one of the most important opportunities of PEPPs to attract the consumer\u2019s interest and to engage with the PEPP saver for the retirement planning. It will be particularly critical that consumers can easily access, understand and use the information presented in a digital format. The use of digital means is expected to bring important cost-efficiencies in the distribution process. Cost-efficiency is also one of the major goals for the success of the PEPP. In case of the Basic PEPP the annual cost will be limited to 1% of the PEPP saver\u2019s accumulated capital at the end of each year. The Basic PEPP \u2013 the core or default investment option \u2013 has been specifically regulated to offer a relatively high level of capital protection, which can be further extended to a capital guarantee. The cost of providing that guarantee is excluded from the cost cap but must be expressly disclosed. Finally, the success of PEPP will depend on strong supervision and close cooperation between national competent authorities in the different Member States. EIOPA is of the view that regular supervisory reporting and solid product intervention powers will be necessary to ensure efficient and effective supervision and monitoring of the PEPP market, both at national and European level. In developing its proposals, EIOPA built on the expertise of the supervisory community of both the insurance and pension sectors, as well as of the other European Supervisory Authorities, the European Central Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. At the same time, EIOPA conducted an active dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders, including EIOPA\u2019s Expert Practitioner Panel on PEPP and its two stakeholder groups, the Insurance and Reinsurance Stakeholder Group and the Occupational Pensions Stakeholder Group. Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA, said: \u2018With the delivery of EIOPA\u2019s proposed implementing measures specifying the PEPP Regulation, EIOPA has fulfilled its objective to design the PEPP as a simple, safe and reliable retirement savings option for the European citizens and to provide a powerful tool to close the pension savings gap. PEPP is a unique opportunity to offer consumers the participation in sustainable investments and the European Capital Market Union, whilst ensuring good pension outcomes and protection against downside market risk.' Notes for Editors PEPP is a voluntary product, intended to offer consumers an additional option to save for retirement, complementing existing public and occupational pension systems, as well as national private pension schemes.\u00a0The Key Information Document (KID) sets out the main information about the PEPP and its investment options. It is highly standardised to enable full comparability amongst PEPPs to provide relevant information to prospective PEPP savers. PEPP Benefit Statement will enable the PEPP savers to easily track and monitor the development of own PEPP savings. Whilst the PEPP Benefit Statement is by its nature personalised, its consistency with pre-contractual information and on-going comparability amongst PEPPs benefits the PEPP savers by enabling them to take informed decisions on potentially changing the investment option, switching the provider or adapting the contribution levels to achieve the PEPP saver\u2019s retirement objective.\u00a0 Infographics Pan-European Personal Pension Product: Save for your pension anywhere in Europe EIOPA's proposed level 2 regulations for the PEPP\u00a0 EIOPA\u2019s proposal PEPP proposed legal instruments and technical advice: Regulatory Technical Standards Technical advice on supervisory reporting Technical advice on criteria for EIOPA\u2019s product intervention powers Implementing Technical Standards PEPP other documents of the proposal: - \u00a0\u00a0 PEPP Impact assessment -\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Report on consumer testing of PEPP information documents -\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Description of EIOPA's stochastic model used for PEPP \u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Letter from EIOPA to EC", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-finalises-regulation-of-pan-european-personal-pension-product"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0138", "date": "2020-07-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA launches its Solvency II Single Rulebook", "text": "Today the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) launched its first Single Rulebook.

During the last months, the Covid-19 outbreak further proved the importance of the Solvency II regulatory framework. The market-consistent and risk based approach helped insurers to better align capital to risk, build-up resilience and enhance the risk management practices, while the adjustments included for long-term guarantees allowed to partially mitigate market volatility caused by COVID-19. \u00a0As of year-end 2019 the insurance sector had a solid and comfortable capital buffer (median SCR ratio of 213%) which helped insurers to withstand the initial severe market shocks experienced with the Covid-19 crisis. However, a high level of uncertainty on the magnitude of economic disruption increases downside risks going forward. The COVID-19 has further intensified the preexisiting challenges posed by the prolonged low yield environment, a fundamental risk for both insurance and pension sectors. Moreover, the shock has also increased credit risk, challenging the asset side valuations of insurers and their solvency positions. There is also a significant concern that the forthcoming recession will negatively affect corporate sector profitability, resulting in rating downgrades, increased defaults and unemployment. Finally, a high interconnectedness of insurers with banks could further support spill-overs of mentioned risks from the real sector to insurers and pension funds. Strains to demand and insurers\u2019 underwriting profitability might take some time to unfold in parallel with the deterioration of the macroeconomic environment. In addition, some insurers run the risk of becoming involved in lengthy and costly legal battles in relation to claims occurred as a consequence of the lock down measures. Finally, confinement measures resulted in working from home arrangements, which in turn increased cyber risk and further highlighted the importance of a reliable cyber risk insurance market. All these factors might lead to materialisation of the risks on insurers\u2019 balance sheet with a substantial lag and high uncertainties. In the reinsurance sector, catastrophe activity in 2019 was benign with global insured losses below the average of the last ten years, supporting the increase of 22 percentage points to 240%, in the solvency ratio as compared to the last quarter of 2018. Investment and underwriting profitability remained broadly unchanged in 2019, but considerable pressure is expected from Covid-19 shock. Finally, the COVID-19 crisis has also taken its toll on the financial situation of the European occupational pension fund sector. Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision may be subject to funding and liquidity concerns due to suspended or lowered contributions from sponsors and members. Sponsoring undertakings in heavily affected sectors by the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to be in significant financial distress putting members of such pension funds at risk of unemployment in the near future. Sponsoring undertakings\u2019 financial difficulties to maintain contributions, or in the worst case, sponsoring undertaking\u2019 insolvency may test national pension protection schemes. Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA said: \u2018There is no doubt that the economy will experience a deep and unprecedented recession. The high uncertainty on the recovery path needs to be captured by an appropriate forward-looking risk assessment. In this respect, different recovery scenarios should be captured in the design of next year\u2019s European Union-wide insurance stress test\u2019.

The paper recognises that private insurance solutions alone will not be sufficient to protect society against the financial consequences of future pandemics. Solutions will require both public and private sector involvement, and build on the following four key elements: Proper risk assessment Risk prevention and adaptation measures Appropriate product design Risk transfer The options include different insurance models and coverage, for example whether cover should be mandatory, and whether payouts should be based on a pre-agreed parameter or index. The options also include different ways the public and private sectors could work together, for example establishing an EU-expert group for data sharing and risk modelling, and creating a platform for public and private coordination on prevention measures. Different potential roles are considered for how the European Union can contribute towards solutions. As a next step, the scope of the shared resilience framework could be expanded to consider further resilience gaps stemming from systemic cyber, climate change impacts in natural catastrophes and terrorism. In developing this paper, EIOPA consulted the insurance and reinsurance industry, as well as commercial insurance buyers and insurance brokers and distributors. Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA, said: \u2018It is of the utmost importance not only to have a debate about how our society can better react to future disruptive events such as Covid19 but also to come up with a way forward. While it is clear that insurance cannot cover the full costs of pandemics, insurers and reinsurers should be part of the solution and not part of the problem. Furthermore, I strongly believe that shared resilience solutions can play an important role in mitigating economic fragmentation throughout the European Union and should be part of the recovery efforts towards a European Union that protects its businesses and its citizens.

The ultra-low interest rate environment remains a key concern for the insurance market. It constitutes one of the most important sources of systemic risk for insurers for the future. In addition to the low interest rate environment, the COVID-19 outbreak has severely affected macroeconomic and market conditions worldwide, increasing the likelihood of a \u201clow for long\u201d scenario with adverse implications for the insurance sector. As a result, insurers are significantly challenged in terms of asset allocations, profitability, solvency and business model adaptation. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting central banks\u2019 response measures to alleviate the impact on the economic activity, will contribute to the continuation of the low interest rate environment. While European insurers were on average well capitalised at the end of 2019, ultra-low interest rates affect the sector through the balance sheet channel both on the assets and liabilities side, but also through the income channel. Considering that market yields are at very low levels, this might have an impact on insurers\u2019 profitability in the medium to long-term horizon.\u00a0 The COVID-19 crisis has amplified these risks by increasing market uncertainty and risk premia. The combined impact of lower yields and increased market uncertainty has led supervisory authorities across Europe to take measures, allowing for flexibility and unburdening of the industry, at the same time providing guidance and calling for prudence.

It is vitally important that insurance companies place the fair treatment of customers at the heart of their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Insurance manufacturers are asked to identify products whose main features, risk coverage or guarantees have been materially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. If such products no longer offer value to the target market, insurers should assess whether there is the risk of possible unfair treatment. The assessment should be on a medium to longer term basis, to take into account product lifecycles and the evolution of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Where there is a possibility of unfair treatment, EIOPA expects remedial measures to be taken. These measures should be proportionate to potential unfair treatment and take account of legal requirements in national civil and insurance law. In taking remedial measures, insurance manufacturers should aim at both mitigating the situation and preventing further occurrences of detriment. Insurance manufacturers should consider a broad range of possible measures and their impact on products over the medium to long term. This call to action is one of a series of measures that EIOPA has been taking to address the impact of COVID-19 on the insurance sector and in particular builds on its statement of 1 April 2020 calling on insurers and intermediaries to take steps to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on consumers. EIOPA and national supervisory authorities will continue to work collectively to ensure financial stability, market integrity and consumer protection, including by monitoring market practices in light of the COVID-19 situation.

In its response EIOPA highlights that a sound approach to financial innovation should strike a balance between enhancing financial innovation and ensuring well-functioning consumer protection and financial stability frameworks. A level playing field and technological neutrality are crucial. \u00a0 In particular, EIOPA considers that further improvements can be achieved in the following areas: Insurance regulation must be fit for purpose. For this reason, it is crucial to understand how new technologies and business models drive new risks and opportunities. Improvements and clarifications can be introduced, e.g. on paper requirements by default, on the definition of insurance, and on outsourcing requirements.\u00a0 There must be a fair, ethical and transparent use of data. Data is a key driver of financial innovations such as those enabled by artificial intelligence. Data analytics governance frameworks are crucial to engender trust and ground the use of data in common ethical principles. This is an area where stakeholders have called for more guidance, so EIOPA is working with an Expert Group on Digital Ethics in insurance, drawn from a wide range of stakeholders, to bring further clarity on fairness, explainability, and governance aspects of artificial intelligence and similar use cases. Access to relevant datasets is critical for insurance. In this context EIOPA underlines: Open Finance/Open Insurance: EIOPA has recently started a broader discussion with stakeholders on possible balanced, forward-looking and secure approaches to Open Insurance and its risks and benefits to the insurance industry, consumers and supervisors. This work is currently on-going, and so preliminary views on potential risks and benefits should be treated cautiously. However, EIOPA sees some potential for the sector if handled sensitively. Internet of Things data: EIOPA encourages the European Commission to promote the interoperability of applications and portability of data between different platforms (i.e. reduce lock-in effects), and to improve the power of consumers to switch between providers.\u00a0 Cyber incident reporting data: a common incident reporting framework is critical for sharing knowledge about incidents and to encourage the development and growth of sound underwriting practices.\u00a0 Data standardisation: EIOPA believes it is critical that future standardisation is built on what has already been achieved. EIOPA has extensive experience in this regard and is ready to be closely involved in future discussions on data standardisation.

A key area of work in 2019 focused on proposing amendments to Solvency II in the context of the 2020 Review of Solvency II as a result of the identification of inconsistencies in the implementation of some areas of Solvency II. This knowledge lead in some cases to proposals to amend the legislative framework while in others it allowed for the identification of areas where further work is needed from a supervisory convergence perspective. Both approaches should contribute in the future to ensuring a more consistent application of the framework. Also in the context of Solvency II, EIOPA published a Supervisory Statement on the application of the proportionality principle in the supervision of the Solvency Capital Requirement. To promote a common supervisory culture, as a result of findings from a thematic review on consumer protection issues in travel insurance, EIOPA issued a warning\u00a0 to insurers and insurance intermediaries to tackle high commissions for travel insurance products as a supervisory response. To minimise risks to the internal market and level playing field, EIOPA took important steps on the use of product intervention products, with market monitoring of consumer trends highlighting areas where conduct risks are emerging or continue to persist. In addition, peer reviews continued as a valuable tool to identify areas for convergence in supervisory practice, as well as good practices. In 2019, EOPA conducted a peer review on the Regular Supervisory Report. In the area of supervision of emerging risks, EIOPA concluded a thematic review on the use of Big Data analytics in motor and health insurance and carried out a public consultation on draft Guidelines on information and communication technology security and governance. Throughout the year, EIOPA continued its oversight activities with active participation in 53 cross-border colleges, cooperation of cooperation platforms focused on undertakings operating cross-border and bilateral engagement with national supervisors. EIOPA also strengthened its oversight activity on conduct of business, initiating bilateral visits to National Competent Authorities.

EIOPA significantly strengthened its work on conduct of business supervision. EIOPA also conducted thorough market monitoring activities. A thematic review on the use Big Data analytics in motor and health insurance lead to the establishment of a consultative expert group to assist EIOPA in the development of digital responsibility principles for the insurance sector. In addition, a thematic review on consumer protection issues in travel insurance resulted in a warning in to insurers and insurance intermediaries to tackle high commissions for travel insurance products In the context of the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD), EIOPA worked on a number of deliverables, including an examination of general good rules and the review of the Decision on the cooperation of competent authorities. EIOPA also undertook considerable work as part of 2020 Review of Solvency II to ensure that the landmark regulation remains fit for purpose. In the context of the implementation of the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provisions \u2013 IORP II Directive, EIOPA focused its work on achieving proportional and relevant application of IORP II throughout Europe. Implementation of the supervisory convergence plan, with priority given to the application of proportionality, the supervision of internal models and the supervision of cross-border business, which resulted in continued use of cross-border platforms to address Following political agreement on the proposal for a Pan-European Personal Pension Product (PEPP), EIOPA began work on a number of specific PEPP technical deliverables. During the course of the year, EIOPA continued to build a consistent approach to supervision and promote consistent supervisory practices through the implementation of its supervisory convergence plan, with priority given to proportionality, the supervision of internal models and the supervision of cross-border business. EIOPA continued to identify trends and potential risks and vulnerabilities that could have an adverse effect on the pension and insurance sectors across Europe. As part of this work, throughout the course of this year, EIOPA published insurance and occupational pension statistics, the risk dashboard and financial stability reports. A key challenge continues to be the prolonged low yield environment. In 2019, EIOPA also conducted a stress test on the occupational pensions sector. For the first time, the stress test included an assessment of environmental, social and governance exposures. In addition, EIOPA also continued its work on cross-cutting themes of sustainable finance and InsurTech, digitalisation and cyber resilience, including a further investigation into the cyber insurance market in Europe. Looking ahead, EIOPA will continue to deliver on its mission. Taking into consideration the post-Coronavirus environment, EIOPA will\u00a0 continue to focus on consumer protection and the financial stability of the insurance and pensions sector, in particular so that the sector remains resilient, fair and able to rebound.

Technology continues to evolve, bringing new opportunities, social change and new expectations for consumers. In response, insurance undertakings and intermediaries continue to develop and revise their business models, often in increased co-operation with third parties (e.g. BigTech companies and start-ups), bringing both beneficial innovation and a new set of emerging risks that have to be taken into account. These changes in firms\u2019 reliance on outsourcing and third parties bring potential benefits and opportunities. They are expected to transform the way products and services are provided with benefits for consumers (in terms of products and services that are better targeted to consumers\u2019 needs, of a better quality or that are more cost-effective) and insurance undertakings (for instance in terms of more efficient processes and decision-making or better fraud detection and management of risks). However, it may also create new conduct and prudential risks and amplify or relocate significantly old risks (e.g. operational risk, Information and Communication Technology risks, security, governance, and reputational risks, consumer protection). It can also lead to legal and compliance issues (e.g. data protection and compliance with outsourcing rules and regulatory perimeter issues). The widespread use of third party providers can also lead to concentration risk if a large number of undertakings become dependent on a small number of dominant outsourced or third party service providers. In this context, a possible fragmentation of the insurance value chain could occur, including, most pertinently, a potential for a reduced regulatory and supervisory \u2018grip\u2019 on the relevant activities in the value chain, or ways in which the \u2018lengthening\u2019 of the value chain \u2018stresses\u2019 existing regulatory and supervisory oversight.\u00a0 The goal of the public consultation is therefore to get a better picture on possible fragmentation of the European Union\u2019s insurance value chain and supervisory challenges related to that in order to plan for next steps.

Despite the fact that some indicators used in this Risk Dashboard do not capture the latest market development in the context of Covid-19 outbreak, the expected deterioration of the relevant indicators reflecting all available information in a forward looking perspective has been considered in the assigned risk levels. This addresses the current situation of high uncertainty in the insurance market. The results show that the risk exposures of the European Union insurance sector increased as the outbreak of Covid-19 strongly affected the lives of all European citizens with disruptions in all financial sectors and economic activities. Macro and market risks indicators deteriorated in March 2020, moving from high to very high level. The macroeconomic environment has been affected strongly by the global lockdown. GDP estimate points to a strong downturn for the first quarter 2020 and latest forecasts predict a recession worldwide for 2020. Inflation forecasts have been revised downwards for the next four quarters. Monetary policy support has been activated by all major central banks. Financial markets have been characterized by sell-off across asset classes, increased volatilities for bond and equity markets, increasing risk premia and flight to quality investment behaviour in March 2020. Credit risk has increased across all asset classes, in particular CDS of government bonds, financial and non-financial corporate bonds have increased sharply. Liquidity and funding risks have been raised to high level due to potential additional strains on the disposable liquidity of insurers in the medium to long-term horizon. For Q4-2019 liquidity indicators were broadly stable, however some are expected to worsen, triggered by possible decrease in premiums and new business, potential increase in claims and illiquid level of certain assets. Profitability and solvency risks have increased to high level. Although for Q4-2019 insurers solvency positions remained relatively stable, looking ahead profitability and solvency risks are expected to deteriorate, given the double-hit scenario negatively affecting insurers on both asset and liability side. Insurance risks also raised to high level. While broadly stable in Q4-2019, negative effects via income reduction and increase in claims are expected going forward. Market perceptions remain at medium level albeit deteriorating. The EU insurance sector underperformed the market, both life and non-life businesses lines, and the median price-to-earnings ratio of insurance groups in the sample decreased since the last assessment. Insurers\u2019 external ratings and rating outlooks do not show sign of deterioration as of end March 2020, however credit quality is expected to deteriorate. Background This Risk Dashboard based on Solvency II data summarises the main risks and vulnerabilities in the European Union insurance sector through a set of risk indicators of the fourth quarter of 2019 complemented with market data and other available information.

The ESAs have intensified their coordination with national competent authorities (NCAs), as well as with relevant authorities from other jurisdictions in order to ensure adequate regulatory actions where needed during this crisis. In this context, these amending draft RTS were developed to facilitate further an internationally coordinated approach on how to adapt the implementation of the bilateral margin requirements. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) announced on 3 April\u00a0 their agreement to defer by one year, the deadline for completing the final two implementation phases of the bilateral margin requirements, in order to provide additional operational capacity for counterparties to respond to the immediate impact of COVID-19. The ESAs draft RTS present the changes to the Delegated Regulation on bilateral margining to incorporate in the EU regulatory framework the one-year deferral agreed by the BCBS and IOSCO. These changes would result in covered counterparties with an aggregate average notional amount of non-centrally cleared derivatives above \u20ac50 billion becoming subject to the requirement to exchange initial margin from 1 September 2021, while covered counterparties with an aggregate average notional amount of non-centrally cleared derivatives above \u20ac8 billion becoming subject to the requirement from 1 September 2022. Legal basis and next steps The ESAs have developed the RTS under Article 11(15) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (EMIR). A first version (ESAs 2019 20) of these draft RTS had been submitted to the Commission and published on the websites of the ESAs on 5 December 2019. This first version dealt with the treatment of physically settled FX forward and swap contracts, intragroup contracts, equity option contracts and the implementation of the initial margin requirements. However, in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the Final Report and the draft RTS have now been updated to take into account the agreement from the BCBS and IOSCO to defer by one year the deadline for completing the final two implementation phases of the bilateral margin requirements. This updated version of the Final Report on the draft RTS on bilateral margining thus replaces entirely the version submitted to the Commission in December 2019. The ESAs have now submitted this second version of the draft RTS to the Commission for endorsement in the form of a Commission Delegated Regulation, i.e. a legally binding instrument applicable in all Member States of the European Union. Following the endorsement, they are then subject to non-objection by the European Parliament and the Council.

Profit participation products continue having lower costs than unit-linked products Ongoing costs continue being the most prominent cost component, representing 80% of total unit-linked costs and 70% of total costs of profit participation products Higher risk products, have higher variability of net returns but on average they show higher net returns. Similarly average costs increase with the level of riskiness of the product. \tThe\u00a0European Insurance and Occupations Pensions Authority (EIOPA),\u00a0has today published its second report on cost and past performance of insurance-based investments products (IBIPs)\u00a0and personal pension products (PPPs)\u00a0in the European Union. The report is published following a request from the European Commission to the European Supervisory Authorities to periodically report on the costs and past performance of retail investment products. This report provides an analysis of costs for 2018 and past performance for the period 2014-2018. The study documents the impact of market volatility on returns for different product types. A comparison with last year\u2019s analysis \u2013 where unit-linked products clearly outperformed profit participation products \u2013 shows how, given their nature, unit-linked products can offer high returns but also pose risks for consumers during periods of poor market returns.\u00a0\u00a0 Overall, performance in 2018 was the lowest for five years. Negative net returns in 2018 for unit-linked insurance products, hybrid insurance products and personal pension products similar to unit-linked insurance products has resulted in, on average, returns of 0% or close to 0% for the reporting period (2014-2018). On the contrary, because of their smoothing of market shocks for consumers, while also reporting low returns for 2018, profit participation insurance products had a positive net return (2.3%) for the reporting period. Returns for unit-linked insurance products and personal pension products similar to unit-linked insurance products were negative across all Member States in 2018. Profit participation insurance and personal pension products similar to profit participation show milder differences amongst Member States in terms of return trends. Higher risk products, measured in terms of risk-class, have higher variability of net returns but on average they show higher net returns. The study also found that costs continue to have a significant impact on net returns, confirming a trend observed last year. On average, profit participation products have lower costs than unit-linked products in reduction in yield\u00a0 terms, accounting for 1.6% versus 2.3% Ongoing costs continue being the most prominent cost component, representing 80% of total unit-linked costs and 70% of total costs of profit participation products. Entry costs are higher for profit participation products. Exit-costs are minor for both types of products. An analysis classifying costs according to their nature/cause, for both IBIPs categories shows that administrative costs are the most prominent cost item, followed by distribution costs.

Insurers and intermediaries are asked to: Provide clear and timely information to consumers on contractual rights; Treat consumers fairly and be explicit in all communications; Inform consumers about contingency measures taken; Continue applying product oversight and governance requirements and, where necessary, carry out a product review; and Consider the interests of consumers and exercise flexibility in how they are treated, where reasonable and practicable. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) has issued today a statement to insurers and intermediaries, urging them to take steps to mitigate the impact of Coronavirus/COVID-19 on consumers. While the unprecedented disruption caused by the outbreak has focused insurers\u2019 attention on ensuring business continuity, it is important that consumers continue to be treated fairly. Consumers still rely on insurance during this difficult time and it is essential that insurers continue to provide access to and continuity of service. EIOPA welcomes initiatives already taken by insurers and intermediaries in recognition of the particular circumstances that consumers find themselves and which may prevent consumers from fulfilling contractual obligations. Nevertheless, unfair treatment of consumers as a result of disruption to the market is a risk to the entire sector. With this statement, EIOPA specifically asks insurers and intermediaries to consider a number of different actions, taking into account developments relating to the Coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak. These include: Providing clear and timely information to consumers; Keeping consumers informed about contingency measures that have been put in place; Continuing to apply product oversight and governance requirements; and Exercising flexibility in the treatment of consumers where reasonable and practical. Whilst highlighting the need for flexibility in the interest of consumers and for their continued fair treatment, EIOPA also highlights that imposing retroactive coverage of claims not envisaged within contracts could create material solvency risks and ultimately threaten policyholder protection. EIOPA and national supervisory authorities (NSAs) are working collectively to ensure financial stability, market integrity and consumer protection during this time of disruption.

It is increasingly clear that the outbreak is having significant consequences for the global economy, including financial services. Insurers are likely to face progressively difficult conditions in the immediate future, both in terms of navigating challenging market conditions and in maintaining operations, while taking steps to protect employees and customers. Key messages Business continuity 1. It is particularly important that insurers are able to maintain the services to their clients. In this sense, insurance companies should be ready to implement the necessary measures to ensure business continuity. 2. In order to offer operational relief in reaction to coronavirus, national competent authorities (NCAs) should be flexible regarding the timing of supervisory reporting and public disclosure regarding end 2019. EIOPA will coordinate the specifics of the approach. 3. Furthermore, in the short term, EIOPA will limit its requests of information and the consultations to the industry to essential elements needed to assess and monitor the impact of the current situation in the market. 4. EIOPA is extending the deadline of the Holistic Impact Assessment for the 2020 Solvency II Review by two months, to 1 June 2020. In the coming days, EIOPA will communicate details on postponing additional reporting and information requirements. Solvency and capital position 5. Under Solvency II, EU insurance companies are required to hold sufficient eligible own funds on an on-going basis to cover their Solvency Capital Requirement. The risk-based Solvency Capital Requirement enables insurance undertakings to absorb significant losses and give confidence to policyholders and beneficiaries that payments will be made as they fall due. 6. Furthermore, the Solvency II framework includes a ladder of supervisory intervention between the Solvency Capital Requirement and the Minimum Capital Requirement, which is the minimum level of security below which a company\u2019s financial resources should not fall. This allows for flexibility in cases of extreme situations, including measures to extend the recovery period of affected insurers, for example, as foreseen by Article 138 of the Solvency II Directive. 7. Moreover, recent stress tests have shown that the sector is well capitalised and able to withhold severe but plausible shocks to the system. 8. The Solvency II framework also includes a number of tools that can be used to mitigate risks and impacts to the sector. EIOPA and the NCAs stand ready to implement these tools, if and when necessary, in a coordinated manner, to ensure that policyholders remain protected and financial stability is safeguarded. 9. Nevertheless, insurance companies should take measures to preserve their capital position in balance with the protection of the insured, following prudent dividend and other distribution policies, including variable remuneration. 10. Notwithstanding existing tools and powers, and together with national authorities and the other ESAs and the ESRB, EIOPA will continue to monitor the situation and will take or propose to EU institutions any measure necessary in order to mitigate the impact of market volatility to the stability of the insurance sector in Europe and safeguard the protection of policyholders.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-statement-actions-mitigate-impact-of-coronaviruscovid-19-eu-insurance-sector"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0189", "date": "2020-03-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Coronavirus: Staff measures", "text": "From 16 March, staff from the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority will be teleworking.

Since then, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) has embarked on a journey to develop a comprehensive, group-wide supervisory and regulatory framework for Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs), including a quantitative Insurance Capital Standard (ICS). The journey to get where we are has been long. A marathon rather than a sprint. Nonetheless a major milestone was achieved on November 2019 with the agreement of the so-called ICS version 2.0., a consolidated group-wide reference standard with a globally comparable risk-based measure of capital adequacy for IAIGs. From a European perspective the successful implementation of Solvency II and its proper fine-tuning and review is our biggest priority and in parallel we remain as strongly committed as ever to the next stages of the ICS journey.\u00a0 We will continue to work with our international peers from all continents in order to ensure that the final ICS standard is based on a market-adjusted valuation, that capital requirements are sufficiently robust and risk-sensitive, and that internal models are allowed to be used under sound and prudent criteria. Our vision is that in those circumstances European legislators should be confortable to endorse the ICS and make any necessary adjustments to Solvency II to ensure that European IAIGs are required to use only one capital framework that meets international standards. From an EIOPA standpoint the main objective of this journey continues to be the setting up of one single risk-based ICS that would promote a level playing field between IAIGs headquartered in different parts of the world, reducing arbitrage opportunities and supporting financial stability. This objective is not easy to achieve because many different valuation methods and capital standards are currently used by different jurisdictions to assess group capital adequacy. Nevertheless, the progress made in the latest years, namely the agreement on the ICS 2.0, shows that this convergence process is unstoppable. While recognizing that only the future implementation of the ICS throughout the world will bring the necessary convergence to the supervision of IAIGs, conceptually, it could be possible to imagine a situation where a different capital calculation methodology would deliver substantially the same outcomes as the ICS. The recognition of this comparability could help the path towards convergence. It is in this spirit that EIOPA approaches the assessment of comparable outcomes of the Aggregate Method (AM) currently under development by the United States supervisors. The assessment needs to be based on data showing that the AM and the ICS produce similar results over time and under different economic and market conditions over the business cycle, and that they trigger similar supervisory action on group capital adequacy grounds. Above all, the AM cannot be less prudent than the ICS. The information collected during the five years monitoring period together with the economic impact assessment will by and large determine the final design of the ICS and the factual basis for the assessment of comparability. It is extremely important to collect data from different business models in order to ensure a proper calibration and risk sensitiveness of the ICS and gather sufficient evidence to perform the comparability assessment. The monitoring period is therefore a crucial part of the journey of building an ICS and insurance groups throughout the world should engage and participate. EIOPA strongly encourages all IAIGs, and, in particular, the European ones, to participate in this common effort and continue to contribute to shape the ICS. International standards are the best response to fragmentation and that is particularly relevant in businesses like insurance and reinsurance that heavily rely on scale and diversification. To develop an international standard is a hard task and requires patience, strong commitment and leadership. That\u2019s what EIOPA expects from the leaders of all European supervisors and all European IAIGs. In the race towards an ICS we can all be winners. But one thing is for sure, the ones that don\u2019t participate in the race can\u2019t win it.

This environment is significantly impacting the insurance sector in the EU, in terms of asset allocation, reinvestment risk, profitability and solvency. It constitutes one of the most important sources of systemic risk for insurers for the coming years. This statement is addressed to the supervisory community and the insurance industry. Its aim is raising awareness and ensuring that the insurance sector continues to be financially resilient. It also seeks to inform consumers and policyholders about supervisory measures and actions taken to protect their interest. EIOPA encourages national supervisory authorities (NSAs) and undertakings in the EU to continue taking actions to mitigate the impact of the ultra-low/negative interest rate environment on the EU insurance sector. In the short-term, EIOPA recommends that: NSAs should intensify the monitoring and supervision of insurers identified as facing greater exposure to the low interest rate environment; NSAs should engage into a dialogue with undertakings to explore actions they could take to improve their financial resilience; Within the context of improving financial resilience and in particular sound capital planning, undertakings should exercise caution in distributing dividends and NSAs should consider whether it is necessary to restrict the distribution of dividends; NSA and undertakings should pay special attention on pre-emptive recovery and resolution planning to reduce the likelihood and impact of insurance failures; and NSAs should broaden the analysis of the low interest rate environment and also consider the potential build-up of systemic risk. In the medium- to long-term, NSAs should identify whether there are any tools or powers missing in their current toolkit. Where a gap is identified, NSAs should request the missing powers.

The low yield environment remains the key risk for both the insurance and pension fund sector and continues to put pressure on solvency positions. While the European insurance sector remains overall well capitalized with a median Solvency ratio of 212%, significant disparities remain across undertakings and countries. Overall solvency positions have also deteriorated in the first half of 2019 and the low interest rate environment is expected to put further pressures on the capital positions going forward, in particular for life business. The low yield environment also has implications for long-term profitability, as it becomes increasingly difficult to meet promises and guarantees issued in the past. This could trigger further search for yield behaviour by insurers and pension funds, which could add to the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial sector if not managed properly. Moreover, a combination of weakening economic outlook, concerns over debt sustainability and stretched valuations across financial markets could give rise to a sudden reassessment of risk, in particular for riskier assets, which could trigger losses in the investment porfolios of insurers and pension funds. EIOPA will therefore continue to monitor closely this risk to identify at an early stage any potential vulnerabilities. Furthermore, cyber risk and climate change risks continue to demand attention from insurers, pension funds and supervisors, as insurers and pension funds are increasingly susceptible to cyber risks as the digital transformation continues, while also bringing new opportunities for insurers in the form of cyber underwriting. Regarding climate risk, insurers and pension funds can play a key role in the transition towards a low carbon economy as major institutional investors, but this transformation carries significant investment risks as well. It is therefore crucial that both insurers and pension funds actively incorporate climate change risks in their own risk management frameworks. At the same time, climate change can also have a significant impact on the liabilities of non-life insurers and reinsurers, as extreme weather related events become more frequent and severe. EIOPA has taken several initiatives to pro-actively tackle the climate challenge, by analysing potential climate-sensitive exposures in insurance investment portfolios, while the stress test for IORPs in 2019 also included an assessment of potential transition risks for pension funds. \u00a0Furthermore, EIOPA published an Opinion on integrating sustainability and climate change risks into the Solvency II framework in September 2019. Going forward, EIOPA will continue to build on this work to assess both physical and transition risks for insurers and pension funds and assess potential misalignment with the Paris agreement climate goals. The reinsurance industry has seen a relatively benign first half of 2019 in terms of catastrophic events, with global insurance losses significantly below long-term levels and the record losses observed in 2017 and 2018. Coupled with the overall positive stock market developments, this has benefited the profitability and solvency position of the reinsurance sector, although losses in the second of half of the year could still have significant impact. Growth in global reinsurance capital has been supported mostly by traditional capital, although outstanding alternative reinsurance capital has also continued to grow despite concerns related to the potential effect of climate change on the occurrence of natural disasters. The issuance of new ILS instruments appears to be more moderate in 2019 compared to the previous two years however. Finally, the challenging economic environment has also taken its toll on the financial situation of the European occupational pension fund sector. The persistently low interest environment affects the current values of DB pension obligations and in almost all Member States, cover ratios (ratio of assets covering the pension obligations) decreased with the outlook continuing to look challenging in light of the slowdown in the global economy and the pressure on the interest rates. Asset values also impaired significantly towards the end of 2018, wiping off substantial values in equity investments which also affected the accumulated savings of members and beneficiaries in DC funds. Going forward, the improved reporting framework for the IORP sector will allow for an enhancement monitoring and assessment of potential vulnerabilities and financial stability implicatinos of European pension funds.\u00a0 Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA said: \u201cOver the past six months, we have seen the risks for a prolonged low yield environment intensify. A combination of a weakening economic outlook, increased downside risks and ongoing uncertainties about trade disputes and Brexit have ushered in a new round of monetary easing by central banks, which has been accompanied by a sharp decline in longer-term yields. In this regard, we continue to see the clear benefits of Solvency II, as the market-consistent and risk-based regulatory framework has helped price in the risk of low interest rates, build resilience and enhance the risk management practices of insurers. At the same time, it is important that the regulatory framework continues to remain robust in the future and adequately reflects the risks faced by insurers in a low for long environment. As such, it is crucial that these elements are addressed in the currently ongoing Solvency II review to ensure that promises can continue to be met in the future.\" This Financial Stability Report also includes two thematic articles, focusing on i) a climate risk assessment of the sovereign bond portfolio of European insurers and ii) the impact of variation margining on EU insurers' liquidity.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-outlines-key-financial-stability-risks-of-european-insurance-and-pensions-sector-0"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0209", "date": "2019-12-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA identifies areas where risks for consumers remain high", "text": "Transparency and disclosure of information to consumers has overall improved \u00a0 The digitalisation of the insurance sector continues showing potential for improving the consumer experience and brings new opportunities for insurers However, areas that could cause potential consumer detriment continue being reported, with possible risks for consumers across the product lifecycle Particular concerns relate to unit-linked, credit life/credit protection and add-on insurance products as well as claims management in motor insurance\u00a0 The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published, today, its 2019 Consumer Trends Report outlining major developments in the insurance and pensions sectors affecting European consumers.\u00a0 Improvements in disclosure practices have been seen and digitalisation remains a broadly noteworthy trend, showing that financial innovations can bring benefits for both insurers and consumers, so long as they are adequately designed and properly implemented.\u00a0 Accident and health insurance products continue being 'good value-for-money', with the medical expense line of business having the highest claims ratio and the lowest commission rates for non-life insurance products.\u00a0 Conduct issues related to unit-linked, credit life/credit protection insurance and add-on insurance products have become more prevalent. Claims management in motor insurance, in particular in some markets, also remains an area of concern. Unit-linked insurance. Concerns continue on the poor levels of consumer understanding, product complexity, unmitigated conflicts of interests, and poor returns \u2013 sometimes due to unnecessarily high costs. Issues were identified on the sale of unit-linked policies to vulnerable consumer groups.\u00a0 Credit life and credit protection products. These are increasingly under the supervisory scrutiny of NCAs and EIOPA. Even though they can bring significant benefits to consumers, potential for consumer detriment exists given generally high commissions that can lead to unmitigated conflicts of interests and some aggressive sales techniques. A data analysis shows that the ratio of acquisition expenses over gross written premiums, an indicator of commission levels, is high for other life insurance, with 151 insurance undertakings above 30% and 50 above 50%.\u00a0 Add-on insurance. Despite bringing peace of mind to consumers and generally being a low cost product, add-on insurance is also a potential source of consumer detriment across several European markets. Concerns relate to the possible exploitation of behavioural biases in the context of an increase in cross-selling practices and high commissions.\u00a0 Innovations in the motor insurance. These are broadly noteworthy, with an increase in policies being sold through comparison websites and an increasing uptake of telematics. However motor insurance-related complaints, due to claims management issues, continue to be the most prevalent complaints and have increased by 6% at the EEA level. For pensions, with life expectancy increasing, a strain is being put on the decumulation phase. To address this issue, changes and innovations \u2013 such as lifecycling or delayed retirement \u2013 are taking place.\u00a0 Moreover, effective and clear communication with members is essential for them to be aware of both the product's characteristics and their pension situation. Given that more members prefer online and more interactive communication, innovations are taking place across several countries. Publicly or privately run pensions dashboards are also appearing, making it easier for consumers to access information on their overall pension situation. Looking ahead, although regulatory changes that came into force in 2018 (Insurance Distribution Directive and the Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products Regulation) are already showing some positive developments \u2014 mainly in relation to disclosures \u2014 it is anticipated that there will be an increasing focus on product oversight and governance, to ensure that products are adequately designed and targeted, thereby ensuring good consumer outcomes. Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA, said:\u00a0 'Understanding consumer trends is an essential part of our work to identify where customers might suffer because of poor practices or lack of information. Despite evidence of improved disclosures, problems remain with product design and product review processes and undertakings and distributors must take responsibility for improving consumer outcomes. At the same time, where EIOPA identifies areas for concern we will take action. This was the case for certain business models in travel insurance, where EIOPA recently issued a warning.

This is a crucial, biennial exercise to assess the resilience and potential vulnerabilities of the European Defined Benefit (DB) and Defined Contribution (DC) pension sector, tailored to the specificities of the diverse European pension sector and its potential impact on financial stability. For the first time, this European stress test exercise covered the analysis of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors for IORPs. In its 2019 exercise, EIOPA applied an adverse market scenario, characterised by a sudden reassessment of risk premia and shocks to interest rates on short maturities, resulting in increased yields and widening of credit spreads. That adverse market scenario was applied to the end-2018 'baseline' balance sheet of a representative sample of European Economic Area (EEA) IORPs. In the baseline, those IORPs were underfunded by EUR 41 billion on aggregate, which translates into 4% of their liabilities, according to the common methodology. The adverse market scenario would have led to substantial aggregate shortfalls of EUR 180 billion according to national methodologies and EUR 216 billion following the stress test's common methodology. Under the assumptions of the common methodology, the shortfalls in the adverse scenario would have triggered aggregate benefit reductions of EUR 173 billion and sponsoring undertakings would have to provide financial support of EUR 49 billion. In the 2019 exercise, EIOPA employed an extended cash flow analysis, which provided important insights into the stress effects in terms of timing: IORPs' financial situation would be heavily affected in the short term, leading to substantial strains on sponsoring undertakings within a few years after the shock and resulting in potential long-term effects on the retirement income of members and beneficiaries over decades (should the short-term effects become permanent).\u00a0 Assessing the potential conjoint investment behaviours of IORPs after the stress event, EIOPA observed an expected tendency to re-balance to pre-stress investment allocations within 12 months after the shock. That may indicate counter-cyclical aspects of the expected investment behaviour, yet would also come at a risk. The majority of IORPs in the sample indicated having taken appropriate steps to identify sustainability factors and ESG risks for their investment decisions, which is important for an effective implementation of the IORP II Directive, yet only 30% of them have processes in place to manage ESG risks. Further, only 19% of the IORPs in the sample assess the impact of ESG factors on investments' risk and returns. The preparedness of IORPs to integrate sustainability factors is widely dispersed and seems correlated to how advanced national frameworks were.\u00a0 Matching the participating IORPs' investment information with Eurostat's greenhouse gas emission statistics by business sectors, indicates a relatively high carbon footprint, compared to the average EU economy, of the equity investments and, concentrated in a few Member States, of the debt investments.\u00a0 In total, 19 countries participated in the exercise, covering more than 60% of the national DB and 50% of the national DC sectors in terms of assets \u2013 in most countries. In total 176 IORPs participated, thereof 99 DB IORPs and 77 DC IORPs. EIOPA will follow-up on the findings and analyse in more depth the investment behaviour of IORPs, in particular in the persistently ultra-low and negative interest rate environment. To do so, EIOPA will make use of the significantly improved pension reporting from 2020. Going forward, EIOPA wants to further improve its analytical tool set for stress testing IORPs, extending the horizontal approach and with that assessing the common exposures and vulnerabilities of the DB and DC sectors together. \u00a0 Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA, said: 'Long-term obligations and long investment horizons arguably require IORPs to consider ESG factors and enable IORPs to sustain short-term volatility and market downturns for longer periods than other financial institutions. The supervisory monitoring and the applied supervisory tools need to be capable of detecting adverse market trends and market developments that can have long-term negative effects.'", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-publishes-results-of-2019-occupational-pensions-stress-test"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0211", "date": "2019-12-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA updates representative portfolios to calculate volatility adjustments to the Solvency II risk-free interest rate term structures", "text": "Today, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published updated representative portfolios that will be used for calculation of the volatility adjustments (VA) to the relevant risk-free interest rate term structures for Solvency II.

Similar to previous years' analysis, this year's results show that most of the measures are widely used. 699 (re)insurance undertakings in 22 countries with a European market share of 75 % use at least one of the following voluntary measures:\u00a0 The matching adjustment The volatility adjustment The transitional measures on the risk-free interest rates The transitional measures on technical provisions\u00a0 The duration-based equity risk sub-module The volatility adjustment and the transitional measure on technical provisions are particularly widely used. The volatility adjustment is applied by 660 undertakings in 22 countries to mitigate the effect of exaggerations of bonds spreads. \u00a0The transitional measure on technical provisions is applied by 159 undertakings in 11 countries with respect to contracts concluded before the start of Solvency II in order to ensure a smooth transition to the new regime. The average Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) ratio of undertakings using the voluntary measures is\u00a0 235 % and would drop to 159 % if the measures were not applied. This confirms the importance of these measures for the financial position of (re)insurance undertakings. In addition to the long-term voluntary measures, the report analyses the impact of the extrapolation of risk-free interest rates; for that purpose, an information request to insurance and reinsurance undertakings was carried out by EIOPA. Undertakings assessed the impact of two scenarios to change parameters of the extrapolation. At EUR level, scenario 1 (increase of the last liquid point for the euro from 20 to 30 years) would result in a reduction of the SCR ratio by 31 percentage points and scenario 2 (increase of the last liquid point for the euro from 20 to 50 years) would result in a reduction of the SCR ratio by 52 percentage points.\u00a0 Consistent with the trends observed in the last years, availability of long-term guarantee products is mainly stable or decreasing across EEA. In the 2018 report, approximately half of the jurisdictions observed a reduction in the availability of traditional life insurance products with long-term guarantees and an increase in the availability of unit-linked business.

In its analysis, EIOPA investigated the illiquidity of insurance undertakings from two different perspectives: a total balance-sheet approach with a focus on how undertakings can hold on to their investments and a liability perspective that focuses on the predictability of the timing of the cash flows. On asset management, a key distinction is made between the length of an investment in individual assets and of an investment in an asset class when establishing the holding period of assets.

The objective of the capital add-on measure is ensure that the regulatory capital requirements reflect the risk profile of the undertaking or of the group. Therefore, it is important that it is used by NCAs when needed and it is also important to ensure a high degree of supervisory convergence within the 31 European Economic Area (EEA) countries, including the EU Member States, regarding its use. \u00a0 This analysis is based on 2018 year-end Solvency II data collected under Directive 2009/138/EC as reported by the undertakings and insurance groups complemented by a survey that entailed both qualitative and quantitative questions. During 2018, eight NCAs set capital add-ons to 21 solo undertakings, out of 2819 (re)insurance undertakings under the Solvency II Directive in the EEA. These include 10 non-life undertakings, eight life undertakings, two reinsurers and one composite undertaking. In 2017, six NCAs had set capital add-ons for a total of 23 solo undertakings. Hence, although the number of capital add-ons is extremely low and decreased slightly from 2017 to 2018, two more NCAs made use of this tool in 2018. The amount of capital add-ons imposed on undertakings using the standard formula remains very low overall in 2018 accounting for 1% of the total Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR). However, the amount of capital add-on is not insignificant when considering the amount at individual level. In sum, as of year-end 2018, the weight of the capital add-on increased to 32% (30% in 2017) when looking at the amount of capital add-ons as a percentage of the total SCR for those undertakings using the standard formula with capital add-ons.\u00a0 The distribution of the capital add-ons as a percentage of the total SCR in 2018 for undertakings that imposed capital add-ons varies substantially once more.

The Consultation Paper sets out EIOPA's current stances to approach the regulation of key aspects of the PEPP, underpinning the idea of establishing a simple, safe and cost-efficient savings product. In developing its proposals, EIOPA sought input from the supervisory community of the insurance and pension sectors, the other European Supervisory Authorities, and conducted an active dialogue with EIOPA's stakeholder groups and the Expert Practitioner Panel on PEPP.\u00a0 The resulting key considerations are: PEPP information documents: pre-contractual and annual information on the PEPP and its investment options have to be highly standardised to allow for comparability between PEPPs and for the consumer to track the performance of the chosen PEPP. The information needs to be relevant and tailored to the pension objective of the PEPP. The proposals are built on the experience with packaged retail investment and insurance-based products (PRIIPs) and the Directive on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORP II), yet tailored to the specificities of PEPP, in particular its long-term nature, whilst making the PEPP ready for digitalisation. Cost cap of the Basic PEPP: the cost-efficiency of the Basic PEPP is enforced by the introduction of a cost cap. In line with the PEPP's policy objective, an 'all inclusive' approach is suggested, while ensuring a level playing field amongst providers offering different features and in particular a guarantee on the capital invested. Risk-mitigation techniques: it is necessary to set out the principle objectives for the risk-mitigation techniques to foster investment strategies leading to better pension outcomes. Clear and auditable criteria are needed to ensure the effectiveness of the chosen risk-mitigation technique.\u00a0 Supervisory Reporting and cooperation between NCAs and EIOPA: enabling an efficient functioning of the PEPP market requires close monitoring and effective product supervision both from a home and host perspective - which is only possible with regular information exchange on PEPP business. EIOPA's product intervention powers: relevant criteria, tailored to the PEPP, have been developed, building on past experience with product intervention powers at the level of the ESAs. Stakeholder feedback is necessary to further develop the proposals and to ensure that the regulation delivers on the promise of the PEPP as an effective tool to complement pension savings in Europe. The consultation ends on 02 March 2020.

Broadly speaking, these can be divided into three parts. Firstly, the review of the long term guarantee measures. These measures were always foreseen as being reviewed in 2020, as specified in the Omnibus II Directive. A number of different options are being consulted on, notably on extrapolation and on the volatility adjustment. Secondly, the potential introduction of new regulatory tools in the Solvency II Directive, notably on macro-prudential issues, recovery and resolution, and insurance guarantee schemes. These new regulatory tools are considered thoroughly in the consultation. Thirdly, revisions to the existing Solvency II framework including in relation to freedom of services and establishment; reporting and disclosure; and the solvency capital requirement.\u00a0 In EIOPA's view, the Solvency II framework is overall working well. Therefore the approach here has in general been one of evolution rather than revolution. The principal exceptions arise as a result either of supervisory experience, for example in relation to cross-border business; or of the wider economic context, in particular in relation to interest rate risk. This consultation covers all areas of the call for advice except insurance guarantee schemes and most topics on reporting and disclosure which have been consulted upon at an earlier stage. The main specific considerations and proposals of this consultation are as follows: \u25feConsiderations to choose a later starting point for the extrapolation of risk-free interest rates for the euro or to change the extrapolation method to take into account market information beyond the starting point. Considerations to change the calculation of the volatility adjustment to risk-free interest rates, in particular to address overshooting effects and to reflect the illiquidity of insurance liabilities. The proposal to increase the calibration of the interest rate risk sub-module in line with empirical evidence, in particular the existence of negative interest rates. The proposal is consistent with the technical advice EIOPA provided on the Solvency Capital Requirement standard formula in 2018. The proposal to include macro-prudential tools in the Solvency II Directive. The proposal to establish a minimum harmonised and comprehensive recovery and resolution framework for insurance. In a number of areas, further work is ongoing and stakeholders are invited to contribute to it, in particular on the risk margin, equity risk and property risk. A background document to this consultation paper includes a qualitative assessment of the combined impact of all proposed changes.\u00a0 The information request will be accompanied by information requests to national supervisory authorities and to the industry in order to collect data on the impact of individual proposals included in the consultation. Furthermore, in 2020 EIOPA will collect data in order to assess the quantitative combined impact of the proposals to be included in the advice. EIOPA will finalise its view on the advice in particular on the basis of the consultation feedback and the impact data collected.\u00a0 Beyond the changes on interest rate risk EIOPA aims in general for a balanced impact of the proposals.

With economic recovery, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, coupled with decreasing travel costs, travellers' numbers have been growing each year. This has led to growth in the travel insurance market.\u00a0 Travel insurance is mostly a 'small-ticket' business, but it can be critical for consumers, since the impact of insufficient cover or denied claims \u2013 in particular for medical expenses while travelling \u2013 can be extensive at the individual level. It has been already in the spotlight of supervisors in some European countries given the specific conduct risks it entails, related to conflicts of interest arising from mis-aligned incentives in distribution channels, consumer behaviour issues arising in so-called 'add-on' markets, and consequential risks of poor value at the level of the product offer. Furthermore, stakeholders highlighted in their dialogue with EIOPA issues around coverage, denied claims, unclear and conflicting terms and condition similar to the input gathered by EIOPA in the context of consumer trends reporting. The travel insurance sector is facing important changes with new opportunities but at the same time with heightening existing problems and new risks. Insurance undertakings have been integrating new technologies into their business models leading to changes across the entire value chain, while new kinds of distributors have entered the market. Particular concerns arise with regard to rising commissions, the exploitation of behavioural biases when selling online travel insurance policies, and the potential erosion of product value and features. To understand better travel insurance products, to identify sources potential of conduct risk and consumer detriment and to take possibly required relevant supervisory actions, EIOPA launched this Thematic Review. EIOPA issued a questionnaire to 201 insurance undertakings operating in 29 European countries to collect evidence. The national competent authorities (NCAs) distributed the questionnaire to undertakings representing approximately 60% of the total gross written premiums of the travel insurance line of business in the national market. In addition, EIOPA collected input from industry and consumer associations, as well as its Insurance and Re-Insurance Stakeholder Group. The key findings are:\u00a0 The travel insurance market as a whole does not appear to face a general market failure, and travel insurance products remain valuable for consumers. However, heightened conduct risks leading to consumer detriment due to problematic business models with remuneration structures based on extremely high commission levels carrying.\u00a0 Strong potential of poor value for money for consumers due to some insurers paying extremely high commissions to distributors, in some cases significantly more than 50% of the premium. For example in one case, the insurer paid 5.5 times more in commissions to distributors than consumers received back in claims, with commission level of 77% of the premium paid by consumers. Although the average commissions in travel insurance are around 24% of the gross written premium (GWP). Strong potential of poor value for money for consumers due to very wide variations in claims ratio. Some insurers have claims ratios below 20% of the GWP compared to the average claims ratio of 40% of the GWP regardless of the distribution channel. Increased conduct risks due to new market players entering the market and selling travel insurance products online as an ancillary activity (airline and ferry companies, price comparison websites, aggregators, banks and supermarkets). Potential risks of low quality products and services for consumers due to newly established partnerships with distributors via international tenders. In some cases, these partnerships are based solely on commissions paid to the distributors. High degree of consumer detriment due to the potential high degree of dismissed claims through no pre-contractual medical screening and around 70% of insurers excluding pre-existing medical conditions from the coverage of travel insurance products. Potential increased costs for consumers as in most cases assessment of overlaps in cover only conducted at the claim stage and not already during the sales process. Insurers assess only at the claim stage, which policy will cover the incident and split costs between insurers.\u00a0 Given these findings, EIOPA issued today a \u00a0Warning to the Travel Insurance Industry as a supervisory response on the issues identified by the \u00a0Thematic Review. The issues addressed are in particular those problematic business models with remuneration structures based on extremely high commission levels and the business models that combine high commission with extremely low claims ratios, offering poor value for money to consumers. EIOPA considers that such business models are not consistent with the fundamental regulatory principles set out in Directive (EU) 2016/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2016 on Insurance Distribution (IDD), such as acting in the best interests of the customer and obligations on product oversight and governance.\u00a0 EIOPA expects all market participants to comply fully with the IDD.\u00a0 Notwithstanding that insurance undertakings remain free to set premiums or prices, they should nevertheless assess their product offering and approval process, including their identification of target markets, to ensure that their products offer fair value to customers and are fully capable of meeting the needs of their customers.\u00a0 Insurance undertakings and insurance intermediaries should assess their distribution agreements to ensure that they are able to act always honestly, fairly and professionally in accordance with the best interest of their customers.\u00a0 To ensure better outcomes for consumers in the insurance market, EIOPA and NCAs will closely monitoring how effectively consumers' needs are taken into account in product development and testing as well as during distribution. In this regard, insurance manufacturers and intermediaries should be aware that EIOPA and NCAs will intensify their risk-based supervision of insurance undertakings and insurance intermediaries, notably in the national markets where risks are identified, including monitoring the market for ancillary insurance products.\u00a0 NCAs will, where necessary, exercise their supervisory powers, including investigatory powers and powers to impose sanctions for failures to comply with the conduct of business requirements set out in the IDD, including:\u00a0 The duty to act in the best interest of customers and not to pay or receive remuneration that conflicts with this duty The requirement not to enter into arrangements by way of remuneration, sales targets or otherwise that could provide incentives for the recommendation of a particular insurance product to a customer The obligation to maintain, operate and review the approval process for each insurance product, specifying an identified target market and assessing all relevant risks to that target market Where risks are identified and other supervisory measures are not successful, taking into account the principle of proportionality and in line with national law, NCAs will exercise their powers to impose administrative sanctions and other measures such as:\u00a0 Requiring the insurance distributor to cease the conduct and to desist from a repetition of that conduct As measure of last resort, in the case of an insurance or ancillary insurance intermediary, withdrawal from the national register NCAs will share with EIOPA supervisory measures taken to address the business models highlighted by the Thematic Review.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-identifies-consumer-protection-issues-travel-insurance-and-issues-warning-travel"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0227", "date": "2019-10-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA launches field test on revised and new templates under Solvency II reporting and disclosure review 2020", "text": "The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) launched today - as part of the 2020 Solvency II reporting and disclosure review \u2013 Wave 1 - a field test on the revised and newly proposed templates.

Drawing on data and information provided by national anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) competent authorities (CAs), the ESAs found that the monitoring of transactions and suspicious transactions reporting still raise concerns, particularly in sectors where a financial institution's business model is based on frequent transactions. This Opinion contributes to strengthening the EU's AML and CFT efforts.\u00a0 The ESAs are concerned about weaknesses in the control frameworks put in place by financial institutions, particularly for transaction monitoring and suspicious transactions reporting, in sectors with high volumes of transactions. \u00a0Equally, it appears that the development of adequate business-wide and customer risk assessments is still a challenge for financial institutions across different sectors and is an areas that would benefit from more guidance from CAs.\u00a0 Furthermore, in addition to divergences in the national transposition of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD4), as identified in the first Joint Opinion published in 2017, today's Opinion identifies divergences between certain provisions in the AMLD4 and other EU legal acts, particularly those related to authorisations, fitness and propriety and assessments of qualifying holdings. Some of these concerns have already been addressed through recent revisions in legal frameworks like the Capital Requirements Directive (CRDV).\u00a0 The ESAs acknowledge that the use of new technologies may offer opportunities to better fight financial crime, however, this Opinion also confirms that the increasing use of new technologies by credit and financial institutions may give rise to ML/TF risks if vulnerabilities are not understood and mitigated. Equally, the rapid spread of virtual currencies is also an area of growing concern for the ESAs, as they often give rise to heightened ML/TF risks due to the absence of a common regulatory regime and the anonymity associated with them.\u00a0 To tackle these risks and concerns effectively, the ESAs consider that CAs \u00a0must play a more active role and enhance their engagement with the private sector to develop a better understanding of new technologies, products and services available to credit and financial institutions. CAs should also consider whether they have a sufficient understanding of risks and controls in those sectors where they have carried out only limited assessments and may need to review their supervisory approach. As a complement to this Opinion, the ESAs have developed an interactive tool, which gives European citizens, CAs and credit and financial institutions a snapshot of all ML/TF risks covered in the Joint Opinion.

The Opinion addresses the integration of climate-related risks in Solvency II Pillar I requirements. While Solvency II - as a risk-based, forward-looking and market-consistent framework - is well equipped to accommodate sustainability risks and factors, climate change brings considerable challenges to the valuation of assets and liabilities, underwriting and investment decisions and risk measurement. Climate change increases the uncertainty about the occurrence and the impact of physical or transition risks, which can happen at any time and suddenly, with far-reaching consequences. Hence, undertakings should not be complacent about these risks.\u00a0 (Re)insurance undertakings are called to implement measures linked with climate change-related risks, especially in view of a substantial impact to their business strategy. Consequently, EIOPA stresses the importance of scenario analysis in the undertakings' risk management. To increase the European market and citizens' resilience to climate change, (re)insurers should consider the impact of their underwriting practices on the environment. Consistently with sound actuarial practice, where risk mitigation and loss prevention can make a significant difference, the development of new insurance products, adjustments in the design and pricing of the products and the engagement with public authorities, should be part of the industry's stewardship activity. Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA, said: \u201cEIOPA's overall goal is securing a resilient industry in a sustainable environment for the benefit of consumers. The stewardship role of (re)insurers in contributing to climate change adaptation and mitigation is more important than ever. This Opinion outlines how (re)insurers can contribute to identifying, measuring and managing risks arising from climate change, through their investment and underwriting activities. In the interest of our society and the next generations - before it is too late - immediate actions are needed by all players globally.

The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks, the fast digital transformation and the increased use of big data and cloud computing make insurers increasingly susceptible to cyber threats, in particular considering the amount of confidential policyholder information insurers are possessing. This calls for a sound cyber resilience framework for insurers.\u00a0 On the other hand, the digital economy and the advance of technology offer opportunities to cyber underwriters. Appropriate cyber insurance coverages can make a valuable contribution to manage cyber risk faced by businesses and organisations. A well-developed cyber insurance market can play a key role in enabling the transformation to the digital economy. Insurers play a key role in this transformation: not only are insurers susceptible to cyber threats directly themselves, but they also offer coverage for cyber risk through their underwriting activities. This report analysed cyber risk from both angles based on responses from 41 large (re)insurance groups across 12 European countries with the aim to further enhance the level of understanding of cyber risk for the European insurance sector.\u00a0 The findings confirm the need for a sound cyber resilience framework for insurers and identified the key challenges faced by the cyber underwriters. In particular, clear, comprehensive and common requirements on the governance of cybersecurity as part of operational resilience would help ensure the safe provision of insurance services. This would include a consistent set of definitions and terminology on cyber risks to enable a more structured and focused dialogue between the industry, supervisors and policymakers, which could further enhance the cyber resilience of the insurance sector. Ultimately, further actions to strengthen the resilience of the insurance sector against cyber vulnerabilities are essential, in particular considering the dynamic nature of cyber threats.\u00a0 Regarding the cyber insurance market, the report finds that, although still small in size, the European cyber insurance industry is growing rapidly, with an increase of 72% in 2018 in terms of gross written premium for the insurers surveyed in the report, amounting to EUR 295 million in 2018 compared to EUR 172 million in 2017. However, non-affirmative cyber exposures (where cyber risk is neither explicitly included nor excluded within an insurance policy) remain a source of concern. While common efforts to assess and address non-affirmative cyber risks are under way, some insurers have adopted a 'wait-and-see' approach to address non-affirmative cyber risk, where the implementation of actions plans to address non-affirmative exposure depends on the materialization of future events. Therefore, further effort is needed to tackle properly non-affirmative cyber exposures to address the issue of potential accumulation risk and provide clarity to policyholders.\u00a0 Finally, enhanced data collection on cyber incidents and losses should allow insurers to manage and price their affirmative cyber risk exposures more effectively. Having common and harmonized standards for both cyber risk measurement and cyber incident reporting purposes could greatly facilitate this. To this end, creating a European-wide cyber incident-reporting database, based on a common taxonomy, could be considered. This report is based on the responses of 41 large (re)insurance groups across 12 European countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom.\u00a0 The sample under consideration is very similar to the one of the EIOPA 2018 Insurance Stress Test, representing a market coverage of around 75% of total consolidated assets.\u00a0 The only difference is the non-participation of one group included in the sample for the Stress Test 2018 exercise.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-calls-sound-cyber-resilience-framework"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0232", "date": "2019-09-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA establishes Consultative Expert Group on Digital Ethics in Insurance", "text": "The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) established today its Consultative Expert Group on Digital Ethics in Insurance.

While they are expected to cover different areas of the insurance value chain, specific focus will be given to pricing and underwriting, given their specific importance in the insurance sector. The Consultative Expert Group may also act as a sounding board for EIOPA in other related policy initiatives in the area of InsurTech, for instance by supporting EIOPA in promoting a sound governance framework around the use of BDA tools such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. EIOPA's call for expression of interest of July 2019 resulted in an extraordinary group of high-level experts with a diverse set of experiences and expertise. EIOPA is pleased to confirm the composition of its Consultative Expert Group on Digital Ethics in Insurance. For further details, please refer to the table below.\u00a0 The group will meet for the first time on Tuesday, 8 October.

In light of the ongoing uncertainties, especially those around Brexit, supervisory vigilance and cooperation across all sectors remains key. Therefore, the ESAs call for the following policy actions by European and national competent authorities (NCAs) as well as financial institutions: \u25feContingency planning: Financial institutions and supervisors should continue their work on contingency planning and assurance of business continuity in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Considering the variety of measures undertaken by the ESAs and national supervisory authorities and other competent authorities, the EU financial sector should be well informed and prepared to manage risks from a micro-perspective. The ESA's will also continue to closely monitor ongoing political and market developments and consider the need for further communications on that basis.\u00a0 \u25fe\"Low-for-long\" scenario: Supervisors and financial institutions should continue taking into account a \"low-for-long\" interest rate scenario and associated risks. Low interest rates are an important driver of low bank profitability and remain the main risk for the insurance and pension fund sectors. They contribute to the further build-up of valuation risks in securities markets as well as to a move into less liquid and more leveraged investments through search-for-yield strategies. On the investment fund side, a convergent application of the rules on liquidity management and (for UCITS) eligible assets as well as a consistent use of stress testing will be important supervisory tools. \u25feBank profitability: There is a need to further address unprofitable banks and their business models in order to increase the resilience of institutions to a more challenging economic environment. Further investments into financial technologies and exploring opportunities for bank sector consolidation are among responses to low profitability. Transparency and the consistent application of common prudential requirements and supervisory rules across jurisdictions are preconditions, which could contribute to the use of opportunities cross border consolidation, may offer.\u00a0 \u25feLeveraged lending market: Risks related to the leveraged loan market and Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) in the financial sector should be further explored and identified. There is a lack of clarity about the total volume of leveraged loans outstanding and about the ultimate holders of risks of many CLO tranches. Supervisors have raised concerns about a possible underpricing of risks.\u00a0 \u25feSustainable finance and ESG risks: Supervisory authorities and financial institutions should continue their work on identifying exposures to climate related risks and facilitate access of investors to sustainable assets. Scenario analysis and stress testing are important tools that can be implemented by supervisors with a goal to incorporate sustainability considerations into risk assessment. Financial institutions should incorporate climate risk and other ESG factors into their risk management framework and should play a stewardship role by taking into account the impact of their activities on ESG factors. Going forward, the ESAs should take a proactive stance in fulfilling mandates on sustainable finance, including on how ESG considerations can be incorporated into the regulatory and supervisory framework of EU financial institutions. Background The Joint Committee is the forum for cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs).\u00a0 Through the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering.

The results show that the risk exposures of the European Union insurance sector remain overall stable, with macro and market risks now at a high level.

The low interest rate environment remains a key risk for the insurance sector. Credit risks continue at medium level with broadly stable Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads for government and corporate bonds. Profitability and solvency risks increased due to lower return on investments for life insurers observed in year-end 2018 data.

The remuneration principles set out in Article 275 of the European Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 are high level and leave considerable discretion to the undertakings and supervisory authorities. Therefore, divergent practices have emerged across the European Union.\u00a0 EIOPA's task is to ensure an effective and consistent level of supervision to guarantee a similar level of protection for policyholders and beneficiaries at the European level. Its goal is to build a common supervisory culture through the convergence of national supervisory practice. Therefore, this draft Opinion addressed to national supervisory authorities aims to enhance supervisory convergence by focussing on a set of remuneration principles. It provides guidance on how to challenge the application of the principles and focuses on a reduced scope of staff identified as potential higher profile risk-takers to promote a proportionate approach. The Opinion also identifies benchmarks that should trigger the supervisory dialogue and should not be seen as hard targets for the practical implementation of the remuneration principles.\u00a0 EIOPA's intention is not to add requirements or to create administrative burden. Risk-based supervision of the remuneration policy means that the national supervisory authorities should have a two-dimensional approach when assessing the risk: the first dimension being the undertakings' overall risk profile and the second dimension being the design of the concrete remuneration policy which might be identified as being more risky than others. National supervisory authorities may adopt a proportionate and more flexible approach in the supervision of the remuneration principles when undertakings are categorized as 'low risk'.

EIOPA's main findings - as of 31 May 2019 - are the following: Out of the 28 NCAs, which have implemented the IDD, EIOPA identified two where further steps are necessary to ensure the appropriate publication of the national general good rules Collectively, the quantity and level of diversity of information requirements contained in general good rules, present significant challenges for entities seeking to carry out cross-border business in terms of additional entry costs Some Member States have published general good rules on registration and organisational requirements, which allow the NCAs of the host Member States to impose additional requirements on incoming insurance distributors where within the IDD those rules are under the competence of the home Member State. This approach is detrimental to the proper functioning of the IDD and the Single Market. The principle under the IDD is that the \"single registration\" in the home Member State triggers the provision of the European Union passport to the insurance distributor subject to the appropriate notification procedures To address the issues, EIOPA's follow-up actions include: Issuing recommendations on an individual basis to NCAs how the information on general good rules should be published to enable passporting insurance distributors to easily access and understand such information Consulting external stakeholders to collect feedback to findings and suggestions presented in this report and any general good provisions which they consider to be disproportionate with regard to consumer protection and have an adverse impact on cross-border business activities Analysing further from a legal and supervisory perspective the general good rules imposed on incoming insurance distributors in areas of the home Member State competence such as registration and organisational requirements and, where appropriate, making use of the tools at EIOPA's disposal under its Founding Regulation The Report analysing national General Good rules including the Annex with a country-by-country analysis can be obtained via EIOPA's website. EIOPA invites all interested stakeholders to fill in an online survey on the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) \u2013 Report analysing national General Good rules by 22 September 2019.\u00a0 Background Article 11(5), IDD provides that \"EIOPA shall examine in a report, and inform the Commission about, the 'general good' rules published by Member States as referred to in this Article in the context of the proper functioning of this Directive and of the internal market\". General good rules are provisions, which are part of the legal system of the host Member State. Neither the IDD, nor any other European legislation entail a precise definition of what general good rules consist of. The concept of general good has evolved through Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case-law and only applies in non-harmonised fields. In its Interpretative Communication of 2000, the European Commission reviewed the requirements developed by the CJEU, which a national provision has to satisfy, if it is to validly obstruct or limit the exercise of the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-examines-national-general-good-rules"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0239", "date": "2019-07-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA publishes Discussion Paper on Methodological Principles of Insurance Stress Testing", "text": "The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published today a Discussion Paper on Methodological Principles of Insurance Stress Testing.

This consultation is a draft response to the Call for Advice of the European Commission of 11 February 2019 on the part linked with insurance guarantee schemes.\u00a0 EIOPA is of the view that every Member State should have a national guarantee scheme in place for the protection of policyholders in the event of a failure of an insurer, which should meet a minimum set of harmonised features. Therefore, EIOPA's calls for the establishment of a European network of national insurance guarantee schemes, which are sufficiently harmonised and adequately funded. At the same time, it is essential to take properly into account the proportionality principle to avoid excessive burdens on insurers and Member States. In this context, a flexible approach as regards the legal structure and set-up of the schemes is important.\u00a0 The draft Advice addresses the following areas of an insurance guarantee scheme (IGS):\u00a0 The role and functioning: The IGS should be set up with the primary aim to protect policyholders, such as to pay compensation swiftly to policyholders for their losses in case an insurer becomes insolvent and/or to ensure the continuation of insurance policies The geographical coverage: The IGS should be harmonised in accordance with the home-country principle The eligible policies: The IGS should cover a specific range of life and non-life policies, such as policies where the failure of an insurer could lead to considerable financial or social hardship for policyholders and/or in case of lines of business with a high market share in cross-border business in Europe The eligible claimants: The IGS should cover natural persons as well as micro- and small-sized legal entities The coverage level: The IGS should have a harmonised minimum coverage level\u00a0 The funding: The IGS should have adequate funding systems in place. The IGS should for instance be funded on an ex-ante basis and if needed complemented by ex-post funding\u00a0 Disclosure: There should be requirements for adequate, clear and comprehensive disclosure about the IGS protection to consumers and policyholders\u00a0 Cross-border cooperation and coordination: Respective arrangements between national IGSs should be in place Furthermore, EIOPA advices to conduct a review of at least every five years after a harmonised framework becomes effective.\u00a0 Stakeholders are invited to provide feedback to the draft Advice, which will be amended based on the feedback received.

As a new provision of the IORP II Directive, the requirement to conduct an Own-Risk Assessment (ORA) has not only a significant impact on the governance and risk management systems of pension funds but also poses certain implementation challenges.\u00a0 The Opinion on the use of governance and risk assessment documents in the supervision of IORPs sets out EIOPA's expectations on minimum information content to describe how pension funds conduct their ORA and present results from their ORA. NCAs should review and ensure that the ORA is forward-looking, considering internal and external emerging developments likely to affect pension funds' future risk profile. In the area of operational risks, the Opinion on the supervision of the management of operational risks faced by IORPs stresses the importance of forward-looking supervision. With the shift away from defined benefit pensions and the emergence of multi-sponsor IORP providers, NCAs should increasingly pay attention to pension funds' future viability and operational liabilities of defined contribution schemes. Although new market and regulatory developments should generally improve occupational pensions, they may also lead to greater complexity in retaining supervisory oversight of the full range of activities performed by pension funds or outsourced to service providers. Furthermore, the rapid evolution and transmissibility of cyber threats necessitate a forward-looking and cross-sectoral approach to the supervision of cyber risk faced by pension funds.\u00a0 The IORP II Directive includes new environment, social and governance (ESG) provisions. The supervisory oversight of pension funds' exposure to ESG risks is another implementation challenge with ESG being a relatively new practice. Therefore, NCAs should take a holistic view of pension funds' exposure to ESG risks. The Opinion on the supervision of the management of ESG risks faced by IORPs provides an illustrative mapping of how ESG risks may arise in traditional prudential risks. As institutions tasked with a social purpose of providing retirement benefits, European pension funds should be exemplary leaders of responsible ownership. Thus, NCAs should encourage pension funds to consider the impact of their long-term investment decisions and activities on ESG factors through their stewardship role, as well as having regard to the impact of sustainability risks on pension fund liabilities. The common framework is a useful risk assessment tool that can support pension funds in the conduct of their ORA. The Opinion on the practical implementation of the common framework for risk assessment and transparency for IORPs encourages NCAs to make IORPs aware of the availability of the common framework as a tool for risk assessment and to stand ready to support pension funds in the application of the tool. Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA, said: \"The IORP II Directive has profound implications for the governance and risk management of occupational pension funds in Europe. In this context, the EIOPA Opinions lay the foundation for the future supervisory convergence of pension funds' own-risk assessment to ensure sound risk management for the better protection of members and beneficiaries and alignment with society's sustainability goals.\"", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-issues-opinions-governance-and-risk-management-of-pension-funds"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0243", "date": "2019-07-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESAs publish recommendations on the supervision of retail financial services provided across borders", "text": "The Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA - ESAs) published today a report on the cross-border supervision of retail financial services.

EIOPA recently published the key finding of its thematic review on the use of Big Data Analytics (BDA) in motor and health insurance, which revealed a strong trend towards data-driven business models across the insurance value chain. EIOPA's thematic review showed how traditional data sources are increasingly combined - not replaced - with new sources, and that BDA tools such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) are already actively used by 31% of the firms that participated in the survey.\u00a0 The thematic review concluded that there are many opportunities arising from digitalisation, both for the insurance industry as well as for consumers. However, there are also risks that need to be further addressed. Some of these risks are not new, but their significance is amplified in the context of BDA. This is particularly the case regarding ethical issues with the fairness of the use of data and regarding the accuracy and explainability of certain BDA tools such as AI or ML in insurance. The complex nature of some of these new technological developments and their potential deep societal impact coupled with the specificities of the insurance sector justifies the creation of a multidisciplinary Consultative Expert Group supporting EIOPA in the development of digitial responsibility principles in insurance. Taking into account the fairness and ethical perspective these principles will address the use of new business models, technologies and data sources in insurance. While they may cover different areas of the insurance value chain, specific focus will be given to pricing and underwriting, the specificities of the insurance sector. Special consideration shall also be given to the impact on certain groups of vulnerable consumers. The members of the Consultative Expert Group are expected to be highly knowledgeable professionals with extensive practical experience in the areas of BDA (including AI and ML), data science, actuarial science, computer science, insurance law, digital ethics, data protection and/or consumer protection and working for the insurance industry, academia, consumer associations or other relevant stakeholders' organsiations.

The low yield environment remains the key risk for both, the insurance and pension fund sector, and continues to put pressure on profitability and solvency positions. This could trigger further search for yield behaviour by insurers and pension funds, which is slowly becoming visible in the investment portfolio of insurers. EIOPA will therefore continue to monitor closely this risk to identify at an early stage any potential vulnerabilities. At the same time, valuations remain stretched across financial markets and a sudden re-assessment of risk premia cannot be ruled out, which could be exacerbated during a period of economic slowdown with concerns over debt sustainability. A sudden increase in yields driven by risk premia rather than an upward move of the risk free rate curve could significantly affect the financial and solvency position of insurers and pension funds in the short run, as the investment portfolios could suffer large losses, which may only be partly offset by lower liabilities. In this regard, the high degree of interconnectedness with banks and domestic sovereigns of insurers could lead to potential spillovers should a sudden reassessment of risk premia materialize. Relatively high exposures towards real estate can also be observed for insurers in certain countries, making them as well vulnerable to a potential downturn in real estate markets. Furthermore, new types of risks are emerging with the onset of climate change and cyber risk. The climate related risks pose threats in particular for the insurance industry, as insurers act simultaneously as investors and underwriters, while the digital transformation makes insurers and pension funds increasingly exposed to cyber-attacks. In this respect, the 2019 EIOPA stress test exercise for occupational pension funds also incorporates Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), while the results from the questionnaire on cyber risk included in the 2018 Insurance Stress Test exercise will be used to analyse the exposures of insurers towards cyber risk in more detail in the course of 2019.\u00a0 This Financial Stability Report shows that while overall the insurance sector remains adequately capitalized, profitability is under increased pressure in the current low yield environment. The Solvency Capital Requirement ratio for the median company is 223% for life and 207% for non-life insurance sector, although significant disparities remain across undertakings and countries.\u00a0 The reinsurance industry has proven resilient despite again suffering significant catastrophe losses in 2018, which ended up as the fourth costliest year in terms of insured catastrophe losses. In general, natural catastrophe losses are showing an upward trend, with the 10 costliest years in terms of overall losses all occurring after 2004. The price renewals continue to show only moderate price increases, indicating potential excess capacity in the reinsurance market, with the alternative reinsurance capital market in particular showing a strong appetite for insurance risks.\u00a0 In the European occupational pension fund sector, total assets and cover ratios remained broadly stable. However, the current macroeconomic environment and ongoing low interest rates continue to pose significant challenges to the European occupational pension fund sector, in particular for the Defined Benefit (DB) pension schemes. The sector has also come under increased pressure in 2018 by the fall in stock values towards the end of the year, pertaining to significant losses in IORPs' equity investments. Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA said: \"The economic environment has become more challenging for European insurers and pension funds in recent months. The risk of a prolonged low yield environment has become more prominent again, as central banks have become more cautious about monetary tightening amid concerns over economic growth. This is particularly challenging for life insurers and pension funds with long-term liabilities and could trigger further search for yield behavior. At the same time, we continue to observe high valuations in certain equity, real estate and bond markets and a sudden reassessment of risk premia could potentially lead to significant losses in the investment portfolios of insurers, which could be exacerbated during a period of economic slowdown. EIOPA will continue to closely monitor these developments by assessing vulnerabilities at both, the macro- and micro-level and deliver its mandate of supporting the stability of the European financial system.\" This Financial Stability Report also includes a thematic article assessing the impact of green bond policies on insurers.

These guidelines shall provide guidance to market participants on how the outsourcing provisions set forth in the Directive 2009/138/EC, in the Commission's Delegated Regulation 2015/35 and in EIOPA's Guidelines on System of Governance need to be applied in the case of outsourcing to cloud service providers. The consultation is open until Monday, 30 September 2019. In line with its contribution to the European Commission's FinTech Action Plan and taking into account the outcome of its Fourth InsurTech Roundtable on the use of cloud computing by (re)insurance undertakings, EIOPA developed these guidelines addressed to insurance and reinsurance undertakings as well as national supervisory authorities with the following objectives: To provide clarification and transparency to market participants avoiding potential regulatory arbitrages To foster supervisory convergence regarding the expectations and processes applicable in relation to cloud outsourcing The use of cloud outsourcing is a common practice to all financial undertakings and not only to insurance and reinsurance undertakings. Moreover, the main associated risks are similar across sectors. Acknowledging these facts and recognising the potential risks of regulatory fragmentation, in developing these guidelines - in addition to the (re)insurance provisions on outsourcing - EIOPA also considered the most recent guidance published by the European Banking Authority. EIOPA's Guidelines cover the following areas: Criteria to distinguish whether cloud services should be considered within the scope of outsourcing Principles and elements of governance of cloud outsourcing including documentation requirements and list of information part of the notification to supervisory authorities Pre-outsourcing analysis, including materiality assessment, risk assessment and due diligence on the service providers Contractual requirements Management of access and audit rights; security of data and systems; sub-outsourcing, monitoring and oversight of cloud outsourcing and exit strategies Principle based instructions for the national supervisory authorities on the supervision of cloud outsourcing arrangements including, where applicable, at group level Consultation process For responding to this consultation please use this link.

In the field of oversight and supervisory convergence, EIOPA's work included peer reviews, participation in colleges of supervisors to improve supervision of cross-border groups and training activities for national supervisors. EIOPA continued to provide its expertise on issues related to regulation. This included work related to the review of Solvency II, where EIOPA provided advice to the European Commission on the review of the Solvency Capital Requirement.\u00a0 In the context of the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive, EIOPA published a decision, replacing the Budapest Protocol, outlining how national authorities can better cooperate and exchange information on cross-border business issues. EIOPA also updated its conduct of business strategy to reflect changes to the regulatory landscape and developed a framework for conduct risk assessment. Together, these will support national supervisors to identify and mitigate risk earlier. In the area of financial stability, EIOPA carried out an insurance stress test which included a natural catastrophe scenario as well as a questionnaire related to cyber insurance. EIOPA published key reports in 2018 related to cyber insurance, the causes and early identification of failure or near misses in insurance, the development of a macroprudential framework for insurance and the first annual insurance overview. As in previous years, EIOPA continued to monitor developments related to the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, publishing Opinions addressed to national supervisors to ensure that businesses prepare accordingly and risks to consumers are minimised. Digitalisation and sustainable finance were particular areas of focus, with EIOPA contributing to the European Commission's FinTech and Sustainable Finance Action Plans. Throughout the year, EIOPA worked closely with national authorities, European institutions, including the European Banking Authority and European Securities and Markets Authority, and its two stakeholder groups.

Consequently, EIOPA strongly supports the European Commission's Sustainable Finance Action Plan including the aim to integrate sustainability considerations into the prudential and conduct framework for insurers, reinsurers and insurance distributors. In doing so, EIOPA advises to embed carefully sustainability in the delegated regulations under Solvency II and the Insurance Distribution Directive. A key aspect of the advice is the integration of sustainability in the prudent person principle for investments under Solvency II. In particular, insurers should reflect the impact of their investments on sustainability, promoting a stewardship approach by insurers and reinsurers. At the same time, EIOPA emphasises the relevance of integrating sustainability risks in the investment decisions and underwriting practices. In respect of product design and distribution, EIOPA calls for the introduction of a clear reference to ESG considerations in the implementing rules of the Insurance Distribution Directive on product oversight and governance as well as on conflicts of interest.

Based on the forthcoming Regulation on PEPP, EIOPA is required to develop substantial policy and regulatory requirements for the effective implementation of the Regulation. It also mandates EIOPA to exercise a strong role in the future supervision of PEPPs. Hereby, EIOPA will provide for a central information hub on PEPP for all European citizens and competent authorities. \u00a0 In particular, EIOPA is working on the PEPP Regulation's empowerments for EIOPA, for which - in consultation with the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) as well as the European Central Bank (ECB) \u2013 a number of important draft technical standards need to be developed. Further, EIOPA is expected to provide technical advice to the European Commission regarding the areas where delegated acts are required. In light of the policy perspective to design a PEPP that exhibits high quality product features around information provision, risk-mitigating techniques and a cost cap for the basic PEPP, the feedback and support from practitioners can allow EIOPA to find superior solutions and to develop smart policy advice that incentivises financial innovation for the benefit of the European consumer. Therefore, EIOPA is setting up an Expert Panel on PEPP to inform EIOPA's policy work, to test policy proposals and to act as sounding board supporting EIOPA delivering on its mandate. The main tasks of the Expert Panel on PEPP will be: Meet regularly with EIOPA's working structure \u2013 in physical meetings, conference or video calls \u2013 to share technical expertise and evidence. The key areas for input will be on: PEPP Key Information Document (KID), conditions for its revision and provision of the PEPP KID PEPP Benefit Statement (PBS) and supplementary information Cost cap for the Basic PEPP Risk-mitigation techniques EIOPA is seeking for highly knowledgeable professionals with extensive practical experience of designing personal pension products.

In 2018, EIOPA addressed supervisory convergence from different perspectives and using different tools depending on the issue and risks at stake. Among others, the following deliverables were important milestones: The development of a common framework for assessing conduct risk through the product's lifestyle to identify drivers of conduct risk throughout all stages of the product's lifecycle and the implications of these in the emergence of consumer detriment The issuance of the Opinion on non-life cross border insurance business of a long-term nature and its supervision to address specific cross-border situations where evidence has shown that not all market players might be properly and prudently calculating the Technical Provisions and therefore could be jeopardising the policyholders of the host country The use of cooperation platforms to ensure timely identification of preventive measures resulting in successful implementation of recovery measures The issuance of two Opinions related to Brexit to ensure service continuity and consistency in supervisory approaches, namely on the disclosure of information to customers and on risks to the solvency position of (re)insurance undertakings EIOPA also concluded three peer reviews on the principle of proportionality when assessing key functions, on the supervisory assessment of fitness and propriety and on the application of the prudent person rule for the supervision of occupational pension funds. EIOPA continued to detect issues related to cross-border business activities provided through freedom to provide services. Using EIOPA's cooperation platforms preventive measures were timely identified and resulted in the successful implementation of relevant recovery measures and in two cases led to the liquidation of undertakings. EIOPA finalised the 1-year technical assistance to the Romanian national supervisory authority to strengthen its supervisory capacity. EIOPA's own independent assessment and oversight included a number of activities, such as follow-up on the balance sheet review in Bulgaria, participation in 46 cross-border colleges, managing 9 cooperation platforms, 2 joint on-site inspections and 11 bilateral engagements with NCAs including 4 assessments of the implementation of EIOPA's Opinion on Brexit related establishments.

The review considered the basis for the interpretation of the Prudent Person Rule, legal and regulatory frameworks, information gathered for assessment, assessment methods and supervisory actions taken. The review was conducted among 27 NCAs from 24 European Economic Area countries. Institutions for occupational retirement provision should invest their capital in the best interest of members and beneficiaries, i.e. prudently. The IORP Directive therefore requires these institutions to adhere to the Prudent Person Rule and lists a limited number of investment rules that must be respected by all IORPs. This report presents the findings of the peer review, including identified best practices and recommended actions. The review found that supervisory approaches are largely determined by the manner in which the Prudent Person Rule is embedded in national legislation. Supervisory approaches also vary according to type of scheme (defined benefit or defined contribution) and maturity of the pension industry. NCAs that have adopted a risk-based approach or a prudent person plus approach, i.e. a risk-based approach complemented with quantitative limits, use more sophisticated tools and perform their supervisory activities in a risk-based and forward-looking manner. NCAs using a compliance-based approach can enhance their supervision by including risk-based and forward-looking tools in their supervisory practices. Areas requiring action from NCAs were related supervisory structures and resources, information gathering methods, application of the look-through methodology and supervisory assessment of issues related to the Prudent Person Rule. EIOPA will assess the NCAs' compliance with the recommended actions and continue its work to improve supervisory practices in this area at European level. A shorter Executive Summary, the full report and the peer review methodology can be obtained via EIOPA's website. Background The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) regularly conducts peer reviews of supervisory practices, working in close cooperation with national competent authorities (NCAs) to strengthen supervisory convergence and the capacity of NCAs to conduct high-quality and effective supervision. Peer reviews are conducted in the context of EIOPA's oversight work on the basis of the Methodology for Conducting Peer Reviews. NCA representatives form part of the peer review team. The scope of this peer review covered only those NCAs with IORPs operating in their country during the reference period. The reference period of this peer review was 2014 \u2013 2016 under the IORP Directive. As the implementation of the IORP II Directive does not substantially alter the rules for the Prudent Person Rule, the analysis in this report remains valid following the introduction of the IORP II Directive.

EIOPA identified potential divergences in the supervisory practices concerning the supervision of the calculation of immaterial SCR sub-modules. While EIOPA agrees that in the supervisory review process in case of immaterial SCR sub-modules the principle of proportionality applies, it stresses the importance of supervisory convergence as divergent approaches lead to supervisory arbitrage. Consistent implementation of the proportionality principle is key to ensure supervisory convergence for the supervision of the SCR. To guarantee supervisory convergence and consistent application of the proportionality principle EIOPA considers the following key areas: Proportionate approach: Supervisory authorities may allow undertakings, when calculating the SCR at the individual undertaking level, to adopt a proportionate approach towards immaterial SCR sub-modules subject that the undertaking is able to demonstrate required facts to the satisfaction of the supervisory authority. Such facts include among others the justification of the nature and complexity of the risk, consistency with future business model and strategy, stability of the sub-module pattern during the past three years and established proper processes to monitor and evaluate the risks. For the calculation of the SCR at group level, this approach does not apply. An SCR sub-module should be considered immaterial for the purposes of the SCR calculation when its amount is not relevant for the decision-making process or the judgement of the undertaking itself or the supervisory authorities. Prudent calculation: For such immaterial sub-modules, the SCR sub-module should be calculated using prudently estimated inputs, leading to prudent outcomes at the time of the decision to adopt a proportionate approach and subject to the consent of the supervisory authority. In this case, supervisory authorities may allow undertakings not to perform a full recalculation of such a sub-module on a yearly basis taking into consideration the complexity and burden that such a calculation would represent when compared to the result of the calculation. Risk management system and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA): the proper monitoring of any evolution of the risk, either triggered by internal sources (such as a change in the business model or business strategy) or by an external source (such as an exceptional event that could affect the materiality of a certain sub-module), should be ensured. Such a monitoring should include the setting of qualitative and quantitative early warning indicators defined by the undertaking and embedded in the ORSA processes. Supervisory reporting and public disclosure: Undertakings should include information on the risk management system in the ORSA Report as well as structured information on the sub-modules in the Regular Supervisory Reporting and in the Solvency and Financial Condition Report. Supervisory review process: In the context of the on-going supervisory dialogue the supervisory authority should be satisfied and agree with the approach followed by the undertaking and be kept informed in case of any material change. Vice versa, the supervisory authority should inform the undertaking in case there is any concern. In case of any concern, the approach should not be implemented or only subject to additional safeguards, the latter agreed between the supervisory authority and the undertaking. EIOPA is closely monitoring the application of the proportionality principle using its regular supervisory convergence tools such as peer reviews. Background EIOPA's Supervisory Statement on the application of the proportionality principle in the supervision of the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) is without prejudice to the application of the relevant provisions of Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II Directive) and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 (Delegated Regulation), in particular on the simplifications in the standard formula. The standard formula for the SCR aims to capture the material quantifiable risks that most undertakings are exposed to. It might however not cover all exposed material risks of a specific undertaking.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-calls-consistent-application-of-proportionality-principle-supervision-of-solvency"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0267", "date": "2019-04-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESAs publish Joint Advice on Information and Communication Technology risk management and cybersecurity", "text": "The European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) today published two pieces of Joint Advice in response to requests made by the European Commission in its March 2018 Fintech Action Plan: Joint Advice on the need for legislative improvements relating to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) risk management requirements in the European Union (EU) financial sector. \u00a0 Joint Advice on the costs and benefits of a coherent cyber resilience testing framework for significant market participants and infrastructures within the EU financial sector. \u00a0 Regarding the need for legislative improvements, in developing the Joint Advice the ESAs' objective was that every relevant entity should be subject to clear general requirements on governance of ICT, including cybersecurity, to ensure the safe provision of regulated services. Guided by this objective, the proposals presented in the Advice aim at promoting stronger operational resilience and harmonisation in the EU financial sector by applying changes to their respective sectoral legislation. Incident reporting is highly relevant to ICT risk management and allows relevant entities and authorities to log, monitor, analyse and respond to ICT operational, ICT security and fraud incidents. Therefore, the ESAs call for streamlining aspects of the incident reporting frameworks across the financial sector. Furthermore, the ESAs suggest that a legislative solution for an appropriate oversight framework to monitor the activities of critical third party service providers should be considered. Regarding the costs and benefits of a coherent cyber resilience testing framework, the ESAs see clear benefits of such a framework. However, at present there are significant differences across and within financial sectors as regards the maturity level of cybersecurity. In the short-term, the ESAs advise to focus on achieving a minimum level of cyber-resilience across the sectors, proportionate to the needs and characteristics of the relevant entities. Furthermore, the ESAs propose to establish on a voluntary basis an EU wide coherent testing framework together with other relevant authorities taking into account existing initiatives, and with a focus on Threat Lead Penetration Testing (TLPT). In the long-term, the ESAs aim to ensure a sufficient cyber maturity level of identified cross-sector entities. To implement the proposed actions, the ESAs highlight the required legal basis and explicit mandate, which is necessary for the development and implementation of a coherent resilience testing framework across all financial sectors by the ESAs in cooperation with other relevant authorities. Background The European Commission's March 2018 Fintech Action Plan specifically requests the ESAs: To map, by Q1\u20092019, the existing supervisory practices across financial sectors around ICT security and governance requirements, and where appropriate a) to consider issuing guidelines aimed at supervisory convergence and enforcement of ICT risk management and mitigation requirements in the EU financial sector and, b) if necessary, provide the Commission with technical advice on the need for legislative improvements.

The 2019 Spring ESAs' report highlights the following risks as potential sources of instability: Uncertainties around the terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. Further repricing of risk premia and asset price volatility, which could be aggravated in conjunction with a less favourable macro-economic environment and the materialisation of a no-deal Brexit scenario. In light of the ongoing uncertainties, especially those around Brexit, supervisory vigilance and cooperation across all sectors remains key. Therefore, the ESAs calls for the following policy actions by European and national competent authorities (NCAs) as well as financial institutions: Contingency Plans: It is crucial that European Union financial institutions, market participants and their counterparties enact timely contingency plans to prepare for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, including possible market volatility a no-deal Brexit may trigger. The ESAs are closely monitoring Brexit developments and the possible associated risks of a no-deal scenario. The ESAs issued Opinions and Recommendations to provide important guidance for financial institutions, market participants and NCAs in this regard. Stress Tests: Against the backdrop of the potential for sudden risk premia reversals with a risk of rising funding costs, the development and regular use of stress tests across all sectors remains crucial. Therefore, the scenarios for the 2018 bank and insurance stress tests conducted by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) reflected these risks. Furthermore, the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) will present guidelines on fund liquidity and Money Market Fund stress testing during 2019. ESMA is also preparing its next Central Counter Parties (CCPs) stress test. The EBA has started to prepare the methodology for its 2020 stress test exercise, and EIOPA launched its 2019 Occupational Pensions Stress Test. Banks: Banks should develop strategies to carefully manage and address large refinancing needs, including building loss-absorbing capacity. In addition, banks should continue with efforts to address the stocks of non-performing loans (NPLs), and should review their business model to improve profitability. In addition, it is important that banks carefully manage their credit risk and interest rate risk. New bank lending has started to increase and warrants close monitoring of credit quality trends of new lending portfolios. Banks need to ensure that lending standards and covenant requirements do not weaken. The financial sector and banks in particular, need to manage their sovereign exposure carefully, which might imply a significant impact on their profitability and capital. Insurance: Supervisors and insurance companies need to ensure that risks of a potentially sudden reassessment of risk premia and continued low interest rates are properly monitored and analysed as well as appropriate mitigating actions taken. In this context, the vulnerabilities identified in EIOPA's 2018 Insurance Stress Test need to be addressed. \u00a0 Background The Joint Committee is the forum for cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). Through the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering.

For the first time, a European stress test includes an assessment of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) exposures.The core assessment refers to the direct impact of a stressed market scenario on the sustainability and funding of Defined Benefit (DB) pension funds and on the projected future retirement income of members of Defined Contribution (DC) pension funds. Developing further the methodologies and approaches used for previous exercises, the 2019 stress test has been complemented to assess pension funds' potential reaction to the adverse market scenario on their investment allocation to understand better possible conjoint investment behaviours that may be relevant for the stability of the financial markets. Also, the effects of conditional cash in- and out-flows, which may mitigate or amplify the effects of the adverse market scenario on DB pension funds, can be assessed following an enriched cash flow analysis. For the 2019 exercise, EIOPA decided to add an analytical component to focus on pension funds' current exposures and risk management practices regarding ESG factors, which will provide a relevant starting point for ESG-related financial stability assessments of the European financial sector. Addressing stakeholders' feedback, the 2019 Occupational Pensions Stress Test has been initiated on an expeditious timeline to allow pension funds significantly more time to carry out the exercise and for National Competent Authorities to evaluate the results. A dedicated Q&A process with timely publications and a centralised validation procedure will further enhance the practicability and quality of the exercise. The results and conclusions of the stress test are expected to be published by the end of 2019. Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA, said: \"In light of the challenging economic environment and the public's attention to its effects on private pensions, EIOPA's 2019 Occupational Pensions Stress Test is an important, highly relevant and timely exercise to provide insights in the sustainability and vulnerabilities of occupational pensions in Europe.\"", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/launch-of-eiopa\u2019s-2019-occupational-pensions-stress-test-exercise"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0274", "date": "2019-03-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA publishes Discussion Paper on Systemic Risk and Macroprudential Policy in Insurance", "text": "Today, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published its Discussion Paper on Systemic Risk and Macroprudential Policy in Insurance. This Discussion Paper builds on the series of previously published three papers that laid down its policy stance, namely on \"Systemic risk and macroprudential policy in insurance\", \"Solvency II tools with macroprudential impact\", and \"Other potential macroprudential tools and measures to enhance the current framework\". All Papers aim at contributing to the debate on systemic risk and macro-prudential policy in insurance ensuring the reflection of the specific nature of the insurance business. In developing its policy stance, EIOPA followed a systematic approach addressing the following questions in a sequential way: Does insurance create or amplify systemic risk? If yes, what are the tools already existing in the Solvency II framework, and how do they contribute to mitigate the sources of systemic risk? Are other tools needed, and, if yes, which ones could be promoted? EIOPA aims at turning the work done into a specific policy proposal for additional macroprudential tools or measures, where relevant and possible as part of the Solvency II Review. For this purpose, and in order to gather the views of stakeholders, EIOPA is publishing this Discussion Paper on systemic risk and macroprudential policy in insurance, paying special attention to potential new tools and measures, particularly to the tools that are part of the recent European Commission's Call for Advice to EIOPA in relation to the Solvency II Review.

As part of the European Commission's Fintech Action Plan, with this Report EIOPA presents a mapping of current authorising and licencing approaches to financial innovation, including an assessment of how the principle of proportionality is applied in practice. The Report also includes an analysis of the approach to InsurTech start-ups operating as peer-to-peer (P2P) insurers. It also highlights emergent best practices for national competent authorities (NCAs) to support a more systematic approach to InsurTech licencing requirements as well as to ensure through a common application of the proportionality principle consistent and effective supervisory practices across Europe. The evidence gathered points to an InsurTech market in the European Union that remains at an early stage of development, but which at the same time is evolving. Most NCAs have limited experience with InsurTech companies or do not differentiate \"digital\" business models from others. Nevertheless, the joint report on innovation facilitators identified that 24 NCAs have implemented innovation facilitators, which implies that most NCAs are well aware of the importance of innovative technologies and new market players, and the need to understand the associated risks and benefits. At this stage \u2013 also reflecting EIOPA's overall stance of technological neutrality and support for establishing a level playing field for all market participants \u2013 there seems to be no need for further regulatory steps on licensing. However, NCAs should adapt their internal processes and knowhow to reflect the impact of digital transformations and avoid diverging supervisory practices taking into account the cross-border and cross-sectoral nature of some InsurTech developments. The rise of new technology driven business models (e.g. P2P), the use of new technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence (AI), and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)) and the need to rise to the challenge of sound authorisation and on-going supervision of highly digitalised insurers, requires close monitoring of developments. To prepare for potential associated risks NCAs should further enhance cooperation and the exchange of experience among each other and with EIOPA. To this end, EIOPA will work together with NCAs and InsurTech firms by: Exploring options to develop a network of innovation facilitators for the benefit of NCAs and InsurTech firms Assessing what InsurTech-related data might need to be collected systematically to support NCAs and EIOPA work on InsurTech Spearheading further work on understanding new technologies and different business models including the impact of InsurTech on traditional business models on insurance companies Monitoring of outsourcing and the developments in licencing InsurTech companies Analysing the potential growth of the P2P insurance market", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-analyses-licencing-approaches-insurtech"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0277", "date": "2019-03-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA calls for principle based regulation of cloud computing", "text": "Today, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published its Report on Outsourcing to the Cloud: EIOPA's Contribution to the European Commission Fintech Action Plan. The European Commission's FinTech Action Plan requested that the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) explore the need for guidelines on outsourcing to cloud service providers by the end of the first quarter of 2019. In the European financial regulatory landscape, the purchase of cloud computing services falls within the broader scope of outsourcing. For the (re)insurance sector, the current Solvency II regulatory framework includes measures on outsourcing to ensure it does not impact the financial stability and policyholder protection objectives of the framework. EIOPA's guidelines on System of Governance provide some further principle based guidance. Cloud computing is a fast developing service. Based on a survey conducted by the National Supervisory Authorities (NSAs), it is not yet extensively used by (re)insurance undertakings. It is used mainly by newcomers, within a few market niches and by larger undertakings for non-critical functions. However, as part of their wider digital transformation strategies many European large (re)insurers are expanding using the cloud. While cloud computing falls under existing regulatory measures on outsourcing, current guidance on these measures, including at the national level, is not homogenous. At the same time, the majority of the NSAs responsible for both banking and (re)insurance supervision are considering the Recommendations issued by the European Banking Authority (EBA), which have been integrated into further Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements as a reference for the management of cloud outsourcing. The results of the survey confirm the alignment of the usage of cloud computing services by (re)insurance undertakings to the banking sector. This is also true for the risks arising from the usage of cloud computing by (re)insurance undertakings, with few minor (re)insurance specificities. In order to avoid potential regulatory arbitrage and to support market participants in the course of the first half of 2019 EIOPA has concluded in favour of developing Guidelines on Cloud Outsourcing, building on the substance of the EBA Recommendations. EIOPA will seek stakeholders' input via a public consultation and a roundtable discussion with the aim to issue the final guidelines by the end of 2019. To guarantee cross-industry harmonization within the European financial sector and to continue keeping the fruitful alignment, EIOPA agreed with the other European Supervisory Authorities, the European Banking Authority and the European Security Markets Authority, to start in the second half of 2019 a joint market monitoring activity. The objective of this monitoring activity is to gather input for policy views for how in the future to treat cloud outsourcing in the financial sector taking into account the increasing use of the cloud and the potential for large cloud service providers to be a single point of failure.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-calls-principle-based-regulation-of-cloud-computing"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0278", "date": "2019-03-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA determines principles for transparent, timely and clear information provision on pensions", "text": "In the context of the implementation of the IORP II Directive, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published today a second Report on Other Information to be provided to Prospective and Current Members: Guidance and\u00a0 Principles based on Current Practices.

It addresses in particular documents for obligatory disclosure to prospective members and members in the pre-retirement and pay-out phase. Based on the analyses EIOPA together with the national supervisory authorities (NCAs) determined principles and guidance important for the consistent implementation of the IORP II requirements, which are as follows: The calculation and presentation of past performance in the information to be provided to prospective members The presentation of retirement options in the pre-retirement phase The timing of issuance of documents during the pre-retirement phase The communication channels used for the provision of information during the preretirement and the pay-out phase The provision of clear and easy accessible information put in appropriate layers is key for prospective and pre-retirement members to plan and make informed decisions for retirement. Equally important is the right sequence of timing of the provision of information as well as the communication channels including the use of digital communication tools such as on-line tutorials, short videos and on line calculators. As regards the presentation of the information EIOPA advices to conduct consumer testing to learn about the needs of consumers. To raise awareness the pension members should be informed following a systematic approach, i.e. starting five years prior to retirement. The IORP II (Directive (EU) 2016/2341) on the activities and supervision of Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORPs) provides an updated European Union legislative framework for workplace pensions.

In deciding the appeals, and in summary, the Board of Appeal upheld the decision of the ESMA's Board of Supervisors on the central question, which was whether the banks' credit research reports fell within CRAR, but held that the banks (which had voluntarily desisted during the course of ESMA's investigation) had not acted negligently. In reaching its decision:\u00a0 (1) the Board of Appeal rejected the banks' contention that their practice of including \"shadow ratings\" in their credit research reports and similar reports fell within the exclusion in CRAR which covers investment recommendations and investment research; (2) the Board of Appeal rejected the banks' contention that the ESMA's Board of Supervisors' decisions were vitiated under the doctrines of legal certainty and lack of due process; (3) the Board of Appeal agreed with the Board of Supervisors of ESMA on the central point arising on the appeals, namely that the activities of the appellant banks fell within the provisions CRAR with the consequence that to carry them on the banks required to be registered under CRAR; (4) the Board of Appeal considered that though the banks voluntarily desisted during the course of ESMA's investigation, the Board of Supervisors of ESMA was right to find that infringements of CRAR had taken place by reason of the non-registration; (5) the Board of Appeal considered that the Board of Supervisors of ESMA was obliged to take supervisory measures, and since the activities had ceased, was fully entitled to take the view that public notices were appropriate; (6)\u00a0the Board of Appeal considered that the Board of Supervisors of ESMA correctly analysed the legal requirements for the establishment of negligence, which is a precondition for imposing a fine (7) the Board of Appeal differed from the ESMA's Board of Supervisors in its assessment (reflected in the public notices) of whether the banks acted negligently; (8) the Board of Appeal concluded in the very unusual circumstances in which the banks' practice was one which had been carried on in the Nordic debt markets for many years, it not being appreciated that CRAR impacted on this practice, and applying the high standard care required of banks, that the infringements by the banks were not committed negligently; (9) that being so, and it not being suggested that the infringements were committed intentionally, the Board of Appeal decided that the Board of Supervisors of ESMA could not adopt decisions imposing a fine; (10) accordingly, under Article 60(5) of the ESMA Regulation, the Board of Appeal remitted the cases to the Board of Supervisors of ESMA to adopt amended decisions.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/board-of-appeal-publishes-its-decision-nordic-banks\u2019-appeals-decisions-of-esma-\u201cshadow"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0281", "date": "2019-03-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESAs propose amendment to PRIIPs Key Information Document to clarify application to investment funds", "text": "\u200bThe European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) submitted a letter\u00a0to the European Commission on the draft regulatory technical standards to amend the Delegated Regulation covering the rules for the Key Information Document (KID) for Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPs).

The purpose of the framework is to clarify drivers of conduct risk and their implications in the emergence of consumer detriment. It pro\u00advides an aid for understanding issues faced by con\u00adsumers and input on the types of conduct risks EIOPA and the national competent authorities (NCAs) should focus on. It sets a common starting point for more practical supervision of particular products, ser\u00advices or market segments, for instance, through \"deep dive\" thematic work or for future policy development. A strong view on conduct risks is essential for evidence-based and risk-based pre\u00adventative conduct of business supervision. The framework focuses on conduct risk throughout all stages of the product lifecycle, that is to say, from the point before a contract enters into force through to the point when all obligations under the contract have been sat\u00adisfied. The risks set out in this framework cover the following areas: Business model and management risks \u2013 risks arising from how undertakings structure, drive and manage their business and from relationships with other entities in the value-chain. Manufacturing risks \u2013 risks arising from how prod\u00aducts are manufactured by insurance undertakings prior to being marketed and how they are targeted to customers. Delivery risks \u2013 risks arising from how products are brought to the market and from the interaction between customers and insurance undertakings or intermediaries at the point of sale. Product management risks \u2013 risks arising after the sale of the insurance product relating to how prod\u00aducts are managed and how insurance undertakings or intermediaries interact with and service customers until all obligations under the contract have ceased. While the framework is not setting out supervi\u00adsory processes at national level, it nonetheless supports NCAs in identifying conduct and consumer protection risks sufficiently early and sufficiently clearly for the preventative goals of effective con\u00adduct supervision, further enhancing market monitoring and conduct risk assessment and driving forward prac\u00adtical supervisory convergence. It provides a catalogue of risks to consider in practical supervisory work. Going forward, EIOPA expects the framework to con\u00adtribute to the effective implementation of EIOPA's Conduct of Business Supervision Strategy. EIOPA anticipates further work in linking the identified conduct risks with the tools for assessing their impact and supervisory importance, leveraging readily available data as far as possible. This approach will evolve into more systematic ongo\u00ading conduct risk monitoring as an integral part of practical supervision both at national and European levels.

On 1 October 2018, the ESAs wrote a letter to the European Commission expressing their concerns regarding the possibility of duplicating information requirements for investment funds from 1 January 2020 and the importance of legislative changes to avoid such a situation, including a targeted review of the PRIIPs Delegated Regulation. Subsequently, on 8 November 2018 the ESAs published a consultation paper\u00a0proposing targeted amendments that would allow the KID to be applied to all types of investment funds and to address key issues that have arisen since the implementation of the KID, in particular concerning the performance scenarios. In parallel with the ESAs' work, the European co-legislators also initiated discussions on legislative changes relating to the application of the KID by certain investment funds and the timing of a review of PRIIPs. \u00a0When publishing the consultation paper, ESAs stated that they would take into account the latest information regarding these political discussions when deciding upon their final proposals. The Supervisory Statement is issued under Article 29(2) of the ESAs' Regulations as a convergence tool to promote common supervisory approaches and practices. The PRIIPs Regulation (No 1286/2014) defines the main rules and principles for KIDs. It is supplemented by a Delegated Regulation (2017/653) specifying the presentation and contents of the KID, which is based on Regulatory Technical Standards that the ESAs were mandated to develop. Performance scenarios are included in the Section of the KID titled \"What are the risks and what could I get in return?\" They indicate how the investment could perform under various different scenarios.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/esas-publish-recommendations-changes-priips-key-information-document"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0290", "date": "2019-02-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA publishes updated work programme for 2019, within the multiannual work programme 2019 \u2013 2021", "text": "Page Content EIOPA publishes updated work programme for 2019, highlighting and specifying the activities and tasks of the Authority for the coming year, within the framework of a multiannual work programme 2019 \u2013 2021.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-publishes-updated-work-programme-2019-within-multiannual-work-programme-2019-\u2013-2021"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0291", "date": "2019-01-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA\u2019s Risk Dashboard for the third quarter 2018 shows broadly unchanged risk levels for the EU insurance sector", "text": "Page Content \u200bToday, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published its updated Risk Dashboard based on the third quarter 2018 data.

Given the ongoing reduction in the accommodative stance of monetary policy, macro risks stand at medium level. However, further downward revisions of economic growth forecasts remain a concern going forward. Credit and market risks continue at medium level, with Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads for corporate bonds as well as equity market volatility increasing since September. Interlinkages and imbalances risks increased due to an increase in intrasectoral exposures that can be explained by corporate actions and Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) activities by some insurance groups. Insurance risks also increased following the impact on (re)insurers loss ratios of the natural catastrophes observed in 2018Q3, but remain at low level. Underpricing and underreserving driven by the competition could be a concern for some lines of business. Market perceptions are stable at medium level, with insurance stocks outperforming the market in spite of a general deterioration in equity market performance.

This first report provides aggregate data on the costs of insurance-based investment products (IBIPs) across the European Union as well as for certain similar personal pension products (PPPs) and sets out the net performance for the period between 2013 and 2017. It is based on data derived from Key Information Documents (KIDs). \u00a0On past performance insufficient data is available from market providers therefore, EIOPA requested additional data from insurance undertakings. Similar requests were necessary for personal pension products. The report shows that costs vary depending on the type of product, premium, risk category and jurisdiction.

The report concludes that due to the differences between products, there are significant challenges with comparing performance, for example in view of the values of guarantees, the impact of smoothing mechanisms and terminal bonuses of profit participation products, and the impact of risk and volatility.

Reporting requirements also reflect a natural embedded proportionality and in addition risk-based thresholds were included in the reporting Implementing Technical Standard (ITS).

The objective is to contribute to a higher degree of supervisory convergence in the use of capital add-ons between supervisory authorities in the different Member States and to highlight any concerns regarding the capital add-ons framework. The analysis is based on 2017 year-end Solvency II data. Albeit a slight increase in the use of capital add-ons can be seen, the overall usage remains extremely limited. During 2017 six NCAs have set capital add-ons to 23 solo insurance and reinsurance undertakings. This limited usage might be due to the negative image that is attributed to capital add-ons or to the level of judgement that is associated to the decision and calculation of the capital add-ons which in turn inhibits supervisors from using it. Even if the capital add-ons are not used often, when used they have indeed a material impact on the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) of some of the entities. The weight of the capital add-on ranges from a low 1 % to a high 83 % respectively with an average of 30 % of the total SCR. The capital add-on seems to be a good and positive measure to adjust the SCR to the risks of the undertaking, when the application of other measures is not adequate - such as the development of an internal model - as in 18 cases the capital add-on was already set in 2016.

The European Commission is required by Article 242 (2) of the Directive 2009/138/EC to make an assessment of the benefit of enhancing group supervision and capital management under Solvency II. In this regard this report is the response to the European Commission's request of 7 June 2018 and based on the list of specific items the European Commission identified for the scope of the review.\u00a0 Based on the findings presented in the report EIOPA concludes that the tools developed by EIOPA to strengthen group supervision and supervision of cross-border issues contributed to substantial progress in the convergence of practices of National Competent Authorities (NCAs), but significant challenges remain. EIOPA's Guidelines and Supervisory Opinions, together with EIOPA's recommendations to NCAs and group supervisors following bilateral interaction and work within Colleges of Supervisors, have been instrumental steps in fostering a common supervisory culture. Another important tool for supervisory convergence was the development of EIOPA's supervisory handbook, which was supported by a training program where supervisory knowledge and experiences were exchanged. Furthermore, the setting up of cooperation platforms following the\u00a0Decision on the Collaboration of the\u00a0Insurance Supervisory Auhtorities\u00a0has been very successful in increasing the exchange of information between home and host supervisors and in helping home supervisors take the necessary actions to protect policyholders. Still, the current framework has clear limitations and in this area EIOPA's powers should be reinforced.

Compared to the 2017 annual report, this year's annual report includes also an analysis on risk management aspects in view of the specific requirements for LTG measures set out in Article 44 and 45 of the Directive as well as an analysis of detailed features and types of guarantees of products with long-term guarantees. Similar to previous years' analysis, this year's results show that most of the measures are widely used. 737 (re)insurance undertakings in 23 countries with a European market share of 74 % use at least one of the following voluntary measures: The matching adjustment The volatility adjustment The transitional measures on the risk-free interest rates The transitional measures on technical provisions The duration-based equity risk sub-module The volatility adjustment and the transitional measure on technical provisions are particularly widely used. The volatility adjustment is applied by 696 undertakings in 23 countries to mitigate the effect of exaggerations of bonds spreads. The transitional measure on technical provisions is applied by 162 undertakings in 11 countries with respect to contracts concluded before the start of Solvency II in order to ensure a smooth transition to the new regime. The average Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) ratio of undertakings using the voluntary measures is 231 % and would drop to 172 % if the measures were not applied. This confirms the importance of these measures for the financial position of (re)insurance undertakings. The vast majority of products with long-term guarantees occur in life insurance. For a more in-depth analysis the undertakings were requested to provide information on product features, on types of present guarantees and any changes that have been made to their products as well as the reasons for these changes. The proportion of products with guarantees differs by country. In 16 countries, products with at least one guarantee make up over 95 % of the life insurance market. In other countries, the proportion of products with guarantees is much lower. In general, the countries with a low proportion of products with guarantees have significant volumes of unit-linked life insurance. When the data is split between products that are in run-off and those still commercialised, it can be seen that fewer products that are still commercialised contain guarantees than products in run-off. This trend for fewer guarantees in commercialised products can be seen for all types of guarantee except guaranteed annuity benefits. As regards the thematic focus an analysis on risk management aspects in relation to the regulatory reporting by undertakings of the LTG measures was conducted. Such requirements include: The liquidity plan for undertakings applying the matching or the volatility adjustment The assessment of sensitivity of technical provisions regarding the assumptions underlying the extrapolation, the matching and volatility adjustments The assessment of compliance with capital requirements with and without the measures Potential measures to restore compliance and analysis of LTG measures in the own risk and solvency assessment National supervisory authorities identified room for improvement in relation to the level of detail of the regular supervisory reporting.

They are required for the proper implementation of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and will amend the current regulation on the clearing obligation and risk mitigation techniques on OTC derivatives not cleared by central counterparties (CCPs). In particular, the draft RTS on risk mitigation techniques amend the existing RTS by extending the special treatment currently associated with covered bonds to STS securitisations.

This year's exercise assessed the participating insurers' resilience to the following three severe but plausible scenarios: A yield curve up shock combined with lapse and provisions deficiency shocks, which means there is a sudden and sizeable repricing of risk premia and a significant increase in claims inflation. A yield curve down shock combined with longevity stress, which means there is a protracted period of extremely low interest rates accompanied by an increase in the life expectancy. A series of natural catastrophes where European countries are hit in a quick succession of four windstorms, two floods and two earthquakes. In this year's exercise 42 European (re)insurance groups participated representing a market coverage of around 75 % based on total consolidate assets. The reference date was 31 December 2017. The impact of the different scenarios on the balance sheet position and on the capital position of the participating groups was assessed by the excess of Assets over Liabilities and an estimation of the post-stress Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) ratio. Given the operational and methodological challenges related to the recalculation of the group SCR, participating groups were allowed to use approximations and simplifications as long as a fair reflection of the direction and magnitude of the impact was warranted. In the pre-stress (baseline) situation, participants reported an aggregate Assets over Liabilities (AoL) ratio of 109.5 % and a pre-stress SCR coverage of 202.4 %. Overall, the exercise confirmed the significant sensitivity to market shocks combined with specific shocks relevant for the European insurance sector. On aggregate, the sector is adequately capitalised to absorb the prescribed shocks. In the 'yield curve up' scenario, the excess of assets over liabilities is reduced by approximately one third (-32.2 %) and the aggregate post-stress SCR ratio drops to 145.2 %. Six groups reported a post-stress SCR ratio below 100 %. In the 'yield curve down' scenario, the impact on the excess of assets over liabilities is of similar magnitude (-27.6 %) with an aggregate post-stress SCR ratio of 137.4 %. Seven groups reported a post-stress SCR ratio below 100 %. In the natural catastrophe scenario only a small decrease of 0.3 percentage points of assets over liabilities ratio was reported. Overall, the participating groups demonstrate a high resilience to the series of natural catastrophes tested, showing the importance of the risk transfer mechanisms in place, namely reinsurance, which absorbed 55 % of the losses. Consequently, the most affected groups are reinsurers and those direct insurers largely involved in reinsurance activities. One of the objectives of this year's exercise, in line with the recent recommendations from the European Court of Auditors, was to increase transparency by requesting the voluntary disclosure of a list of individual stress test indicators by the participating groups. To date, four of the 42 participating groups provided consent to the publication of the individual results. Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA said: \"This stress test marks an important step forward in assessing the resilience of the European insurance sector to a set of adverse but plausible scenarios and provides a valuable basis for a continuous dialogue with the participating groups on the identified vulnerabilities and the preventive measures and potential management actions to address them, should they materialise.\"", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-announces-results-of-2018-insurance-stress-test"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0313", "date": "2018-12-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA evaluates the European Insurance Intermediaries Markets", "text": "Page Content The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published today the report on the Evaluation of the Structure of Insurance Intermediaries Markets in Europe in accordance with Article 41(5) of the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD). This report, which is the very first one of regular evaluation reports, provides an overview of the status of the European intermediaries markets up to 31 December 2017, relating to data for the period from 2013 to 2017. The evaluation confirms that the European insurance intermediation market is characterised by a very wide diversity of local distribution channels and different definitions adopted at the national level. Registration practices and reporting frameworks also vary amongst Member States, contributing to the diversity in terms of size of European intermediaries markets. The following key developments have been identified: Albeit small, a decrease in the number of registered intermediaries -, despite the number of total registered intermediaries having increased in some markets. The causes behind this trend are varied and Member State-specific, ranging from more stringent regulatory requirements and the growth of alternative innovative distribution channels to other factors such as the liquidation of some insurance undertakings. In most markets, the decrease of registered intermediaries has mainly affected natural persons and those operating as agents. Despite brokers and intermediaries registered as legal persons representing a small portion of the European intermediaries market, their number has been increasing at the European level and in most Member States. A significant number of intermediaries \u2013 representing 56% of the total number - are operating under Member State-specific categories. This diversity and lack of homogeneity makes it difficult to draw conclusions on the prevalent model(s) at the European level. Between 2013 and 2017 the number of intermediaries' notifications to carry out cross-border business has increased. In many Member States they mostly concern pass-porting into neighbouring markets. Despite the available limited information on the role different distribution channels play in placing insurance products on the market, it can be seen that: In many Member States bancassurance plays an important role in the sale of life-insurance products Albeit small, there is an increasing role of direct writers reflecting the newly enlarged scope of the IDD Online insurance marketplaces play increasingly a role in selling insurance products The IDD entered into application in most Member States on 1 October 2018. In accordance with Article 41(4) EIOPA will prepare a report on the application of the IDD by February 2020.

The draft RTS propose, in the context of the United Kingdom's (UK) withdrawal from the European Union (EU), to introduce a limited exemption in order to facilitate the novation of certain OTC derivative contracts to EU counterparties during a specific time-window. The amendments would only apply if the UK leaves the EU without the conclusion of a withdrawal agreement \u2013 a no deal scenario. The draft RTS complement the similar proposal published by ESMA on 8 November1 with respect to the clearing obligation. In the context of the on-going withdrawal negotiations between the EU and the UK, and to address the situation where a UK counterparty may no longer be able to provide certain services across the EU, counterparties in the EU may want to novate their OTC derivative contracts by replacing the UK counterparty with an EU counterparty. However, by doing this, they may trigger the clearing obligation or the bilateral margin requirements for these contracts, therefore facing costs that were not accounted for when the contract was originally entered into. Limited exemption from the bilateral margin requirements to facilitate innovations The draft RTS allows UK counterparties to be replaced with EU ones without triggering the new procedures defined in the bilateral margin RTS. This limited exemption would ensure a level playing field between EU counterparties and the preservation of the regulatory and economic conditions under which the contracts where originally entered into. Its scope, time and intent are aligned with the draft RTS regarding the clearing obligation that ESMA published on 8 November. The window for the novation of OTC derivative contracts which fall under the scope of this amending regulation and the one published by ESMA would be open for twelve months following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. Counterparties can however start repapering their contracts ahead of the application date, making the novation conditional upon a no-deal Brexit, given the conditional application date of these two amending regulations. Participants Brexit preparations The ESAs and other EU authorities and institutions have been clear on the importance for market participants to be prepared for Brexit, including the possibility of a no-deal scenario. These draft RTS provide regulatory solutions to support counterparties' Brexit preparations and to maintain a level playing field between EU counterparties, while addressing potential risks to orderly markets and financial stability. As regards non-centrally cleared OTC derivative contracts, these two measures will be the only regulatory measures the ESAs intend to propose to help address the legal uncertainty raised by the withdrawal of the UK from the EU and to ensure a level-playing field between EU counterparties. Counterparties should start negotiating as soon as possible the novations of their transactions which are in the scope of these amending regulations, given the twelve month timeframe to benefit from it. Next steps The draft RTS have been submitted to the European Commission for endorsement, and they are subject to the scrutiny of the European Parliament and of the Council. Background Final Report.

Insurance undertakings shall take into account the potential long-term impact of investment decisions on sustainability factors (stewardship principle) and where relevant reflect policyholders' Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) preferences. The proposed draft amendments under the IDD relate to the following two areas: Conflicts of interest: When identifying the types of conflicts of interest which might damage the interests of a customer, insurance undertakings and insurance intermediaries should include those that potentially may arise in relation to sustainability. Insurance undertakings and insurance intermediaries should have in place appropriate arrangements to ensure that ESG considerations are included in the advisory process and do not lead to mis-selling practices.

The review examines practices regarding: combining key functions under one holder; combining key functions with administrative, management or supervisory body (AMSB) member\u00adship or with carrying out operational tasks; subordination of one key function under another key function; split of one key function among several holders; assessment of the fitness of key function holders; and outsourcing of key functions. Key functions (risk management, actuarial, compliance and internal audit) are an essential part of a good system of governance under Solvency II, and, are expected to be operationally independent to ensure effective internal control. Given that the implementation of the governance requirements should reflect the natural scale of complexity of the risks run by the insurers, NCAs should apply the principle of proportionality in relation to the compliance with key function holder requirements. The report includes findings from a comparative analysis of the key functions, identifies best practices and presents an overview of recommended actions addressed to the NCAs and EIOPA. Overall, NCAs have adopted similar approaches in assessing how insurers manage key functions and applied the principle of proportionality in their assessment. Four best practices have been identified, providing guidance to NCAs for a more systematic approach regarding the principle of proportionality as well as for ensuring consistent and effective supervisory approaches. The report also identifies some weaknesses, resulting in a number of recommended actions issued to NCAs. Some NCAs had not yet assessed key functions according to the Solvency II requirements. Other NCAs had weaknesses, in particular regarding the depth assessment and mitigating measures demanded from insurers for example in cases where combinations exist. The areas of recommended actions are linked with the supervisory approach of NCAs, the different combinations of key function holders including the internal audit function and AMSB membership as well as the fitness of the key function holders and outsourcing. In line with the recently updated methodology, for the first time, the peer review findings are published in full and on a named basis. As a result of this peer review, many NCAs have already undertaken actions to improve supervisory practices. These improvements will be taken into consideration in the follow-up to this review.

EIOPA identified the following principles for the design and content of a Pension Benefit Statement: The design of the Pension Benefit Statement should be based on a behavioural approach to facilitate a member's decisions about his/her retirement savings The design of the Pension Benefit Statement should be effective, attractive, easy- to read and the information should be layered to help the member find key information at a glance and navigate easily through the content to find answers to his/her questions The Pension Benefit Statement should present pension projections in real terms and in relation to the current income of the Member in order to better understand her/his purchasing power after retirement The Pension Benefit Statement should enable the member to understand the impact of costs on his/her pension entitlements and to compare pension scheme cost levels The Pension Benefit Statement should integrate and complement the communication tools already in place within the Member State (e.g. on-line pension dashboard, pension calculator) to enable insight into the full retirement situation Information contained in a PBS should be comparable to other PBSs at national level, to allow for financial planning. This Report builds on EIOPA's Report on \"Good Practices on Information Provision for DC Schemes\", better known as \"Max Report\".

The ESAs, on 1 October 2018, set out in a letter to the European Commission their intention to make proposals to support legislative changes to avoid the possibility of duplicating information requirements for investment funds from 1 January 2020, and to tackle key issues that have arisen since the implementation of the KID. The consultation paper addresses, in particular, amendments to the information regarding investment products' performance scenarios. The proposals are made in the context of the ongoing discussions between the European co-legislators on the application of the KID by certain investment funds as well as the timing of a wider and more comprehensive review of PRIIPs, which was due this year. The outcome of this targeted review is without prejudice to that wider review, and it would be beneficial to conduct such a wider review early in the next term of the European Parliament. In addition, when deciding upon the nature of their final recommendations following this consultation in January 2019, the ESAs will take into account the feedback from respondents to this consultation and the latest information of these political discussions on the application of the KID by certain investment funds and the timing of the wider review. The deadline for submission of feedback is by Thursday, 6 December 2018. The consultation paper and template for comments can be obtained here. Background The KID for PRIIPs is a mandatory, three-page A4 information document to be provided to consumers before purchasing a PRIIP. PRIIPs include for example funds, structured products, unit-linked and with-profits life insurance contracts, and structured deposits. The PRIIPs Regulation (No 1286/2014) defines the main rules and principles for KIDs. It is supplemented by a Delegated Regulation (2017/653) specifying the presentation and contents of the KID, which is based on Regulatory Technical Standards that the ESAs were mandated to develop. Performance scenarios are included in the Section of the KID titled \"What are the risks and what could I get in return?\" They indicate how the investment could perform under various different scenarios.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/esas-consult-proposed-changes-key-information-document-priips"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0327", "date": "2018-11-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Technical information for Solvency II RFR Term Structures \u2013 End October 2018 and update of the source code", "text": "Page Content Today, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published technical information on the relevant risk free interest rate term structures (RFR) with reference to the end of October 2018 and an updated version of the source code used for the monthly risk-free interest rate term structures (RFR) calculation.

This taxonomy provides National Competent Authorities (NCAs) with the technical means for the submission to EIOPA of harmonised information of all pension funds in the European Economic Area. In close collaboration with the European Central Bank (ECB), EIOPA has developed integrated technical templates and means to report via a single submission both the information required by EIOPA and the ECB. Subject to the adoption of the NCAs this integrated taxonomy may also be used for the collection of the information from the pension funds to NCAs. Such an adoption would reap efficiency gains and further clarity of the reported information. The Pensions XBRL Taxonomy can be reconciled with the Solvency II reporting requirements and is closely aligned with the ECB pensions reporting requirements. The taxonomy uses the same architecture as Solvency II and offers via one common dictionary all insurance, pension funds and ECB \"add-ons\" concepts. The taxonomy dictionary, based on the Data Point Model (DPM), provides a single definition of terms and the relations among them. Today, EIOPA also published a hotfix update for the 2.3.0 Solvency II taxonomy.

In the Opinion, EIOPA urged insurance undertakings to take necessary steps in good time to ensure the continuity of cross-border insurance contracts between the United Kingdom and the European Economic Area without the United Kingdom (EEA30) after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom. EIOPA is closely monitoring the contingency planning of insurance undertakings, in particular of the undertakings from the United Kingdom and Gibraltar with cross-border business in EEA30 countries. The insurers with the largest cross-border business in the EEA30 countries have taken action and are implementing contingency measures. However, to date, 124 undertakings from the United Kingdom and Gibraltar with cross-border business in EEA30 jurisdictions have no or insufficient contingency plans in place to ensure service continuity in case of a withdrawal without an agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union. In case of a withdrawal without an agreement, 9.1 million EEA30 policyholders might face uncertainty and delays in receiving payments. This is significantly down from the total 38 million EEA30 policyholders with a cross-border contract, which shows the extent of action by UK insurers with large cross-border business. The residual cross-border business concerned have insurance liabilities of EUR 7.4bn. The residual business of insurers from the United Kingdom and Gibraltar without sufficient contingency plans represents (in terms of insurance liabilities) only 0.16% of the overall insurance business in the EEA30 countries. The majority of the business (with insurance liabilities of EUR 5.4bn) relates to a handful of insurers in the United Kingdom. The remaining business has mainly low value and short-tail liabilities. Overall, 75% of the contracts concerned belong to portfolios with average written premiums of less than EUR 100 per year. On average, the remaining duration of liabilities of 76% of the contracts is less than two years. The majority of the contracts are with non-life insurers. Only 3 % of the potentially affected policyholders have a contract with life insurers. EIOPA is working with the national competent authorities to address the residual risk. By law, insurance undertakings have to ensure continuity and regularity in the performance of their activities, including the development of contingency plans. Supervisory authorities have to ensure compliance respectively. To avoid disruptions in service continuity, immediate and reinforced actions from undertakings and supervisory authorities are required. Insufficient contingency planning that may result in consumer detriment is a severe governance failure. Policyholders of cross-border insurance contracts with undertakings from the United Kingdom and Gibraltar should be informed by their insurer about the relevant contingency measures they are taking and the impact on their contractual relationship and services. If they have further questions, customers may also wish to contact their insurance company. For general information related to the impact of the withdrawal on insurance contracts and services, the policyholders can contact their national supervisory authority or the supervisory authorities in United Kingdom or Gibraltar. Based on the data collected through the monitoring of the contingency planning and in particular due to the nature and scale of the business concerned, EIOPA's assessment is that the service continuity issue does not give rise to financial stability risks.

A potential future deterioration in the assessment due to political and international trade tensions cannot be excluded. Bond market volatility declined since June and overall Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads remained broadly stable at low levels despite adverse developments in sovereign bond markets in some countries.

EIOPA carried out the analysis in light of the upcoming implementation of IFRS 17 to foster a better understanding of the implications and potential impacts of the standard on European insurance and reinsurance undertakings as well as to provide insights into the future interplay between insurers' financial and prudential reporting. Overall, EIOPA found that the expectedly increased transparency and comparability of insurers' financial statements through IFRS 17, providing better insights into insurers' business models, have the potential to strengthen financial stability in the European Economic Area (EEA). Therefore, EIOPA regards the implementation of IFRS 17 as beneficial for the European public good. IFRS 17's current, market-consistent and risk-sensitive measurement of insurance obligations better reflects economic reality. This supports efficient risk management and allows stakeholders to gain important insights into the entity's business model, exposures and performance. The introduction of IFRS 17 is a long overdue and positive shift of paradigm compared to IFRS 17's predecessor IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. Notwithstanding the significant improvements to the financial reporting applying IFRS 17, EIOPA has reservations on a few concepts that may affect comparability and relevance of IFRS 17 financial statements and should be duly addressed: IFRS 17's principles on determining the applicable discount rate and risk adjustment may have exceeded the appropriate level of allowing for entity-specific inputs and consequently may give rise to significantly different and potentially incomparable results Issues such as level of contracts' aggregation or gains from reinsurance contracts held may lead to further complexity of the financial statements With regards to the practical implementation of IFRS 17, EIOPA's analysis concluded that arguably crucial inputs and processes developed for Solvency II can be used, but may need adaptation to varying degrees. Besides the potential need for adaptation, significant efficiency gains are expected. These efficiency gains are most prevalent in the key building blocks of IFRS 17: cash flows, discount rate and risk adjustment. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts in May 2017. IFRS 17 sets out the requirements in relation to the accounting for insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts held.

The risk-free rate methodology includes updated representative portfolios for the Danish krone and for the country portfolio of Denmark as well as the inclusion of option-adjustments. The updates are based on the results of an in-depth analysis of the composition of the average Danish undertakings' portfolio and the average Danish krone denominated (sub-)portfolio. The analysis provided further insight on the legal and economic background of the Danish covered bond market and confirmed that these assets dominate the relevant portfolios. To capture the features of Danish covered bonds in the risk-free rate methodology accordingly, henceforth an improved version (\"option-adjusted\") of yield and duration data of a dedicated index for these contracts, the \"Nykredit realkreditindeks\", is used in the production process of the risk-free rate. In addition, to ensure consistency in the RFR calculation, assets reported by undertakings as being \"unrated\" were reallocated to the Solvency-II-inherent stepping of credit risk classes (Credit Quality Steps - CQS) by differentiating between financial and non-financial ones. Furthermore, the technical documentation contains some minor amendments in the use of data fields of certain Markit iBoxx indices for the RFR calculation. These non-material changes for a limited number of corporate bonds were necessary to fully unify the concepts used across currencies and CQS.

By this publication, EIOPA ensures consistent calculation of technical provisions across Europe. Representative portfolios are used for the calculation of the volatility adjustment to risk-free interest rates. The information about the update of representative portfolios for the Danish krone and for the country portfolio of Denmark was published in March 2018 .Application of the updated representative portfolios in 2018 The representative portfolios for all other currencies and countries are applied since end of March 2018 onwards, as announced in December 2017. The volatility adjustments are derived from spreads of representative portfolios of assets. The representative portfolios are derived in accordance with Article 49 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35. The volatility adjustment is a measure to ensure the appropriate treatment of insurance products with long-term guarantees under Solvency II. (Re)insurers are allowed to adjust the risk-free interest rates to mitigate the effect of short-term volatility of bond spreads on their solvency position. In that way, the volatility adjustment prevents pro-cyclical investment behaviour of (re)insurers.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-publishes-updated-technical-rfr-documentation-danish-krone-and-denmark"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0347", "date": "2018-08-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA joins the Sustainable Insurance Forum", "text": "Page Content The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) recently became a member of the Sustainable Insurance Forum (SIF), a network of insurance supervisors and regulators from around the world working together on sustainability challenges facing the insurance sector. The SIF, together with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), called on the insurance sector to enhance awareness and intensify climate risk scrutiny in a new issues paper on climate change risks published on 31 July 2018. It underlines physical, transition as well as liability risk related to climate change as key for the insurance sector. Furthermore, analyses of extreme weather events point to a growing trend of damages, both for insured and uninsured goods, leading to a significant protection gap. EIOPA particularly welcomes the case studies regarding supervisory practices, being of high value for all supervisors around the globe. EIOPA will consider transition and physical risk alike and provide input from a European perspective on taxonomy, fiduciary duty, governance, Own Risk and Solvency Assessment as well as disclosure in EIOPA's Sustainable Action Plan planned to be released in autumn this year. Background The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) is a voluntary membership organization of insurance supervisors and regulators from more than 200 jurisdictions with a mission to promote effective and globally consistent supervision of the insurance industry to develop and maintain fair, safe and stable insurance markets for the benefit and protection of policyholders and contribute to global financial stability. The Sustainable Insurance Forum (SIF) is a global network of insurance supervisors and regulators working together to strengthen responses to sustainability challenges facing the insurance sector. Launched in December 2016, the SIF provides a platform for international collaboration among supervisors, facilitating knowledge sharing, dialogue, and uptake of policy innovations. The SIF is convened by UN Environment, which serves as its Secretariat.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-joins-sustainable-insurance-forum"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0348", "date": "2018-08-02", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Deeper understanding of cyber risk needed \u2013 A core challenge for the European Insurance Industry", "text": "Page Content Today, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published its report \"Understanding Cyber Insurance - A Structured Dialogue with Insurance Companies\". Cyber risk is a growing concern for in\u00adstitutions, individuals, and financial mar\u00adkets. In less than five years, it has surged to the top positions in the list of global risks for business. The increasing number of cyber incidents, the continued digital transfor\u00admation and new regulatory initiatives in the European Union are expected to raise awareness and to boost the demand for cyber insurance. With the stand-alone cyber insurance market located predominately in the United States and only a fraction of the total market in Eu\u00adrope, available reports and surveys focus on the global or the US insurance market. So far, very little attention has been paid to the European market. One of the key findings of the report confirms this fact, namely the need for a deeper under\u00adstanding of cyber risk, which is a core chal\u00adlenge for the European insurance industry. This challenge generates or fosters other challenges, such as improper treatment of non-affirmative risks and difficulties to quantify risks, among others. The outcome of this structured dialogue with the industry provides useful insights on the functioning, growth potential, challenges and risks of cyber insurance in Europe in the context of the expected growing importance of cyber insurance in the portfolios of (re)insurers. Although based on a limited sample, the report addresses important key findings, such as the clear need for improved understanding of cyber risk. This report is the first attempt by EIOPA to enhance the level of understanding of cyber risk underwriting with a focus on the European insurance market. Further work in this field is necessary. Therefore, EIOPA included a combination of qualitative and quantitative questions on cyber risk in its 2018 Insurance Stress Test. Background This report is based on a survey with responses to a set of 14 qualitative questions answered by 13 (re)insurance groups located in Switzerland, France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom. The sample of eight insurers and five reinsurers was selected according to the expertise and current exposures in cyber insurance. The survey was conducted through three-party telephone interviews (EIOPA, national supervisory authorities and participating (re) insurance group).", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/deeper-understanding-of-cyber-risk-needed-\u2013-core-challenge-european-insurance-industry"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0349", "date": "2018-07-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA publishes the third paper of a series on systemic risk and macroprudential policy in the insurance sector", "text": "Today, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published the third in a series of papers with the aim of contributing to the debate on systemic risk and macroprudential policy.

Through this series of papers, EIOPA will ensure that any further extension of the debate to the insurance sector fully reflects the industry's specific nature. The third paper culminates the step-by-step approach followed by EIOPA. In the first paper entitled 'Systemic risk and macroprudential policy in insurance', EIOPA identified and analysed the sources of systemic risk in insurance and proposed a specific macroprudential framework for the sector. In the second paper, 'Solvency II tools with macroprudential impact', EIOPA identified, classified and provided a preliminary assessment of the tools or measures already existing within the Solvency II framework, which could mitigate any of the systemic risk sources that were previously identified. This third paper builds on and supplements the previous ones by carrying out an initial assessment of other potential tools or measures to be included in a macroprudential framework designed for insurers. EIOPA carried out an analysis focusing on four categories of tools: Capital and reserving-based tools Liquidity-based tools Exposure-based tools Pre-emptive planning The paper focuses on whether a specific instrument should or should not be further considered.

The results of the first quarter 2018 show that the risk exposure of the insurance sector in the European Union remains stable overall with a decline in macro and insurance risks and an increasing trend in market risks. Persisting low yields and recent adverse developments such as increased protectionism should not be neglected, despite the improvement in recent economic data and the ongoing normalisation of monetary policy. Higher volatility in bond markets since March led to an increase in market risks, but these continue at a medium level. Credit risks also remain at a medium level, although spreads increased across all bond segments. Profitability and insurance risks benefited from the fading out of the impact of last year's natural catastrophes on (re)insurers' technical results. Median solvency ratios remain at satisfactory levels, though the reliance of some life insurers on transitional measures is high.

The mediation conducted by EIOPA's Mediation Panel involved the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de resolution, the French national supervisory authority, as host authority and the Central Bank of Ireland, as home authority of those insurance undertakings that offer this policy on a freedom to provide services in France. In line with the risk-based approach of Solvency II and with the aim of promoting consistent supervisory practices, the Mediation Panel concluded that the determination of the insurance class should reflect the nature of risk of the given insurance policy rather than its actual legal form. Accordingly, the Mediation Panel supported the classification of \"statutory risk\" insurance policy in class 1 (Accident) and class 2 (Sickness) for new authorisations. In case the insurance policy contains death or any other life coverage, an authorisation for life insurance activity is also required. Furthermore, insurance undertakings should have relevant expertise to ensure appropriate pricing, adequate provisioning and claims management practices, relevant to the risks to be covered and to the target market in the host Member State. The Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de resolution and the Central Bank of Ireland, both agreed with the conclusions of the Mediation Panel.

Considering potential future risks to policyholders, EIOPA expects insurance undertakings to avoid as possible direct underlyings of insurance-based investment products, instruments for which the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has issued a ban or restriction. In general, uses of product intervention powers in one sector should never be circumvented by repacking the instruments that have been banned or restricted for offer in another sector. At this juncture, there is no evidence of direct policyholder exposure to CFDs or binary options, whilst the possibility of such policyholder exposure to CFDs or binary options developing seems not highly probable. However, EIOPA's experience has been that unexpected and complex risks have increasingly been offered as potential units within unit-linked contract raising supervisory concerns. For this reason, EIOPA remains cautious on the matter. Within its remit, EIOPA will use the available powers and measures to ensure the integrity, transparency, efficiency, and orderly functioning of financial markets and that customers' interests are adequately protected throughout the European Union. Specifically, EIOPA and National Competent Authorities will continue to monitor the market for insurance-based investment products, including those providing direct exposure to complex and risky underlyings, in view of whether other restrictions or bans should be necessary.

The results show that the risk exposure of the insurance sector in the European Union remained stable. Despite positive macroeconomic developments, low interest rates are still a major source of risk for European insurers. Credit and market risks continued at a medium level. Spreads further decreased and concerns about potential risk mispricing remained. Volatility of equity prices increased and valuations are now slightly lower. Median profitability levels were broadly the same as in the fourth quarter of 2016 and solvency positions continued to be strong for both groups and solo companies. The impact of the natural catastrophes from the third quarter kept insurance risks at a medium level. Market perceptions were mixed, with insurers' stock prices outperforming the market but at the same time there was a deterioration of the external rating outlook for some insurance groups. Background The Risk Dashboard is a quarterly publication summarising the main risks and vulnerabilities in the European Union insurance sector by using a set of indicators grouped into seven risk categories: macro risks, credit risks, market risks, liquidity and funding risks, profitability and solvency, interlinkages and imbalances and insurance (underwriting risks). An additional category \"Market perceptions\" gives the insight in how the insurance sector is perceived by financial markets. More information is provided in the Background Note. The data covered by the Risk Dashboard is based on financial stability and prudential reporting of a sample of 95 insurance groups and 2,930 solo insurance undertakings.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/risk-dashboard-fourth-quarter-of-2017-risk-exposure-of-european-union-insurance-sector"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0373", "date": "2018-04-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "ESAs conclude a multilateral Memorandum of Understanding with the EFTA Surveillance Authority", "text": "The European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA, and ESMA - the ESAs) have concluded a multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on cooperation, information exchange and consultation with the EFTA Surveillance Authority.

With this decision, in line with its mandate, EIOPA defined a single framework for regular information requests towards national competent authorities regarding the provision of occupational pension information to effectively monitor and assess the European occupational pensions sector, with a particular focus on effects to financial stability. The single framework for the reporting of occupational pensions information facilitates smooth and efficient reporting processes and enables EIOPA to receive sufficient information required for appropriate monitoring and thoroughly assessing market developments in the area of occupational pensions as well as to undertake in-depth economic analyses of the occupational pension market. EIOPA's request focuses on three main information areas: Balance sheet information: permitting to assess the financial and solvency position of an Institution for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORP). Inputs and assumptions used for valuations: providing comparable information of highly complex and divergent European occupational pensions sector with the aim to understand specific market's characteristics. Flow data: allowing to detect trends and to analyse reasons for changes from one reporting year to another. The reporting requirements will apply as of the third quarter of 2019 for quarterly reporting and as of 2019 for annual reporting taking into account a transitional period and a proportionate approach for smaller IORPs. The decision benefitted from a very close cooperation with the European Central Bank (ECB) to reach consistency and alignment between the different European reporting standards as well as other international standards enabling pension funds to use a 'single data flow' and a common set of reporting templates. In addition, the feedback received from an intensive consultation process conducted between 26 July and 27 October 2017 contributed positively to take an informed decision.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-significantly-enhancing-european-pensions-statistics"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0377", "date": "2018-04-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA defines its supervisory convergence priorities", "text": "Page Content Today, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) published its supervisory convergence plan for 2018-2019 for the insurance sector, focussing on the implementation of Solvency II and conduct of business supervision.

During last year, EIOPA conducted a number of activities that contributed to high-quality effective supervision, as well as overseeing the level playing field and appropriate application of supervisory measures within the European Union. EIOPA detected a growing number of issues related to cross-border business activities provided through \u2018freedom to provide services\u2019. To enhance cooperation and communication between supervisory authorities in such situations, EIOPA rolled out cooperation platforms, a new and important tool that facilitates stronger and timely cooperation between national supervisors in the assessment of the impact of cross-border activities and identification of preventive measures. Benefits of cooperation platforms have been identified for both home and host supervisors. By the close of 2017, nine cooperation platforms were operational. Furthermore, a wide range of tools such as balance sheet reviews, peer reviews, consistency projects on internal models, participation in meetings of colleges and bilateral engagements with national supervisory authorities continued to be used to enhance the supervisory capacity of national supervisors. For example, EIOPA oversaw a balance sheet review of the Bulgarian insurance sector and assets of its pension funds, issued three supervisory opinions, conducted two consistency projects and participated in 49 cross-border colleges and 14 colleges on internal models. This year, in the field of oversight, EIOPA will pay specific attention to further implementation of prudential regulation, Solvency II, and conduct of business supervision. In particular, EIOPA will continue to focus on the close interaction with national supervisory authorities, improvements in supervisory practices in the authorisation process and supporting reviews of business models to detect those models posing material prudential or conduct risk. Background A cooperation platform is set up when EIOPA and relevant national supervisory authorities see the merit in strengthening cooperation in case of material cross-border business in order to enable a sound internal market in the European Union. The platforms allow home supervisors to make use of expertise and knowledge about local market specificities from host supervisors. Freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services: Under the Solvency II Directive, once authorised by the home national supervisory authority, insurance and reinsurance undertakings have the right to establish a branch within the territory of another Member State (known as freedom of establishment) or may pursue their business in another Member State (known as the freedom to provide services) without any further authorisation.

Background The representative portfolios are derived in accordance with Article 49 of the European Commission's Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35. Representative portfolios exist for currencies and for countries. The volatility adjustment is a measure to ensure the appropriate treatment of insurance products with long-term guarantees under Solvency II. (Re-)insurers are allowed to adjust the risk-free interest rates to mitigate the effect of short-term volatility of bond spreads on their solvency position.

Overall, the ESAs have found that while the development of Big Data poses some potential risks to financial services consumers, the benefits of this innovation currently outweigh these. Many of the risks identified by the ESAs are mitigated by existing legislation. The report concludes that Big Data brings many benefits for the financial industry and consumers, such as more tailored products and services, improved fraud analytics, or enhanced efficiency of organisational internal procedures. On the other hand, financial services consumers should be made particularly aware of some of the risks posed by Big Data. The risks identified by the ESAs include the potential for errors in Big Data tools, which may lead to incorrect decisions being taken by financial service providers. Additionally, the increasing level of segmentation of customers, enabled by Big Data, may potentially influence the access and availability of certain financial services or products. Weighing both the benefits and the risks associated with this innovation, the ESAs have concluded that any legislative intervention at this point would be premature, considering that the existing legislation should mitigate many of the risks identified. The ESAs will continue to monitor any developments in this area in the coming years and invite financial firms to develop and implement good practices on the use of Big Data. The objectives of the report was to map the Big Data phenomenon and assess its potential benefits and risks; raise awareness among consumers of their rights set in existing financial legislation and in other relevant areas; and raise awareness of financial institutions of their obligations set in existing financial legislation and encourage the adaptation of good practices on Big Data. The report results from a consultation conducted between December 2016 and March 2017. Notes for editors The ESAs have created a factsheet on Big Data, aiming at informing consumers of financial services about the impact of Big Data. The factsheet provides consumers with the information about the potential benefits and risks of the use of Big Data techniques and aims to raise awareness of the measures consumers can take if they experience issues related to the use of Big Data. The Joint Committee is a forum for cooperation that was established on 1 January 2011, with the goal of strengthening cooperation between the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively known as the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs). Through the Joint Committee, the three ESAs cooperate regularly and closely to ensure consistency in their practices. In particular, the Joint Committee works in the areas of supervision of financial conglomerates, accounting and auditing, micro-prudential analyses of cross-sectoral developments, risks and vulnerabilities for financial stability, retail investment products and measures combating money laundering. In addition, the Joint Committee also plays an important role in the exchange of information with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/esas-weigh-benefits-and-risks-of-big-data"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0388", "date": "2018-03-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Keynote address by Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA, at the 19.

The ESAs warn consumers that VCs are highly risky and unregulated products and are unsuitable as investment, savings or retirement planning products. The ESAs are concerned that an increasing number of consumers are buying VCs unaware of the risks involved. VCs such as Bitcoin, are subject to extreme price volatility and have shown clear signs of a pricing bubble and consumers buying VCs should be aware that there is a high risk that they will lose a large amount, or even all, of the money invested. Non-regulated products and exchanges Additionally, VCs and exchanges where consumers can trade are not regulated under EU law, which means that consumers buying VCs do not benefit from any protection associated with regulated financial services. For example, if a VC exchange goes out of business or consumers have their money stolen because their VC account is subject to a cyber-attack; there is no EU law that would cover their losses. Operational problems Some VC exchanges have been subject to severe operational problems in the past. During these disruptions, consumers have been unable to buy and sell VCs when they wanted to and have suffered losses due to price fluctuations during the period of disruption. Background information This Warning is based on Article 9(3) of the three ESAs' founding Regulations and follows the publication of two statements by ESMA on Initial Coin Offerings in November 2017 and an earlier Warning to consumers and two Opinions on VCs published by EBA in December 2013, July 2014 and August 2016, respectively.

On average, currently around 15 % of the working population in the European Economic Area, excluding France and the United Kingdom, are active members of pension scheme arrangements covered by the IORP Directive (Directive 2003/41/EC). However, there are significant differences in the coverage across the European Economic Area due to diverse national pension frameworks.

While the number of active cross-border IORPs has remained at the level of the previous years (73 at the end of 2016), more IORPs are expanding their cross-border activities in additional host countries. Furthermore, the number of cross-border IORPs established by service providers to attract multiple unconnected employers is rising. The new IORP II Directive coming into force in January 2019 and EIOPA's future processes of cooperation and exchange of information between National Competent Authorities, currently being revised, may further facilitate multi-employer and multi-country cross-border IORPs.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-publishes-its-2017-market-development-report-occupational-pensions-and-cross-border"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0401", "date": "2018-01-25", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Risk Dashboard for third quarter of 2017 continues to show relative stable risk exposure of the EU insurance sector", "text": "Today, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority published its\u00a0Risk dashboard based on the third-quarter 2017 data. The results show that the risk exposure of the insurance sector in the European Union remained overall stable. Despite positive macro and market trends, the risks linked to the low interest rates and to potential credit risk mispricing continued to be major concerns for the European insurance industry. Improvements in the solvency ratios were mainly driven by the increase in the eligible own funds. Some profitability and underwriting indicators deteriorated due to the impact of the recent natural catastrophes. Market perception remained stable with some improvements in the rating outlooks. Background The Risk Dashboard is a quarterly publication summarising the main risks and vulnerabilities in the European Union insurance sector by using a set of indicators grouped into seven risk categories: macro risks, credit risks, market risks, liquidity and funding risks, profitability and solvency, interlinkages and imbalances and insurance (underwriting risks). An additional category \"Market perceptions\" gives the insight in how the insurance sector is perceived by financial markets.

The report on Capital Add-Ons (CAOs) is published for the first time. The report on exemptions and limitations covers reporting on exemptions for the whole of 2016 and on limitations for the first quarter of 2017. Insurance and reinsurance undertakings are subject to annual and quarterly reporting. According to the Solvency II Directive NCAs can exempt or limit the submission of the quantitative reporting templates (QRTs), based on the criteria such as a defined threshold of the life and non-life market shares in a country, or the size of an undertaking. The report on exemptions and limitations shows that the exemptions from annual reporting concern 134 undertakings and 8 groups, and limitations from quarterly reporting concern 703 undertakings and 21 groups. Twenty-one NCAs have not authorised any undertaking to use exemptions or limitations as many of them were planning to collect at least a complete set of annual reporting before taking a decision on the limitations or exemptions. The market share of undertakings benefiting from limitations stays below the maximum of 20% set in the Solvency II Directive. As at year-end 2016, four Member States have imposed a total of 20 CAOs at individual undertaking level and one Member State has imposed a total of 4 CAOs at group level. Most of the CAOs are related to cases where the risk profile of the undertaking deviated significantly from the assumptions underlying the Solvency Capital Requirement calculated under the standard formula. The CAOs set, vary from 2% to 85% as part of the total Solvency Capital Requirement of the undertaking. Twenty-two Member States implemented a regulation to make use of the option not to disclose capital add-ons for a transitional period. Background Limitation: Under Article 35(6) undertakings can be exempted from quarterly reporting, and any template can be subject to a limitation from regular reporting, without prejudice to Article 129(4) of the Solvency II Directive as regards the Minimum capital requirement (MCR), i.e. the template regarding MCR information cannot be exempted Exemption: Under Article 35(7) undertakings can be exempted from both quarterly and annual reporting, on an item-by-item basis Solvency II Directive defines that exemptions or limitations should only be given to undertakings that cumulatively represent less than 20% of a Member State's life and non-life market share respectively Capital add-ons: Under Article 37 and 232 NCAs have the possibility to set CAOs for a (re)insurance undertaking or for a group.

The aim of the statement is to improve future disclosure of these reports. The analysis is based on a sample of publicly disclosed 2016 SFCRs published by (re)insurance undertakings and insurance groups in the European Economic Area. EIOPA's analysis shows that the majority of reports were published on time and in general complied with the Solvency II requirements. Most of the reports were easily accessible on undertakings' websites. However, EIOPA identified the areas where further improvement as regards the quality of the content of future reports is needed, such as: A more fit-for-purpose Summary Undertaking/group specific information about the own-risk and solvency assessment Better structured and more comprehensive information on risk-sensitivity to different scenarios or stresses More relevant information on bases, methods and main assumptions used for the valuation of assets, liabilities and technical provisions and addressing the uncertainties around valuation More comprehensive information of eligible own funds EIOPA encourages (re)insurance undertakings and insurance groups to take into account the recommendations outlined in the supervisory statement, considering the principle of proportionality, in the preparation of future reports. For the first time next year's (2018) reports require the provision of the comparative information. Therefore, EIOPA outlined its expectations for the mandatory areas and how this information should be presented in the reports. Background According to Articles 51, 53, 54 and 256 of the Solvency II Directive, (re)insurance undertakings and insurance groups are required to produce and publicly disclose the Solvency and Financial Condition Reports.

EIOPA plans to publish the results of this study in the first quarter 2018. The second work stream focused on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the modelling of sovereign exposures based on the information provided by NCAs and selected undertakings. The results show that where sovereign exposures were being modelled in an internal model, the modelling was by and large consistent with the approach taken for similar, non-sovereign instruments. The results are now being reviewed by NCAs. The follow-up of these quantitative observations is being included in the follow-up of the Market and Credit Risk Benchmarking Study. In the third work stream EIOPA analysed quantitative and qualitative aspects of dynamic modelling of the Volatility Adjustment. Different approaches were observed and follow-up discussions with NCAs are continuing with the aim towards a common view taking into account theses different approaches to modelling a dynamic VA as well as the related risk management implications. To monitor and further enhance supervisory practices EIOPA plans to conduct comparative studies on market and credit risk monitoring annually. The data request for the next study will be launched by the end of this year. EIOPA in its Opinion on the preparation for Internal Model applications recommended that NCAs should carry out comparative studies on the NCA level and contribute to and make use of corresponding studies on the EU level coordinated by EIOPA. Furthermore, provision for comparative studies, where undertakings are required to run their models on relevant benchmark portfolios, is included in Article 122 of the Solvency II Directive. Volatility Adjustment The Volatility Adjustment is one of the measures introduced in the Solvency II valuation of insurance contracts with Long-Term Guarantees (LTG) via the Omnibus II Directive (2014/51/EU). It aims at stabilising the Solvency II balance sheet during short periods of high market volatility by adding an extra spread component to the discount rate used for the calculation of technical provisions. When it comes to internal models, there are currently two approaches to take the Volatility Adjustment into account in the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirements. In the first one the Volatility Adjustment is allowed to move in line with credit spreads during the one year forecast (dynamic Volatility Adjustment) and in the second one the Volatility Adjustment is held constant (constant Volatility Adjustment).", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-updates-internal-model-consistency-projects"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0438", "date": "2017-10-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Interview with Manuela Zweimueller and Katja Wuertz for the German Association of the Insured (Bund der Versicherten)", "text": "Page Content", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/interview-manuela-zweimueller-and-katja-wuertz-german-association-of-insured-bund-der"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0439", "date": "2017-10-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA receives request from the European Commission", "text": "The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the other two European Supervisory Authorities - the European Banking Authority, the European Securities and Markets Authority - have received a request from the European Commission to issue recurrent reports on the cost and past performance of the main categories of retail investment, insurance and pension products.

To ensure sound and effective supervision of the insurance and pensions sectors, EIOPA strongly believes in a holistic and integrated approach towards European prudential and conduct supervision and this has been the guiding principle for EIOPA's activity over the past year. In the course of 2016, EIOPA continued with the reinforcement of supervisory functions to move towards supervisory convergence across Europe. The implementation of Solvency II on 1 January 2016 was a milestone in the EIOPA's transition from regulation to supervision, underlining the Authority's commitment to establishing a common European supervisory culture with consistent supervisory practices across the European Union. The current Annual Report provides a detailed overview of tools and projects that EIOPA used across its goals to ensure supervisory convergence, preserve financial stability and reinforce consumer protection for all policyholders and beneficiaries in the European Union. In addition to the extensive tasks associated with Solvency II, such as the secure collection and storage of data, EIOPA initiated the calculation and publication of risk-free rates on a monthly basis as well as, for the first time, publishing a report on long-term guarantee measures and measure on equity risk. EIOPA also conducted an EU-wide insurance stress test, developed its macro-prudential approach to the low interest rate environment in Solvency II, published its fifth annual report on consumer trends and provided advice to the European Commission on a number of issues, including the development of a Pan-European Personal Pension product (PEPP) and, within the context of the Joint Committee, on the Key Information Documents for Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPs). The Authority will build on these achievements in 2017 to consolidate its position as a credible supervisory authority by prioritising the convergence of supervisory practices and playing a role in advancing the European Commission's agenda in areas such as the Capital Markets Union.

Volatility has decreased and inflation rates have slowly started to converge to desired target levels.

The report provides a comprehensive overview of the European occupational pensions landscape, giving a detailed insight into IORPs active nationally and those operating on a cross-border basis. The results of the report show that during the reporting period the number of active cross-border IORPs rose from 76 to 79. There are currently eight home countries for IORPs with cross-border activities in 17 Member States. Out of total IORPs' and Article 4 IORP Directive ring-fenced funds' assets under management (EUR 3,83 trillion), less than 1.65% are related to cross-border activities, which slightly increased compared to the 2015 market development report. This proportion demonstrates that further progress in promoting cross-border schemes in the European Union is needed to create a true single European market for occupational pensions. Home country is the Member State in which the IORP has its registered office and its main administration or, main administration only. In this year's report, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Malta and the UK have been identified as home countries.

The report shows that the European insurance market is dominated by more than 90 cross-border insurance groups with a head office in the European Economic Area (EEA). During the first year of Solvency II, EIOPA observed increased interactions and discussions in the meeting of the Colleges of Supervisors as well as quality and efficiency gains in the information exchange benefitting from the harmonised regulatory reporting requirements. At the same time, EIOPA points to the need for particular attention to the consistency and quality of Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) reports and internal models, to the practices for enhanced risk assessment, to sub-group supervision as well as to optimise the use of EIOPA's Central Repository. EIOPA will reinforce the discussions linked with group supervision, in particular the evaluation of the impact of a group's failure from a European perspective taking into account scale, market position, dimensions of risk exposure, complexity of organisation and operations as well as the quality of supervision. In 2017, the Colleges of Supervisors are requested to further develop effectiveness and efficiency in the supervision of cross-border groups, in the exchange of information as well as in the assessment of joint risks.

This Opinion will contribute to the European Commission's risk assessment work as well as that of the ESAs of fostering supervisory convergence and a level playing field in the area of anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT). In particular, this Joint Opinion finds that problems exist in relation to firms' understanding and management of the ML/TF risk they are exposed to. The Opinion also highlights difficulties associated with the lack of timely access to intelligence that might help firms identify and prevent terrorist financing, and considerable differences in the way national competent authorities discharge their functions. These issues, if not addressed, risk diminishing the robustness of the EU's AML/CFT defences and more action is needed to ensure their effectiveness. This is particularly important as Member States move towards a more risk-based AML/CFT regime that requires a level of ML/TF risk awareness and management expertise, which not all firms and all sectors currently have. Several initiatives are already underway, for example the ESAs' work on a common approach to risk-based AML/CFT supervision that, in the short to medium term, will serve to address many of the risks identified. Legal basis This joint Opinion has been prepared in accordance with Article 6(5) of (EU) 2015/849 (The Fourth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive), which mandates the ESAs to issue a joint Opinion on the risks of ML and TF affecting the EU's financial sector every two years.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/esas-warn-money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing-risks-affecting-eu\u2019s-financial-sector"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0508", "date": "2017-02-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The insurance balance sheet review and pension funds asset review of the Bulgarian insurance and pensions sector now also available in Bulgarian", "text": "Page Content", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/insurance-balance-sheet-review-and-pension-funds-asset-review-of-bulgarian-insurance-and"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0509", "date": "2017-02-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Keynote address by Gabriel Bernardino at the occupational pensions between EU rules and national solutions conference", "text": "Page Content", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/keynote-address-gabriel-bernardino-occupational-pensions-between-eu-rules-and-national"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0510", "date": "2017-02-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA reinforces supervisory cooperation in cross-border activities", "text": "Page Content", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-reinforces-supervisory-cooperation-cross-border-activities"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0511", "date": "2017-02-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Speech by Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA, at the European Consumer Protection Conference, Vienna", "text": "Making a Difference for European Consumers Speech by Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA, at the European Consumer Protection Conference, Vienna", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/speech-gabriel-bernardino-chairman-of-eiopa-european-consumer-protection-conference"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0512", "date": "2017-02-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA reinforces supervisory cooperation in cross-border activities", "text": "", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-reinforces-supervisory-cooperation-cross-border-activities-0"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0513", "date": "2017-02-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EIOPA invites its website visitors to provide feedback", "text": "Page Content The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) is conducting a review of its website by gathering feedback from all website users.

These Guidelines are developed in line with Articles 30(7) and (8) of the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD). The IDD requires that normally an assessment of the suitability or appropriateness of an IBIP for the customer should be carried out by the insurance intermediary or undertaking as part of the sales process. However, where various conditions are satisfied, including that the IBIP is not complex, the IBIP may be sold without a suitability or appropriateness test, i.e. on an execution-only basis. The Guidelines cover the assessment of all types of IBIPs. They include criteria to identify product features, which may be difficult for the customer to understand. They address, for example, the nature of the charges paid by the customer and ability for the customer to surrender the product before maturity. IBIPs which include such features will be deemed complex and therefore not eligible for sale via execution-only. EIOPA invites stakeholders and interested parties to provide their feedback on the Guidelines via the following link. The consultation period will end on 28 April 2017. Important to note: Comments submitted after the deadline or not submitted via the provided template cannot be processed.", "url": "https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/media/news/eiopa-consults-guidelines-complex-insurance-based-investment-products"}, {"id": "EIOPA_NEWS_0520", "date": "2017-02-02", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The guidelines on facilitating an effective dialogue between insurance supervisors and statutory auditors", "text": "Page Content EIOPA published today the translations of the Guidelines on Facilitating an Effective Dialogue between Insurance Supervisors and Statutory Auditors into all official languages of the European Union indicating the start of a \u201ccomply or explain\u201d reporting process.

The update includes the following changes: The use of the input data for the derivation of the risk-free interest rates for the Mexican peso was aligned with the maturity of the underlying financial instruments. The peer country that is used to derive the fundamental spreads for Latvian government bonds was changed from Spain to Ireland to reflect market developments with regard to the government bond yields of these countries. The fundamental spread is used to calculate the matching adjustment and the volatility adjustment to the risk-free interest rates.
