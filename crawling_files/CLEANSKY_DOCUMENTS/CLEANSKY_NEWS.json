More than 90 of TU Delft\u2019s former engineering students with careers spanning from Seattle to Singapore tuned in to hear the session.\u00a0 \u201cWe are aiming to be the first continent that\u2019s climate-neutral,\u201d said Ron, referring to the EU Green Deal. \u201cClimate neutrality will impact every human activity. Ducking this ball is not an option for the aviation sector.\u201d Some might question, why does Europe have to be the first? To this, Ron said, \u201cwe started this problem through the industrial revolution roughly two generations before anyone else. And we benefited massively as a result, so we have a moral incentive to be first.\u201d He then outlined the efficiency gains that aviation has already made \u2013 an impressive reduction of 97.5% of fuel per revenue passenger kilometre (RPK) since the dawn of post-war international aviation and perhaps even more impressively, still over 80% since the era of \u2018mass travel\u2019 started with the eponymous Boeing 747 \u2018JumboJet\u2019. But that\u2019s not enough, he explained.\u00a0 \u201cWhile the aviation system has quadrupled in the thirty years up to 2019, our emissions have \u2018only doubled\u2019. But \u2018only doubled\u2019 is no longer acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot congratulate ourselves. We need to do a lot more.\u201d Ron stressed that neither technology alone nor sustainable aviation fuels alone will lead to climate-neutral aviation. Everything from new technologies within aircraft, to new aircraft configurations, to new engines, to new fuels and new operating paradigms must be explored and improved upon.\u00a0 \u201cWe need skip-a-generation technology,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while we can\u2019t rely on technology alone, we can\u2019t rely on sustainable aviation fuels alone either. And it isn\u2019t \u2018one size fits all\u2019: It\u2019s never been a singular choice between propellers vs jet engines or turboprops vs turbofans. We need to balance our efforts across a spectrum of innovations and accept that there will be \u2018horses for courses\u2019. We need to do more to optimise aircraft for their use in the transport system.\u201d This has traditionally been Clean Sky\u2019s approach \u2013 exploring a wide range of technological options in the search for sustainable solutions.\u00a0 On the oft-publicised view that we should be replacing short flights with rail transport, Ron said \u201cfrankly, it\u2019s hogwash. Short-haul flying is here to stay. Politicians say we will use rail instead, but there will never be an effective railway connection between Rome and Zagreb for instance, or between Amsterdam and Oslo, or between Berlin and Stockholm. There are many connections which are neither convenient, economically justifiable nor particularly sustainable by dedicated rail connections. For instance, if you have only a few hundred passengers per day on a particular route, an aviation link is economic and can be environmentally optimal when you consider the infrastructure as well as the operations. High speed rail needs several 10,000 passengers per day to recoup the infrastructure, not just in economic terms but even in terms of the carbon footprint.\u201d Looking beyond Europe where we are fortunate to have an excellent rail network, it is even more obvious in other continents that air mobility will remain key. However, we will have to readjust how we look at future transport systems. \u201cIf our aim is to address aviation\u2019s climate impact, then focusing on urban air mobility is like building a shed in your backyard while your house is on fire,\u201d said Ron, explaining that at this point investing in urban air transport is just supporting a new mode of air mobility that aims to complement or compete with short range ground transport, and does not address the \u2018mainstream\u2019 passenger or cargo movements by air in the current air transport system.\u00a0 Looking to the future, Ron pointed to hydrogen as being \u201cthe only truly zero carbon solution\u201d that is on the horizon. He warned against using drop-in fuels that rely on \u2018point source\u2019 CO2 and claiming these were \u2018net-zero\u2019. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019s like saying you\u2019ve stopped smoking because you\u2019re using your neighbour\u2019s cigarettes. Or as the CEO of EasyJet Johan Lundgren recently quite correctly noted, drop-in fuels relying on a carbon cycle are really a sophisticated carbon offset mechanism.\u201d To close, Ron told the alumni: \u201cThe journey towards the next generation of aircraft needs to start today. But we need to realise the overall system will need to change too. We need to stop thinking that flying from Helsinki to Tokyo via Munich is normal. It\u2019s not. Europe can lead the transformation and it must.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0", "url": "https://www.cleansky.eu/news/transforming-aviation-to-serve-a-climate-neutral-society-tu-delft"}, {"id": "CLEANSKY_NEWS_0002", "date": "2021-09-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Clean Sky at AED Days: Setting the global standard for sustainable aviation", "text": "Speaking at the AED Days, the flagship event of the Portuguese Aeronautics, Space and Defence Cluster, Clean Sky\u2019s Head of Strategy Ron van Manen emphasised the importance of the Portuguese relationship with Clean Sky and outlined the future of sustainable aviation in Europe. Portugal has been a source of innovative talent for Clean Sky projects \u2013 including SMEs that have \u201ccrossed over\u201d from the automotive sector to the aviation sector, bringing technologies that have a fresh slant when applied to aviation. For Clean Sky, Europe\u2019s most ambitious aeronautical research programme, building synergies with national and regional governments (as well as between other European initiatives such as the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking) is key. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a tremendously productive relationship with the Portuguese government and the national programme,\u201d said Ron. \u201cBut we need to scale this significantly.\u201d He went on to describe the challenge ahead \u2013 how Europe as a whole needs to invest \u20ac12 billion into aviation research if we are to have a climate-neutral fleet by 2050. \u201cIf we want to be the first global climate-neutral continent by 2050, Europe will need to raise her game,\u201d said Ron. \u201cLooking towards 2050, doing nothing is not an option.\u201d No one technology can transform aviation \u2013 \u201cit is a fallacy to believe that sustainable aviation fuels alone will solve the issue, but neither can technology bridge the full gap from today\u2019s air transport sector to that of the future,\u201d Ron said. Instead, a range of measures need to be taken in tandem. Under the new European Partnership for Clean Aviation, which will launch before the end of this year, synergies will become even more important, he said. \u201cWe aim to re-establish the synergies with the regional programmes supported by funding mechanisms such as ESIF, but also strengthen ties with national programmes and build key synergies with EU programmes both within Horizon Europe and other funding instruments.\u201d Currently, EU Regions are making a key contribution to the goals of the Clean Sky 2 programme through European Structural Investment Funds, and have invested over \u20ac50 million into innovative sustainable aviation research. Together with current national programmes in Member States, the public funding from these sources exceeds \u20ac300 million. But during the coming Horizon Europe period, public investment from these sources aligned with the new Clean Aviation partnership\u2019s programme will need to increase tenfold to reach the total level of R&I investment needed to help field a new breed of aircraft that can make climate neutral aviation a reality, according to Ron. If we succeed, and invest strategically in the sustainable aviation innovation space, then the future looks bright. \u201cEurope can be a launch pad for a revolutionary new way of flying. It can set the global standard for sustainable aviation,\u201d said Ron.", "url": "https://www.cleansky.eu/news/clean-sky-at-aed-days-setting-the-global-standard-for-sustainable-aviation"}, {"id": "CLEANSKY_NEWS_0003", "date": "2021-10-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "STIMULANT: Machining new innovations for aircraft manufacturers", "text": "Machining processes are usually one of the latest stages of the manufacturing process for components in safety critical industries, such as aerospace.\u00a0 Conventional machining involves aggressive contact conditions (high mechanical and thermal loads) between the tool and the workpiece. The aim is to remove a certain amount of material in a controlled fashion, but failures in the selection of the processing parameters can lead to poor in-service performance of the component due to the appearance of defects on the material surface.\u00a0 These defects not only consist of visible cracks and surface roughness, but also other aspects, such as the deformation of the microstructure, internal residual stresses, or local micro hardness. All these aspects are encompassed within the concept of \u201csurface integrity\u201d, which has to be enhanced to ensure the safe usage of the machined parts. Clean Sky\u2019s STIMULANT project aimed to maximise the surface integrity after machining, and develop three non-conventional machining processes presenting the potential to produce a step-change in production rates and cost reduction.\u00a0 Laser Assisted Machining (LAM) consists of the scanning of laser beam onto the surface of the workpiece close ahead of the cutting tool to soften the material Abrasive Water Jet (AWJ) removes the material by the erosion caused by abrasive particles embedded into a high-pressure water jet stream, avoiding thermal effects Laser Micro Jet (LMJ) consist of the delivery of a laser beam within a \u201chair-thin\u201d water jet which maintains the focus of the laser along the path and prevents the overheating\u00a0 These non-conventional machining processes have demonstrated the capabilities to accomplish double productivity rates, lower costs, and the creation of special geometries. The generated results enabled the manufacture of components on Inconel 718, which has been validated through the establishment of a hybrid fabrication routes for two aeroengine parts with different safety requirements combining the three novel techniques in a production set-up.

Each year, the ICAO Stocktaking brings together policy makers, government ministers and officials,\u00a0 NGOs and international organisations, \u00a0and senior aviation sector leaders from all segments of the air transport sector to discuss and agree pathways towards sustainable aviation. Attendees discuss a broad range of policy instruments, technologies and innovative solutions and collaborative approaches to make the global aviation system more sustainable, and to work towards vision of a \u2018net zero\u2019 i.e. climate neutral air transport system. This year\u2019s event was particularly important as it was timed to lay the ground for global aviation sector\u2019s response and actions in light of COP26 later this year in Glasgow, and in light of the upcoming ICAO General Assembly in 2022 where the long-term aspirational goals (LTAG) for aviation\u2019s decarbonisation wil be put to ICAOs members for adoption. As a formal UN body, this adoption by the member states of ICAO will carry great significance in securing a global ambition for a \u2018net zero\u2019 aviation system. \u00a0 On 2 September 2021, Clean Sky\u2019s Ron van Manen spoke at the ICAO Stocktaking during the final panel, entitled Enabling the sustainable transformation of the aviation sector. Ron said that although great strides have been made in aircraft emissions, growth of the aviation sector has consistently outpaced these gains. He explained how short-medium range aircraft are producing the lion\u2019s share of emissions. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to focus on making the short-medium range fleet sustainable, before tackling larger aircraft.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWith 2/3 of global emissions from flights <4000km, there is scope for technology disruption!\u201d he said. Ron then outlined the three thrusts that will be pursued under the European Partnership for Clean Aviation: Hybrid electric and full electric architectures Disruptive technologies to enable hydrogen-powered aircraft Ultra-efficient aircraft architectures. \u201cWe need to keep pushing envelope in \u2018traditional\u2019 aeronautical sciences. But alongside this, new disciplines such as hybridisation, high power electrical networks and hydrogen as a future on-board energy source will bring key enablers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe aviation system cannot rely on sustainable \u2018drop in\u2019 fuels alone to seure its future. New technology that exploits the potential for step change in energy efficiency will still be needed, as well as better tailoring aircraft capabilities and designs to actual use. More advanced and disruptive options such as hydrogen-based power must be seriously investigated, as only this brings a \u2018true zero\u2019 carbon future in sight.\u201d Find out more about ICAO Stocktaking", "url": "https://www.cleansky.eu/news/icao-stocktaking-2021-on-aviation-in-sector-co2-emissions"}, {"id": "CLEANSKY_NEWS_0005", "date": "2021-09-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "AORBIT\u2019s test rig for UltraFan\u00ae gets the green light", "text": "Journal bearings \u2013 essentially rotating shafts in a cylindrical housing \u2013 are an integral part of modern aircraft engines.

A wide range of sensors to monitor carrier speeds, oil temperatures, shaft temperatures, motor torques and oil flow are mounted on the rig, enabling real-time monitoring and a fully automated control system.

Sebastien outlined the main results and demonstrators of the Clean Sky 2 programme. \u201cWe have more than 34 flagship demonstrators, more than 106 other demonstrators contributing to the flagship demonstrators, and more than 1000 technologies,\u201d said Sebastien. Seven main areas of intervention are considered essential to deliver Clean Sky\u2019s high level objectives. These are: Next Generation Cockpit Systems, Advances in Wings and Aerodynamics, Optimal Cabin and Passenger Environments, Breakthroughs in Propulsion Efficiency, Novel Aircraft Configurations, Innovative Structures and Production Systems, and finally Aircraft Non-Propulsive and Control Systems.\u00a0 Sebastien outlined the progress that has been made so far, and the success stories from the programme. You can read more about our innovative results here or, you can visit our online stand to take a look. \u201cWe are just at the start of our delivery phase,\u201d Sebastien said, explaining that 30% of the demonstrators will be completed by the end of 2021. All demonstrators will be ready by the end of 2023. Ron van Manen presented the goals of the new European Partnership for Clean Aviation, due to launch by the end of 2021. He outlined why Clean Aviation will focus on short-medium range and regional aircraft. \u201cWhat\u2019s often assumed is that fuel burn tends to lie within the larger range segments. But what we see here is that 1/3 of aviation\u2019s emissions come from flights below 1500 km, and 2/3 from flights below 4000km. That\u2019s quite telling when it comes to where to make a start, especially when we consider that the technology base for these segments of air travel can make a big, disruptive step sooner than long-haul aviation.\u201d New technological developments that we are starting to see emerge can be rolled out much more easily in short-medium range and regional aircraft. A mixed approach will be needed going forwards \u2013 incorporating electric solutions incorporating battery or fuel cell powered propulsion systems, very advanced future gas turbines, new approaches to the overall aircraft driving energy efficiency, and adoption of hydrogen-based energy \u00a0as a key enabler. \u201cThe scale of the challenge is tremendous. We\u2019re talking about a worldwide fleet of over \u00a050,000 aircraft by 2035 that will need to be replaced. But the business case is there. The opportunity is huge. This journey needs to start yesterday,\u201d he said. Axel finished the presentation with a note of hope. \u201cClearly we are heading towards a very busy and exciting time for Clean Sky, for Clean Aviation and the entire aviation sector as a whole. There\u2019s no time to spare. Bold, rapid investment is needed in sustainable aviation.

The ability to design shorter, aggressive compressor transition ducts within those engines is advantageous both from a performance and weight saving perspective. However, increases in bypass ratio, the potential inclusion of geared fan architectures and decreases in the relative size of ultra-high-pressure cores means that the change in radius between compressor spools will increase, making the design of the ducts more challenging. The aerodynamic design of compressor transition ducts is further complicated by the fact they must provide stable performance over a range of operating conditions. That\u2019s why researchers at the IDA project are focusing on new compressor transition duct technologies, which will help very-high bypass ratio turbofan engines to achieve higher bypass ratios and higher overall pressure ratios, making them more fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly. The IDA technologies are more integrated than ever before, which will contribute to the development of future engines that are low in emissions and based on very-high bypass ratio turbofan technology. The experimental test campaign which was carried out at Loughborough was successful. A compressor transition duct design was validated for the Clean Sky Engines WP6 demonstrator. The test revealed clearly how the compressor transition duct performed aerodynamically across a wide range of conditions, and based on the data gathered, the team also developed and validated best-practice computational modelling of compressor transition ducts. This resulted in a useful, robust and validated design tool which can be used to develop future engine designs. In fact, that\u2019s exactly what the team did \u2013 based on the data from the first set of tests and their numerical simulations, the team developed an alternative design for future engines. The team has already published one paper in the ASME Journal of Turbomachinery, and the validated duct design will go forward to high TRL testing in an engine demonstrator.

The OPeRATOR team developed models of in-flight and on-ground aircraft operations that can be configured according to different parameters \u2013 covering all potential mission profiles. The software library of models that was developed for this purpose will help aircraft manufacturers to quickly design aircraft that are both eco-friendly and adhere to safety requirements. Some of the environmentally-friendly options that could be implemented included facilitating a CO2 reduction during taxiing through the use of a hybrid propulsion system. Optimisations of the Environmental Control System (ECS) which could reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are also possible using the OPeRATOR library. The library has already been used for the proprietary design of an engine model, by Collins Aerospace.

Many complex algorithms needed to be implemented to allow for simulating realistic aircraft missions like city-pair (or gate-to-gate) trajectories and other use cases. Another challenge was the requirement for the library to function within different simulation environments (SimulationX, Dymola).

But as aircraft become more electrified, that means an increase in the number of cables needed.

However, when it comes to determining the distance between each group of bundles, there are some difficulties.

But the debates around these policies are complex: what are the best policies to implement? Which ones are most likely to be implemented? When? Will they contribute to the ambitious targets set by the European Green Deal? And finally, how effective will these policies be? They could be pretty effective, according to research carried out by Clean Sky\u2019s GLIMPSE2050 (Global Impact Assessment of Regulations and Polices for Sustainable Aviation by 2050) project.\u00a0 Assuming that Clean Sky 2 would also have matured sustainable aviation technology that would be in operation by 2050, the GLIMPSE2050 team revealed that regulations and policies designed to make aviation more sustainable could reduce global CO2 emissions from aircraft by 11% and NOX emissions by 14%. They found that the policies and regulations on ATM modernisation, wake energy retrieval, and fuel and ticket-based tax appeared to be the dominant contributors to these reductions. Further, the results suggest that the selected regulations and policies tend to decrease the number of flights and number of flown aircraft-kilometres, reduce fleet size (with an increased share of Clean Sky 2 concept aircraft), and increase the share of long-haul flights.\u00a0 The GLIMPSE2050 project took a 4-step approach to reach their conclusions. First of all, they conducted an in-depth literature review compiling information from governmental organisations (e.g. EU and ICAO) and non-governmental and trade organisations (e.g. IATA, ATAG, and ICCT) as well as publications in media (e.g. Aviation Week, EURACTIV, and Flight Global). Next, a series of environmental impact indicators were selected and monitored, such as the total amount of CO2 and NOX emitted by the aircraft fleet worldwide. Thirdly, an assessment approach was set up using forecasts on fleet and movements up to 2050 provided by the Technology Evaluator. These forecasts were based on autonomous economic, demographical and technological developments, but without any of the selected regulations and policies. GLIMPSE2050 fine-tuned EASA\u2019s and ICAO-CAEP endorsed tool AERO-MS to fit with the selected regulations and policies, while matching the fleet and movements forecasts provided by the Technology Evaluator. Finally, GLIMPSE2050 carried out the environmental-impact assessment of the selected regulations and policies. Every regulation and policy was assessed individually first, and then as part of selected groups of regulations and policies. Finally, GLIMPSE2050 assessed all the regulations and policies combined, and came to the conclusion of a 11% reduction in CO2 and a 14% reduction in NOx. Assuming that Clean Sky 2\u2019s innovative technologies would also be in the skies by 2050, GLIMPSE2050 found that there were significant environmental gains.\u00a0 At the end of the project, a workshop was held to disseminate the results of GLIMPSE2050. Participants at the workshop included key stakeholders as well as the European institutions.\u00a0 The project consortium consisted of the Royal Netherlands Aerospace Centre (NLR) with the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) as the topic manager and leader of the Technology Evaluator.

The remaining % will be based on using Sustainable Aviation Fuels. \u201cMaking the aircraft itself and the air traffic management system more efficient will reduce the overall demand for fuel,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that way the aviation ecosystem will avoid investing too much in the infrastructure for scaling up sustainable aviation fuel production above the quantities needed.\u201d When questioned about the potential of hydrogen, Axel said: \u201cI believe that hydrogen is the ultimate solution to achieve climate neutrality in aviation. Either we can burn hydrogen in a combustion engine, which totally eliminates CO2 and reduces other emissions significantly, or we use fuel cells with an even higher greenhouse gas reduction potential, this solution becoming first available for shorter-range aircraft.\u201d Hydrogen usage presents us with some challenges at aircraft level that have yet to be overcome: it is three times the volume of current fuel but with a lower weight. The challenges will have to be addressed during the coming years via extensive research efforts, as well as for the ground infrastructure.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s worthwhile going for it because in our opinion it\u2019s the solution in the mid- to long-term, with first applications targeted for passenger aircraft service by 2035\u201d said Axel.\u00a0 Looking to the global nature of both aviation and climate change, the panellists outlined what the future would look like, with a sustainable fleet in the skies. The panellists were realistic about the outlook:\u00a0 \u201cClearly for very long-haul flights we will use more traditional aircraft but with sustainable aviation fuel on board,\u201d said Filip Cornelis, the Director of Aviation for DG MOVE. \u00a0 But the emphasis on joint agreements and working together towards a common goal was clear.\u00a0 \u201cClimate change measures are only effective if they are implemented globally,\u201d said Laurence Wildgoose of the FAA. \u201cWe need ICAO to help shape the international standards so that they can provide a level playing field for everyone as we reduce emissions.\u201d While the EU and the US in general agreed on their goals for sustainable aviation, they differ on how they intend to get there. The European Commission, represented by Filip Cornelis, the Director of Aviation for DG MOVE, favoured the idea of mandatory usage rates for sustainable aviation fuels while the Americans on the panel, Laurence Wildgoose of the FAA and Nancy Young of Airlines for America, were advocating for more voluntary measures.\u00a0 Filip Cornelis defended the idea of a mandatory rate by saying: \u201cWe see a market failure in terms of sustainable aviation fuels \u2013 there\u2019s very little production and very little demand. The price gap between sustainable aviation fuels and fossil fuels is large.\u201d Nancy Young repeated her desire to see tax incentives for the aviation industry from the government to facilitate a shift to sustainable aviation fuels.\u00a0 \u201cWe really need to ramp up the incentives, like through the blended tax credits, like through the research and development to get those supply chains more aggressive. Down the line, there could be an overarching policy like a mandate if there is a sufficient supply.\u201d The panel agreed overall on the benefits of public-private partnerships, and said that industry and government need to work together to achieve the sustainable aviation goals. \u00a0 Watch the full recording here \u00a0", "url": "https://www.cleansky.eu/news/eu-us-safe-and-sustainable-aviation-webinar-marks-10th-anniversary-of-bilateral-safety"}, {"id": "CLEANSKY_NEWS_0015", "date": "2021-06-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Developing eco-friendly aircraft cargo doors", "text": "Redesigning cargo doors will help to make the aircraft of the future lightweight and more environmentally-friendly, contributing to the Clean Sky\u2019s own objectives as well as the ACARE Flightpath 2050 targets, in alignment with the European Green Deal.\u00a0 Four door demonstrators (called TD1-TD4 respectively) are being finalised, ready for a Clean Sky 2 virtual demonstration day on 8 June. Registration is now open \u2013 you can sign up here!\u00a0 For the first two doors, TD1 and TD2, the MISSP project demonstrated stretch forming, creep forming and laser beam welding, while OASIS project focused on friction stir welding, spot welding. laser beam welding. AddMan worked on additive manufacturing with titanium, CORDIAL developed new fasteners intended for fully automated one-way assembly, and finally RODEO investigated orbital drilling of carbon fibre reinforced stackups of inner skins assembled on top of aluminium parts. For the TD1 door, friction stir welding (FSW) was used to join frames and stringers to the skin panel, which itself was joined from two separate sheets. The advantage of friction stir welding is that two parts can be joined together without pre-drilled holes and without adding material to the structure, making the process both less time consuming and more weight efficient. The idea to weld separate sheets together to a bigger sheet allows for larger parts to be assembled from smaller subassemblies. For the TD2 door, laser beam welding (LBW) was used to join frames and stringers to a skin in an aluminium structure. The advantage of laser beam welding, compared to a riveted structure, is reduced weight. It also avoids holes in the structure. Laser beam welding of aluminium-magnesium alloys (5000-series aluminium) is already well known, but a new alloy, AA5028-H116 containing scandium, was investigated here. The new alloy is weldable, and lacks the decrease in strength that\u2019s been noticed in other weldable aluminium alloys in the past. Welding methods for structural aerospace aluminium alloys have developed greatly over the last few years. Automation of the welding process has led to precision improvements for both laser beam welding and friction stir welding.\u00a0 The same TD2 door structure was also used as a demonstrator for new fasteners (Ergotech and Optiblind) which are starting to appear on the market. The blind fasteners show similar properties to traditionally 2-piece titanium fasteners such as Hi-Lok and Lockbolts, while offering the advantage of being suitable for automated one-way assembly. The fasteners require no machining afterwards and leave a flush surface, which is not the case with the most common blind fasteners on the market today.\u00a0 Optiblind fasteners being installed on the TD2 demonstration door The door was sent to the south of France for a demonstration of orbital drilling as part of the RODEO project.\u00a0The orbital drilling equipment was integrated into a small robotic end-effector combined with a pressure foot to apply gentle pressure on the structure during drilling. This allowed for the drilling of high quality holes whilst applying very small forces to the structure, hence eliminating contamination of trapped chips and burrs in the interface of the joined airframe parts. Completed TD3 Structural Door demonstrator The TD3 door is a somewhat non-conventional demonstrator and only consists of two parts. The skeleton itself is a relatively simple structure machined from a single preformed aluminium billet, the lift fitting has been designed and 3D printed by Fraunhofer using a high strength aluminium alloy (Scallmalloy) and the only fasteners are those which attach the lift fitting to the door. Both the door and lift fitting design are the result of a topology optimisation design process and the manufacturing\u00a0processes make use of recent advances in high speed machining and 3D printing. The striking three colours of the door structure show off the three major phases of the powder coating solution. Firstly, the \u2018naked\u2019 aluminium (after anodising), then in the central part of the door the aluminium has been painted with primer and the grey area has subsequently been powder coated. This provides a corrosion protection level suitable for the inside of a typical aluminium aircraft structure. In some ways this demonstrator is so simple but in other ways it is at the cutting edge of what is possible! \u00a0 Details about the manufacture of the skeleton and the lift fitting of the T3 Door Demonstrator can be read here. Now the door has been painted and the lift fitting has been assembled, marking the closure of a very successful demonstrator where all the major goals have been delivered. The TD4 Door will be one of the fully functional metallic cargo door demonstrators. Two full size \u2018skeletons\u2019 have been successfully bonded, each skeleton consisting of a skin, two doubler sheets, seven frames, one upper and one lower beam. Each skeleton has been cured in a single shot in an autoclave.\u00a0 This bonded solution has the potential for substantial weight and cost savings compared to a traditional riveted structure. A bonded structure has improved load transfer capability compared to a riveted/bolted structure; instead of concentrated load transfer points (rivets) the loads are spread over a much larger area providing the potential for weight savings and fatigue strength. In addition to the environmental benefits of aircraft weight savings there are also environmental benefits during the manufacture process. No chemical etching of the skin is required and a new chromate free and water based adhesive primer provides significant health and safety improvements compared to the more traditional adhesive primers.\u00a0 The tooling and production technology has been changed radically compared to traditional adhesive bonding techniques. The key here is in the complex tooling which allows a relatively complex assembly to be bonded in a single autoclave cycle. \u00a0 Before and After: Adhesive bonded and powder coated (top half) door structure in jig with system installed \u00a0 Door structure being positioned in the tooling prior to autoclave curing Now the next collaboration phase of the project is underway. The second 3D printed lift fitting from Fraunhofer (again in Scalmalloy) has been assembled and Saab Avionic Systems has finalised the installation of the electromechanical systems into the TD4 door. The door has now been sent to the ZAL Centre for Applied Aviation Research in Hamburg for installation and testing in an A321 demonstration fuselage in collaboration with Airbus. Anders Rydbom, Chief Engineer for Saab Aerostructures R&T programs, summarises: \u2018With the completion of the 4 full-scale cargo door technology demonstrators Saab, together with partners, have managed to increase the maturity level of a number of very promising manufacturing technologies for metallic structures. The optimum choice for a future metallic aircraft door (cargo or passenger door) will depend on the expected manufacturing rate and the required time-to-market, since different methods have different characteristics regarding investments needed, industrialisation leadtime, automation possibilities and recurring manufacturing cost.\u2019", "url": "https://www.cleansky.eu/news/developing-eco-friendly-aircraft-cargo-doors"}, {"id": "CLEANSKY_NEWS_0016", "date": "2021-06-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Going electric with the RAISE project", "text": "In the last years, the need for high power density and efficiency has become a central concern in the green transportation sector. The aerospace industry is one of most demanding areas in this sense, and according to the More Electric Aircraft (MEA) concept, replacing the aircraft\u2019s hydraulic/mechanical actuators with electrical drives yields an improvement in efficiency and power density, which means a reduction in weight, fuel consumption and noise/pollutants emission. However, to meet the challenging requirements of modern aerospace applications, power electronics need to be not only efficient but also very reliable. New power devices based on wide bandgap semiconductors (SiC and GaN), with extremely short switching times and the ability to operate efficiently at high temperature, could provide a solution. Adopting these technologies will allow for decreases in total power losses and reductions in the cooling system requirements (and thus heatsink size and volume), as well as increasing the fundamental operating frequencies of electrical machines, leading to smaller and lighter motors and generators. Nevertheless, some reliability issues may arise in this type of electric drives, as faster devices\u2019 commutations are known to trigger faster degradation of coil insulation and cause greater susceptibility to Electromagnetic Interference EMI. Thus, there is a stringent urgency to understand the causes of these issues, model the phenomena and evaluate the impact on the relatability side of these devices against their superior efficiency, in order to propose solutions so as to safely deploy this technology in the aerospace sector. MeltingLab research group of UniMoRe \u2013 (from the left) Prof. Giovanni Franceschini, Marco Pastura, Prof. Davide Barater, Dr. Stefano Nuzzo That was the goal of the RAISE project \u2013 to investigate these issue surrounding wide-bandgap devices (WBG), which are seen as a key technology for future aircraft electrification. In the end, the results of this project will help to safely deploy WBG devices in aerospace applications, to pursue the More Electric Aircraft (MEA) concept, and replace the aircraft\u2019s hydraulic/mechanical actuators with electrical drives. This will lead to an improvement in efficiency and power density, which means a reduction in weight, fuel consumption and noise/pollutants emission. To carry out the research, the project undertook a twofold approach, considering both simulations and experimental validations.\u00a0 On one hand, a propagation model was realised to evaluate the electrical stress. On the other hand, a thorough investigation was carried out to determine the stress levels required to incept partial discharges as a function of several parameters (pressure, temperature, humidity, materials, and impulse voltage features). The stress levels due to the inverter were thus matched to the threshold for partial discharge inception, considering the worst case (cruising altitude). To match the drive characteristics with the insulation, the project also aimed at verifying the inception of partial discharge (PD) on new and aged insulation systems. The capability of designing an insulation system that is PD free by design throughout its lifetime will deliver reliable components. Research group of UniBo \u2013 (from the left) Jacopo Gabriele Marinelli, Prof. Andrea Cavallini, Alberto Rumi Solutions have been identified to reduce the voltage gradient at the electrical machine, and so the electrical stress for the winding insulation, without compromising the performance of the electric drive. These include use of passive filters at the inverter output, new material or thicker dielectric in the design of the windings\u2019 insulation system, form-wound windings and an innovative design for the inverter. The RAISE project published 6 conference papers and 3 journal articles. The data collected during the project have huge potential and they continue to be probed for possible future publications. In particular, based on the results of RAISE, the research group is investigating the ability to contain voltage overshoot at the machine terminals. This would minimise the detrimental effects of increased dv/dt, while maintaining the benefits derived from the fast commutations of the devices.\u00a0 The consortium is made up of the University of Modena and Reggio \u2013 UniMore and Alma Master Studiorum \u2013 University of Bologna \u2013 UniBo.

Typically, half of the air is exhausted and the other half is mixed with outside air (normally supplied through the engine \u2013 bleed air) and re-circulated into the passenger cabin, with a complete cabin air exchange every 2\u20133 min.\u00a0 In most aircraft, recirculated air passes through High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters to extract contaminants suspended in the air (particles, bio-contaminants). These systems are able to capture pollutants such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in addition to the particulate filtration. Other alternative technologies that could be used include electrostatic passive filters/precipitators based on the use of electric fields to remove pollutants, or UVC lamps for air disinfection, but both are susceptible to ozone generation.\u00a0 BREEZE developed an innovative air purification filter that can successfully decrease the level of VOC by 85%, ozone by 80% and presented biocontaminant removal properties. The demonstration was done on a lab-scale prototype under laboratory environmental conditions (simulated aircraft ventilation system conditions). The technology combines adsorption with photocatalysis (PCO). The PCO process consists of the generation of highly reactive species, such as hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH), which are capable of mineralising organic matter and destroying ozone and bio-contaminants. This occurs when a photocatalyst (such as TiO2) is exposed to light with enough energy for its activation (in the case of TiO2, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation with wavelength < 388 nm). By using combined adsorption & TiO2 PCO filters, a synergetic effect can be achieved: i) PCO efficiency is improved, since the contact between the pollutants and the surface of the photocatalyst (where the reaction takes place) is increased by adsorption and ii) the adsorbent acquires a self-cleaning behaviour since adsorbed pollutants are removed by PCO, lengthening the life span of the filter. The efficiency of BREEZE technology for the removal of VOCs, ozone, bacteria, and viruses has been assessed and optimised under simulated real conditions (high flow rate 300 L/s-, 23\u00baC and low humidity -15% relative humidity-), ensuring a lifespan above 3 000 flight hours (FH) by means of ageing tests. How the BREEZE filtration process works \u00a0 If the BREEZE device with HEPA is compared with current technology (HEPA and standard activated carbon filter), BREEZE reduces the potential environmental impacts in all impact categories considered. Focusing on the climate change category, the reduction of the impact is 23% when both systems are compared. In conclusion, assuming that the superior lifetime can be taken advantage of, the BREEZE technology represents a better option in terms of environmental performance.

However, batteries for the electrification of aircraft propulsion systems have to be light-weight, while maintaining high energy storage and power capabilities.\u00a0 State-of-the-art battery systems are still much heavier than conventional fuel sources though, posing a serious obstacle for electrically propelled aviation. In addition to weight, safety aspects need to be thoroughly addressed.\u00a0 The LiBAT project has made a breakthrough in this field, having successfully tested a new highly innovative AC battery system, which is powerful enough to maintain level flight for a manned glider. The lightweight, compact, and highly-integrated battery rotated an electric motor with a propeller attached in a lab setting. The advanced LiBAT technology can be applied to a broad range of applications in the transport sectors, taking us one step closer to a more sustainable future. \u00a0 LiBAT combated the challenging weight targets by implementing an extraordinary level of integration and combination of advanced technologies. By integrating multi-level-inverter (MLI) technology into the battery, the LiBAT team created a unique, tuneable AC battery system that eliminates the need for additional charging or motoring power electronics and thus saves extra weight.\u00a0 Combined with powerful immersive thermal management of both cells and MLIs based on the high-tech liquid NovecTM and a suitable cell choice, both excellent energy density and power performance are realised relative to the low weight and volume of the pack. Both technologies further contribute to superior safety features. Finally, the modular design guarantees a scalable system and promotes integration into a variety of applications and architectures.\u00a0 The LiBAT design cuts the weight of the battery pack by one-third compared to conventional battery solutions, while staying compliant with key aerospace requirements, having even more impact as battery cell technology advances and higher energy densities are achieved. The weight advantages are demonstrated for state-of-the-art Lithium Ion round cells, pushing battery pack energy density to around 200 Wh/kg, compared to appr. 130 Wh/kg for conventional solutions.\u00a0 Short-range applications This is a crucial step for low-emissions flight, targeting all the new short-range to regional range electric aircraft in development.\u00a0 Short range flight is a new development in aviation, and LiBAT allows many large scale urban air mobility, urban air cargo and regional air travel projects to move closer to entry into service. Because these new applications will offer an alternative with unmatched flexibility and speed to car and train trips, it is very important to ensure that such flights do not emit CO2. Because short-range commute flights will group passengers and will rely on a much more sophisticated traffic regulation system than is enjoyed by car traffic, suburban flying may also end up using less energy overall than suburban driving, even when the cars are electric.\u00a0 As the flight range of regional electric aircrafts grows with advancing battery technologies, they may even start to replace some of the conventional short range business flights, with a considerable potential to cut greenhouse gas emissions during operation. LiBAT can help eliminate the need for fossil-fuel-powered tow planes that generally pull today\u2019s leisure gliders. In general, today\u2019s gliders have no propulsion, hence a tow plane is needed to pull the glider with a rope up to the desired altitude.\u00a0 Some examples of what the LiBat solution could be used for include electric air taxis, hybrid propulsion systems, flexible frequency auxiliary networks, electric and hybrid cars, power tools as well as large installations, e.g. marine, rail and grid storages where high voltages and very high energy and power levels are required.\u00a0 There are many roads open to LiBAT going forwards. The battery could be developed to higher TRL levels and improved upon. So far, LiBAT has only been ground tested, and seeing the battery power an actual glider prototype during take-off as well as level flight would be a reasonable next objective. On the other hand, the design could be advanced to a new level by utilising the weight saving potential of structural battery integration into aircraft architectures. Furthermore, new battery cell technologies could be considered.\u00a0 The research was conducted by the German companies TWT GmbH and LION Smart GmbH within the Clean Sky 2 programme, funded by the European Union through the Horizon 2020 initiative.

Axel also spoke about the technical challenges associated with hydrogen technology \u2013 like liquid hydrogen storage, the distribution of liquid hydrogen on board and how to evaporate it for the engine and fuel cell in a reliable and fast manner.\u00a0 He outlined how a first prototype for a short-range aircraft needs to emerge first, with a potential entry-into-service of 2035 at the earliest. Building on these designs, a medium-range aircraft prototype for a potential entry-into-service by 2040 should be targeted, and then by 2050, the aim should be to explore if hydrogen could play a role for the long-range segment.\u00a0 The next main milestone for hydrogen-powered aircraft should be in 2028, by which time Axel envisions that there will be proof of technical feasibility and first certification rules of a commercially available hydrogen aircraft.\u00a0 Going forwards, Clean Sky\u2019s Executive Director stressed the importance of developing a strong network and fostering a high-performing aviation and research ecosystem.

The aviation industry is fully committed to climate neutrality by 2050.\u00a0 In close collaboration with the European Commission, the European aeronautics sector has worked out a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda for Clean Aviation, spanning 2021-2031. Standing on the shoulders of the work done to date in the Clean Sky programmes, Clean Aviation will accelerate the development of disruptive technologies through simulations and integrated demonstrations of novel aircraft and propulsion configurations and systems at the aircraft platform level.\u00a0 Three main thrusts will be pursued as part of the Clean Aviation programme: hybrid electric and full electric concepts, ultra-efficient aircraft architectures, and disruptive technologies to enable hydrogen-powered aircraft. These will aim to culminate in a new breed of regional, short haul and short/medium haul airliners which will be offered to the market by 2030 for an entry into service by 2035. These new aircraft are likely to constitute 75% of the world\u2019s commercial airline fleet by 2050 and thus will have a major impact on aviation\u2019s emissions and climate impact. Clean Aviation will be a core European programme which will be leveraged by further activities funded at national, regional and private levels.

What needs to be done to make aviation greener, without compromising on the economic gains that the sector brings? Is it possible to have an aviation sector that is both competitive and sustainable? As one of the keynote speakers at the EU\u2019s Industry Days on 24 February 2021, Clean Sky\u2019s Executive Director Axel Krein described aviation\u2019s role in society today, and laid out what needs to be done to secure a climate-neutral aviation sector by 2050. He said: \u201cAt Clean Sky, we believe that now is the time for a revolution in aviation\u2026 fast, radical change for a greener, brighter future!\u201d Aviation\u2019s contribution to our economy is impressive \u2013 the sector supports almost 90 million jobs worldwide, with 13.5 million in Europe, and if aviation were a country in 2019, it would rank 17th in the world in terms of GDP, around the same size as the Netherlands. \u201cThe big challenge,\u201d said Axel, \u201cis how can we maintain the positive effects of flying and at the same time eliminate the negative effects, the emissions, and bring them down to zero?\u201d Complicating that challenge is, of course, the pandemic. It\u2019s an understatement, remarked Axel, to say that Covid-19 has \u201cshaken the aviation sector\u201d. But, now aviation has the opportunity to \u201cbuild back better, in a greener and more sustainable way\u201d.\u00a0If we take the right action, and quickly, then \u201c2019 could be the peak year for emissions,\u201d Axel stated. Axel\u2019s message, as he addressed Europe\u2019s flagship annual event on industry, was one of hope, but urgency. Time is of the essence, he stressed, if we are to hit our ambitious climate neutrality goals. Clean Sky is currently investigating a wide range of different technologies that could make climate neutrality a reality. But, a lot more work must be done before those technologies are market-ready, and the time has come to ramp up our green aviation research activities. \u201cIf we want to be zero-emission by 2050, those new [aircraft] products cannot only start to enter the market by 2040 or 2045,\u201d said Axel. It\u2019s not only the aviation industry that\u2019s involved in this transition \u2013 Clean Sky\u2019s programme is based on a collaborative structure with universities, research centres and SMEs all taking part. In fact, SMEs represent almost 40% of Clean Sky\u2019s participants, and their \u201ccreativity is a inspiring force\u201d, said Axel. An investment of \u20ac12 billion into research and innovation is needed right now. Based on the results of that investment, this will trigger aircraft manufacturers to invest a further \u20ac50 billion to develop new aircraft types, and finally, \u20ac5 000 billion spent on product deployment will result in 26,000 new green aircraft. \u201cWe need to significantly invest in research and innovation, but it seems to be a very good return on investment,\u201d said Axel. Clean Sky 2 will continue until 2024, while a new public-private partnership for sustainable aviation looks likely.

But these familiar structures could be optimised to improve their aerodynamics, reducing drag and weight, thereby increasing the overall efficiency of an aircraft.\u00a0 The Clean Sky NEXTTRIP project answered that challenge, developing two new designs \u2013 the V-tail and the T-tail \u2013 which will feed into the final tail for the Next Generation Civil Tilt Rotor \u2013 Technology Demonstrator. Both designs will be lightweight and reduce drag, while retaining or improving the aerodynamic characteristics, stability and the directional control needed both in forward flight and in transition between hover and airplane mode. In addition to the wind tunnel test, a CFD-based aerodynamic optimisation was performed on the aircraft V-tail configuration, aimed at further enhancing aircraft stability and reducing drag. The main outcome of the optimisation was a reduction of V-tail drag by 2-4%. \u00a0Stability characteristics were also improved, and the low-speed pitch-up phenomenon during transition from hovering to forward flight was confirmed to be of low magnitude.\u00a0 The existing 1:5 scale, full-span NICETRIP model was modified to accommodate both T-tail and V-tail geometries. A new set of rotor blades with a 40% bigger radius was also developed to better capture rotor inflow effects over the wings and empennages, improving the aerodynamics of the aircraft and reducing drag. \u00a0 New visualisation technique developed The V-tail was wind-tunnel-tested in DNW-LLF, and a new technique was used to visualise the flow field around the NEXTTRIP V-tail. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) holds that a fluid seeded with tracer particles is assumed to faithfully follow flow dynamics, and is illuminated so that the particles are visible. This new approach involved the employment of large-scale PIV with helium-filled soap bubbles (HFSB) as particles.\u00a0 HFSB are both lighter and larger than conventional particles and they enhance light scatter. The technique yielded excellent flow visualisations, and was tested successfully up to 60m/s with a 3x3 seeding rate.\u00a0 The project also optimised its use of the wind tunnel, by using state-of-the-art remote controls on the model to operate all possible settings of the individual components independently, without the need to enter the wind tunnel to make model changes. New heights NEXTTRIP will be presented at several conferences over the coming year: the AIAA Aviation Forum (Washington DC, USA, 7-11 June 2021) and the 47th European Rotorcraft Forum (Glasgow, UK, 7-10 September 2021);\u00a0 The results will be used in a follow-up project, HIGHTRIP. While NEXTTRIP successfully characterised the new empennages at low speeds, HIGHTRIP will build on those results to create a new tail that is optimised for higher speeds. The final tail will then be integrated into the NGCTR - TM demonstrator.

One challenge in moving towards more electrical aircraft however, is power conversion. If aircraft are to become increasingly electric, then new methods need to be developed that can transfer power efficiently and still provide high power density. The AMPS project rose to that challenge, and successfully developed the first baseless power modules qualified to aerospace standards. This is a breakthrough in aeronautics technology, as it demonstrates that reduced size and weight can be achieved in more electric aircraft compared to traditional power distribution systems.\u00a0 At the beginning of the project, the researchers designed and manufactured a family of power modules, so-called building blocks for aircraft power distribution and conversions systems. Then, a high voltage DC matrix converter demonstrator was built using one of the module types, to show the benefits of the modular approach, including small size, lower weight, and ease of integration into a power distribution system. By replacing a traditional distribution system with a full electrical solution using a power module configured in bidirectional mode, the weight and volume of each power conversion stage was significantly reduced, boosting the power density in the overall system.\u00a0 Following on from the AMPS project, Microchip is working to expand the family of baseless power modules to include a wider range of voltage and power options. With this expanded range of power modules as building blocks, it should be possible to cover most configurations for power distribution and conversion systems. Currently some of these additional power modules have completed the design phase and are now going through validation.

Transforming flight into a climate-neutral activity is a great technical challenge, and requires investigating a variety of avenues. In his keynote address \u2018Paving the way towards climate-neutral aviation\u2019, Axel outlined the strides that Clean Sky has made and the different technology streams that have been investigated since the programme was started 12 years ago.\u00a0 Clean Sky\u2019s current programme examines many facets of aviation technology, from engine design to aerodynamics to cabins, and the solutions that emerge will combine to create a cleaner, greener form of air transport. If you\u2019re interested in discovering those technologies, visit our online stand! Research carried out to date has identified three main change drivers to make aviation climate-neutral: reduction of aircraft fuel burn, air traffic management and operations, and new fuels. Going forwards, the technical areas that show the most promise for the future are: hybrid and full electric architectures, disruptive technologies for hydrogen-powered aircraft and ultra-efficient aircraft structures.\u00a0 Over the past decades, with the exception of the 2020 pandemic, the aviation sector has grown rapidly, bringing economic growth, increased job opportunities and better global mobility. One of the issues facing aviation engineers is how to safeguard that growth and opportunities while protecting the environment from more harm. \u00a0 \u201cThe big challenge is how can we keep the positive effects of flying and eliminate the negative effects,\u201d said Axel.\u00a0 Not all aircraft affect the climate equally \u2013 90% of all CO2 emissions are generated by aircraft that are above 200 seats, while 60% of all CO2 emissions are generated by flights at altitudes lower than 3000 km. According to Axel, we should be focusing our research efforts on those areas that will help reach our goals quicker.\u00a0 \u201cWe are going to see new aircraft appearing in the market designed for climate neutrality with a small number of seats flying at low altitudes, because that is what\u2019s technically feasible,\u201d said Axel. He envisions that in the near-future, there will be less long-haul flights and more stop-overs, which will mean fewer flights at altitudes above 3000km and therefore less impact on the environment. \u00a0 Engaging with local projects has been a core part of Clean Sky\u2019s agenda to date. Clean Sky supports regional projects by engaging in Memoranda of Understandings with various regions. Although these are locally-funded projects, they are complementary to Clean Sky\u2019s objectives and Clean Sky works with regional authorities and local projects to help them to achieve their goals.\u00a0 On 15th January, Clean Sky will also be presenting Special Sessions during the SciTech Forum. These sessions will feature several Clean Sky demonstrators, such as BLADE, the DRAGON concept, the Iron Bird and RACER, and there will be presentations on greener bizjets, smart fixed wing aircraft, load control, regional multi-mission aircraft, power composites, electrified aircraft technology and more.

Together with the use of an expendable core material, a lightweight, eco-friendly air cycle machine part was produced.\u00a0 The synergy formed between injection moulding and thermoplastic automated fiber placements with in-situ consolidation (TP-AFPisc) will power future designs that are lightweight yet perform at a high mechanical level, with automated, easy-to-reproduce production techniques. The TP-AFPisc is different from current state-of-the-art procedures, where composite structures are typically built within process chains.\u00a0 Injection moulding is widely used in thermoplastic processing today, but its use is restricted to short-fibre material only. Traditionally, continuous fibres have not been used in injection moulding due to casting process issues. But IMCOLOR successfully closes this gap, resulting in highly efficient use of the material. The fiber architecture is precisely adapted to the user\u2019s needs by engaging TP-AFPisc manufactured inserts, and an added bonus is that effort in trimming of composite parts is minimized and scrap is reduced. A major environmental benefit of this new procedure is that no hexavalent chromium ion (Cr6+) treatments are necessary in the manufacturing process. Cr6+ is the most toxic form of chromium. It is produced during many industrial processes and it has a strongly negative impact on the environment. What\u2019s more, aircraft efficiency will be increased while fuel and emissions will be decreased thanks to the lightweight structures that result from this new process. And last but not least, parts will be easier to recycle because of the use of thermoplastics and environmentally-friendly process auxiliaries.\u00a0 Some of the challenges faced by the IMCOLOR project included finding a suitable cavity design and injection parameters for encapsulating carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) inserts into the injection moulding polymer \u2013 further it was difficult to find a suitable material combination to facilitate good binding between the CFRP inserts and polymers. CFRP inserts also had to be fixed correctly during the high-pressure injections, so that no deformation or misalignment occurred.\u00a0 Salt cores were also implemented in the Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone (PEEK) injection moulding. PEEK is one of the most versatile materials to use in injection moulding, and salt cores are ideal as they are both expendable and environmentally friendly. The results with salt cores were quite promising, as cross sections with good salt core quality could withstand the injection loads. They achieved proof-of-concept. One unexpected finding was out-of-plane wrinkling defects on 23 plies inserts (thickness 3mm) of the model part. This is probably due to the play fit between the mould core and the insert. However, this effect did not occur for the 70 plies inserts (thickness 10mm) of the demonstrator part. \u00a0\u00a0 Next steps for the topic manager will be further investigation of the new material combination and assessment of the new process in-house.

This innovative Clean Sky demonstrator, led by Leonardo, aims to reduce travel time on short and medium distances of up to 1000km. The TRINIDAT project will also improve the intake duct geometry of NGCTR using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)-based tools, creating redesigned shapes that will be then fitted into the revolutionary aircraft\u2019s configuration.\u00a0 The model that was trialled is comprised of a nacelle, modular intake duct, rotatable spinner hub and wing part including deflectable aileron. The model was mounted on a turntable in the test section floor (which allows angle of attack variation), with direct interfacing to the alpha-mechanism inside the turntable (allowing side slip variation).\u00a0 Due to the tilting rotor head concept of the NGCTR, the intake duct of the rotorcraft changes from an elliptical cross-section to an annular cross-section of the Air Intake Plane (AIP) for the engine, as shown here. This creates additional technical problems for the TRINIDAT researchers to overcome, as normally the AIP remains annular, whereas at the intake lip section the shape and size can be varied for optimisation.\u00a0 In order to assess the flow quality at the AIP annulus, two key elements were addressed. First, a suction system, consisting of Roots Blowers located under the test section, is applied to generate the proper mass flow-rate at the AIP. Second, a specially designed and manufactured rotary rake is mounted at the AIP. This highly instrumented device consists of 40 steady total pressure probes, 10 unsteady flow total pressure sensors and 10 flow-directional probes, while keeping a very low flow blockage. The model also includes a large amount of static pressure taps (on 3 wing sections, intake lip, intake duct and AIP surfaces, in total almost 600). The intake duct also includes some unsteady static pressure sensors. The angular settings of rotor hub pitch, aileron deflection and rotary rake position were remotely controlled. Having passed the wind tunnel test successfully, the next step for the Trinidat team includes an extensive test data analysis, focusing on the evaluation of various flow distortion parameters. Then, the test data will be compared with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) results and finally, experimental results with the baseline intake model will support the CFD-based design of the optimised intake duct. TRINIDAT will then go for a second wind tunnel test, scheduled for 2021.

Using a simple process, the project developed four multifunctional fire-proof panels, which can be used for building aircraft electrical cabinets for power distribution.\u00a0 Two different alternatives with high embedding capabilities have been developed: A light, cost-effective and fire-proof laminate with high embedding capability (for embedding electric wires, fibre optics, electrical connectors and inserts) A one-shot sandwich panel with reinforced skins specific for the embedment of busbars. These panels contribute to Clean Sky 2\u2019s environmental objectives because they reduce weight, reduce volume and integrate functions. Multifunctional structures allow aircraft manufacturers to make important mass savings \u2013 the panels will result in an overall mass saving of between 5 and 10%, in addition to reducing assembly costs and achieving a 10% saving in volume.\u00a0 Strictly speaking, if you only examine the weight of the panels, you will find that these new solutions are not lighter than current state-of-the-art Nomex panel. However, they are more resistant and much more damage tolerant than Nomex panels. They also have very high embedding ability. Therefore, considering the mass of additional elements required in the traditional solution such as attachments, screws, etc, the approaches developed in DEFLECT are very competitive.\u00a0 Some challenges for the DEFLECT project included optimising manufacturing parameters to ensure that the initiative was in line with REACH and fire regulations.\u00a0 Next steps for DEFLECT involve the development and complete validation of a functional prototype, and the consortium partners are currently investigating the possibility of patenting the outcomes of the project.\u00a0 The project consisted of TECNALIA and IRT Saint Exupery with Safran Electrical and Power as the Topic Manager.

The project, started in 2018, has been efficiently implemented in 30 months with four major objectives: To design for flight and manufacture of the cradle supporting the engine and the nacelle;\u00a0 To provide a dedicated instrumentation of the cradle to manage loads, temperature and vibration; To address the engine air flow environment;\u00a0 To measure operational static and dynamic engine load. In a preliminary step, VibraTec performed a market survey to analyse the state-of-the-art of the turboprop architectures. Safety requirements and mechanical main failures have been translated in terms of mechanical loads leading to the definition of a flight envelope specification. Finally, the Tech-TP test bed environment, located in the SAFRAN Helicopter Engines facility at Tarnos, has been inspected and qualified. Simulation of cradle deformation/displacement Starting from these specifications, the second phase of the programme has been focused on the design of the cradle. A detailed dynamic model has been developed to predict the static and the dynamic response of the system. The analysis has covered a wide number of configuration including ultimate loads. The critical design review process was achieved at the end of 2018, opening the manufacturing process. The cradle was manufactured with the support of the SACI Industries. Instrumented by VibraTec with strain gauges, the cradle was qualified in the VibraTec laboratory and then submitted to representative radial and axial loads. The equipment was delivered in May 2019 allowing the first TechTP run to take place in June 2019. The last step of the programme has been dedicated to the exploitation of the static engine test. A thermal analysis has been performed using Computational Fluid Dynamics to adjust the calibration process of the sensors, a minimal requirement to accurately monitor the TechTP demonstrator. In parallel, an inverse method has been set up to measure the operational loads of the TechTP engine. Such indirect measurements allow the characterisation of the static and dynamic forces transmitted by the engine at its mounting points. While direct methods only give access to the resulting forces, the proposed indirect method fully characterises the mechanical impact of the engine on the aircraft, a smart way to specify the engine interface without the cost of flight test. A test campaign has been conducted to deploy the methods. The full operational load characterisation of the TechTP has been extracted, analysed and delivered. The ICTUS programme has strongly contributed to the delivery of the first key demonstrator in Clean Sky 2 with the manufacturing of the cradle. The proposed instrumentation combined with the development of the advanced test methods offers a major breakthrough which will improve the exploitation of static engine test bed.

Ceramic Matrix Composite materials (CMCs) have excellent properties at high temperatures, as unlike metallic materials they do not lose their strength, withstanding up to 1000\u00b0C!\u00a0 This behaviour makes CMCs useful for components in the hot gas section of gas turbines. Because the composites can withstand significantly higher temperatures, the need for cooling air can be greatly reduced. Oxide CMCs also have a lower specific weight than metallic materials. Therefore both the lighter weight as well as the reduced need for cooling air have the potential to lower the environmental footprint of an aircraft engine.\u00a0 Within the project, CMCs based on filament winding (a fabrication technique that involves winding filaments under tension over a rotating cylindrical rod), woven pre-pregs (reinforced material that has been pre-impregnated with a particular material) and triaxial braids (a way of interlacing materials that makes them stronger) were investigated to determine which would be best to use, taking into consideration their thermomechanical and thermophysical properties at relevant temperatures.\u00a0 The woven pre-preg CMC was chosen to be used for the Inter Turbine Duct demonstrator testing and it was further investigated through a verification programme. A quality assurance programme was also worked out for this material. In parallel, the Inter Turbine Duct components were designed by the topic manager, supported by a thermomechanical simulation done by the consortium to generate a CMC-suitable end design. Finally, 25 pre-preg CMC-based Inter Turbine Duct components for demonstrator testing were produced. \u00a0\u00a0 These were important early steps towards potentially bringing European (German) oxide CMC into service in aviation, even though the material quality and dimensional accuracy are not yet fully sufficient.\u00a0 Additionally, due to the high level of quality necessary for aviation applications, the development has broad dissemination potential also for other industries. The developed manufacturing processes and Standard Operating Procedures are already used to produce components for non-aviation applications. For example in heat treatment systems for metals and for high-temperature furnaces. The knowledge gained during the project contributed to the designing of a new production line in Heuchelheim, which will become operational in autumn this year.\u00a0 The German aerospace centre (DLR), the Institut f\u00fcr Textiltechnik of RWTH Aachen University (RWTH ITA) and Schunk Kohlenstofftechnik GmbH (SKT) made up the consortium of AllOxITD.

The goals of Sweden\u2019s National Aeronautics Strategy involve reducing the climate impact of aviation, and the motivation of the Swedish aerospace sector towards making zero-emission aviation a reality can be clearly seen through their active involvement in Clean Sky. Currently, 15 of Clean Sky\u2019s participants hail from Sweden, and they are involved in 30 different projects. Two Swedish companies \u2013 Saab and GKN \u2013 have been Members of Clean Sky since its inception, and both are still heavily involved in Clean Sky\u2019s sustainable aviation activities.

The futuristic design endeavours to optimise travel times while maximising the passengers\u2019 flight experience and, of course, reducing weight and improving eco-compliance thanks to the use of new technologies and materials. According to research carried out by the RATIOS consortium, passengers currently consider air travel to be a stressful and uncomfortable experience, and the project hopes to remedy this. Their research suggests that the air travellers of 2035 will expect a higher level of comfort and services, seamless connectivity and cabin amenities that are really only available for long-range and premium-class travellers today. The development of innovative design concept solutions, technologies and approaches will enable the project to make a high-quality experience available to all passengers.\u00a0 Check out this video to see how the RATIOS team envisages the regional aircraft cabin of the future \u2013 with changes seen in the seating, overhead bin storage areas, windows and ceiling.\u00a0 \u00a0 In order to address some of the \u2018pain points\u2019 that passengers encounter every day on regional aircraft, a human-centred design approach was adopted from the very beginning of the project.\u00a0 This meant that the engineers built on the results that emerged from research into future scenarios and the customer journey. Different cabin architecture concepts and layouts were created along with selected styling concepts. Once the most promising concept was defined and selected, the team performed an overall feasibility study and carried out material and technology scouting and assessment.\u00a0 The passenger experience was always at the heart of the design and to that end RATIOS also carried out colour and lighting research and tested the optimal integration of digital technologies.\u00a0 By leveraging new upcoming technologies, solutions and materials that were identified in 2035 scenarios, the team is creating breakthrough innovative concepts and cabin solutions, in particular examining the fusion between physical features and digital/virtual technologies.\u00a0 After a series of refinements, the final configuration was developed. A 3D virtual model was built presenting detailed definition of geometries and aesthetic and visible details of the passenger cabin items and surfaces.\u00a0 Next steps will involve the implementation of the 3D virtual model and the full-scale physical mock-up in order to run the test validation phase with virtual reality technology. This will involve a selected group of end-users representing the different categories of passengers.\u00a0 The RATIOS project started on 1 March 2019 and will run until 28 February 2021, and received \u20ac551 497.50 in funding from the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 programme for research and innovation.

The goal of SMART-FTI is to design specialised aerodynamic flight test instrumentation that will address the unique demands of the RACER demonstrator. The project will draw on the specialist additive manufacturing skills of the three companies and their knowledge of sensor modules and instrumentation. \u201cThese innovative instrumentation assemblies will enable minimally intrusive measurements with broad coverage to characterise the aerodynamics of a novel helicopter concept and allow for improvements to fuel consumption and performance,\u201d says Katharina Kreitz of Vectoflow GmbH, the coordinator of the project. \u201cThe key factors of non-intrusiveness, easy and fast installation, and flexibility are the core objectives.\u201d The project\u2019s concept centres on a modular approach, designing instrumentation using additive manufacturing which will be thin, lightweight, and of high-strength and temperature resistance, also improving the aerodynamic performance of RACER. In this way, it will contribute to Clean Sky\u2019s environmental objectives.\u00a0 Different sensors, probes and all other elements will be integrated into the modules using a \u2018plug&play\u2019 approach.

The Clean Sky Academy Working Group was established back in 2015. The objective was to better involve students in the programme through strengthening the link with academia and research centres. The group was composed of a number of independent experts with academic backgrounds. In early 2017, we decided to formalise this working group at institutional level by inviting the major European associations active in the academic and research community - PEGASUS, EASN, EREA, CEAS and EUROAVIA - to officially appoint one representative to the group. The group is now composed of representatives of these bodies, complemented by some independent high-level experts non-affiliated to the above and also from academia and research bodies, selected via an open call for expression of interest. In terms of membership through these associations, we can now reach out to more than 40000 email addresses all over Europe. What are the main objectives of the working group? By regulation, Clean Sky is already supported by two advisory bodies: the States Representatives Group (SRG) and the Scientific Committee, which have advisory roles in terms of the JU\u2019s Work Plan, its strategic orientation and its scientific priorities. The Clean Sky Academy Working Group was created to reinforce the links with academia and academic research activities and stakeholders, to strengthen their involvement in the Clean Sky 2 Programme and formalise interfaces with their various representative bodies in order to reach out to their networks and to the academic community at large. The group provides advice to the JU in the form of reports, opinions and recommendations on: Dissemination and communication initiatives, by supporting the dissemination of relevant Clean Sky information to their respective networks and by arranging dedicated communication initiatives on Clean Sky during the conferences organised by Clean Sky Academy members. Educational aspects, by organising and promoting dedicated events concerning students (e.g. annual lectures at academic establishments by Clean Sky representatives) to attract students\u00b4 interest in the Clean Sky Programme. An ambitious objective is to understand how technology transfer can be improved, or knowledge transfer to universities, so that the latest innovations appear as quickly as possible in the students\u2019 curriculum and in academic lectures. This is a challenge that must be taken up with both professors and students, which is also closely linked to the dissemination of results of the Clean Sky research. Promotional aspects, in particular by supporting the Clean Sky PhD Awards initiative, contributing to the evaluation of the submitted applications. Clean Sky is currently running the 5th edition of the Best PhD Award in Applied Sciences and Engineering in Aeronautics. Last year\u2019s ceremony was held in May 2019 at Aerodays in Bucharest. With this award, Clean Sky wants to underline the fact that our programme provides many opportunities to the students to perform high level research, in particular through the opportunity to perform a PhD. Research aspects, by providing inputs on how to maximise the value of academic input in the research activities in Clean Sky 2, including possible additional research topics (Thematic topics) in relation to the Clean Sky 2 high-level objectives and possible support actions (e.g. linked to dissemination and exploitation, analysis of and support to involvement of universities/research organisations in Clean Sky) to maximise the impact of Clean Sky actions. Clean Sky Academy and Horizon Europe? Upstream research is an essential component of the roadmap towards a \u2018Climate-Neutral Aviation\u2019 by 2050 in line with the European Green Deal. Many disruptive ideas are in the pipeline, with innovations in new aircraft configurations, new propulsion systems based on hybrid-electric architectures or even breakthrough technologies such as liquid hydrogen as a sustainable fuel for aviation. Academia and research centres have always been at the forefront of these promising research areas and Horizon Europe will undoubtedly be an opportunity to strengthen even further their involvement in our collective challenge to achieve the highest short-term impact in terms of mitigating climate change. \u00a0 Clean Sky Best PhD Award ceremony at Aerodays 2019, L-R: Dr Roberto Merino-Martinez (1st prize), Prof. Andreas Strohmayer (EASN), Dr Joel Serra (2nd prize), Prof. Mario Guggliano (Politecnico di Milano), Dr Francesco Rea (3rd prize), Dr Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Brouckaert (Clean Sky)\u00a0 ", "url": "https://www.cleansky.eu/news/the-clean-sky-academy-connecting-students-with-clean-aviation-innovation"}, {"id": "CLEANSKY_NEWS_0080", "date": "2020-07-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "And the winner is\u2026.", "text": "Drumroll please\u2026 announcing the winners of Clean Sky\u2019s Best PhD Award!\u00a0 Every year, Clean Sky evaluates PhD theses from some of the brightest young minds in aviation research and technology and presents the \u2018Best PhD award\u2019 to those that show the most promise for driving clean technology in aerospace.\u00a0 The award is part of the Clean Sky Academy \u2013 a Clean Sky initiative whose goal is to strengthen the link with academia and inspire young engineers to cast their eyes towards innovative solutions for greener aircraft.\u00a0 This year, despite COVID-19, 13 high-quality applications for the award were received. First place went to Dr Hossein Balaghi Enalou from the University of Nottingham for his thesis on \u201cElectric Power Transfer Concept for Improved Performance of Multi-spool Turbofan Jet Engine\u201d.\u00a0 According to Dr Enalou, his work has established an \u201celectrical bridge\u201d to circulate the desired amount of power between engine shafts, in order to decouple their speeds. He also developed a nonlinear modular engine model to study the impact of the Electric Power Transfer (EPT) on the engine performance. His work improved the engine performance significantly, resulting in a fuel consumption reduction of up to 2% and surge margin increase up to 5%.\u00a0 Dr Fedor Fomin of Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht (HZG) came second, with his work \u201cOn the fatigue behaviour and modelling of fatigue life for laser-welded Ti-6Al-4V\u201d. \u00a0His PhD aimed to accurately predict the fatigue behaviour of laser-welded/3D-printed titanium structures using a probabilistic model. During an aircraft\u2019s lifetime, the structural integrity of the aircraft degrades due to material defects or damages, so his work is critical to ensure safety and reliability and will ensure more realistic lifetime assessments of ageing fleets. And finally, Dr\u00a0Pedro Magalh\u00e3es de Oliveira of the University of Cambridge took third place with his thesis: \u201cIgnition and propagation mechanisms in kerosene spray flames\u201d. De Oliveira conducted a fundamental investigation of flame structure in sprays of conventional and renewable jet fuels, and used his findings to develop a mathematical design tool for relight in aviation combustors that has been transferred to industry. His work can be directly applied to the development of novel combustors and has contributed towards international efforts to streamline the process of alternative jetfuel certification. \u00a0 The \u2018Best PhD Award\u2019 will be officially presented online at a prize-giving ceremony to be held on 6 October.

Novel and disruptive aircraft, aero-engine and systems innovations in combination with hydrogen technologies can help to reduce the global warming effect of flying by 50 to 90%. Moreover, these innovations can help to meet the drastic reduction targets for aviation emissions set out in the EU Green Deal. A new independent study, commissioned by Clean Sky 2 and Fuel Cells & Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertakings on hydrogen\u2019s potential for use in aviation, was presented at an event on 22 June which featured Adina-Ioana V\u0103lean, the European Commissioner for Transport, and Patrick Child, Deputy Director-General of the Directorate-General for Research and Innovation at the European Commission, as keynote speakers, in addition to leading industry representatives St\u00e9phane Cueille (CTO, Safran), Glen Llewellyn (VP Zero Emissions Technology, Airbus), David Burns (VP Global Business Development, Linde), Per Ekdunge (Executive Vice-President, PowerCell) and Rolf Henke (Member of the Executive Board, German Aerospace Centre - DLR). The study found that hydrogen \u2013 as a primary energy source for propulsion, either for fuel cells, direct burn in thermal (gas turbine) engines or as a building block for synthetic liquid fuels \u2013 could feasibly power aircraft with entry into service by 2035 for short-range aircraft. Costing less than \u20ac18 [$20] extra per person on a short-range flight, and reducing climate impact by 50 to 90%, hydrogen could play a central role in the future mix of aircraft and propulsion technologies. Such disruptive innovation will require significant aircraft research and development, further development of fuel cell technology and liquid hydrogen tanks, and also investment into fleet and hydrogen infrastructure and accompanying regulations and certification standards to ensure safe, reliable and economic hydrogen-powered aircraft can take to the skies. Industry experts anticipate that it will take 10 to 15 years to make these important advancements, and consequently the research needs to start now. The study estimated that the first short-range hydrogen-powered demonstrator could be developed by 2028 if sufficient investments into R&I are made. The technical challenges and unique characteristics of hydrogen as an on-board energy source make it best suited to commuter, regional, short-range and medium-range aircraft. For the next decades, long-haul air travel is likely to be based on liquid hydrocarbon fuels; but increasingly these too will need to be sustainable and these \u2018drop-in\u2019 fuels will also rely on hydrogen for their production. According to the report, the following policy actions are needed: An aviation roadmap to guide the transition. This needs to set clear ambitions, align standards, coordinate infrastructure build-up, overcome market failures, and encourage first movers. A strong increase in long-term Research & Innovation (R&I) activities and funding. This would lead to legal and financial certainty for technology development. A long-term policy framework should lay out the rail guards for the sector, including how climate impact will be measured and how the roadmap will be implemented. Commissioner Adina-Ioana V\u0103lean says: \u201cHydrogen in aviation offers many opportunities for the\u00a0transformation of our aviation sector. From production, to distribution, to new aircraft designs and large scale use, it provides numerous opportunities for European companies to be at the forefront of our\u00a0industrial revolution in the years to come.\u201d \u201cResearch and innovation is vital to realise the full potential of hydrogen technologies for decarbonisation of aviation.\u00a0 The EU\u2019s future Horizon Europe research and innovation framework programme is a fantastic opportunity to advance this agenda, working in partnership with industry and the research community.\u00a0 The excellent co-operation between the existing Joint Undertakings dedicated to Hydrogen Fuel Cells and Clean Aviation illustrates the need for close synergies between the two sectors as we work together on the ambitious objectives of the post-COVID recovery and the European Green Deal\u201d, says Deputy Director-General for Research & Innovation Patrick Child. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to achieve climate-neutral aviation by 2050. Turning this ambition into reality requires the seamless integration of a range of important new technological advancements, one of which is hydrogen-powered aircraft. This comes hand in hand with priorities such as hybrid engines, more electric aircraft, ultra-efficient short- and medium-range aircraft and lighter airframes. The mix of these various game-changing technologies will help us to reach our final destination,\u201d says Axel Krein, Executive Director of Clean Sky 2 Joint Undertaking. \u201cThe cost of producing clean hydrogen came down in recent years thanks to cheaper renewable electricity and bigger and cheaper production technology. At the same time, fuel cell performance in terms of durability, capacity and cost has made big steps forward. This combination has now made it possible to look to such solutions for decarbonisation of the aviation industry and the results of the study are clear on the huge potential of hydrogen in aviation. The hydrogen and fuel cell sector is ready to work hand in hand with the aviation industry to design, test and produce the required components and make zero-emission aviation an everyday reality,\u201d says Bart Biebuyck, Executive Director of Fuel Cells & Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking. \u00a0 Read the full study \u00a0 Download the press release \u00a0 Watch the webinar replay ", "url": "https://www.cleansky.eu/news/hydrogen-powered-aviation-preparing-for-take-off"}, {"id": "CLEANSKY_NEWS_0088", "date": "2020-06-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Novel heating processes for better repairs explored in NEWCORT project", "text": "Clean Sky 2\u2019s NEWCORT project successfully developed new heating processes and equipment focused on the curing of new types of resins over geometrically complex structural elements (e.g. \u201cOmega\u201d stringers), which will help improve repairs.\u00a0 The project\u2019s most interesting result is AdaptHEAT: a series of equipment and associated methodology to enable curing of complex structures, according to most stringent temperature homogeneity requirements.\u00a0 Using NEWCORT innovative solutions, airlines and Maintenance Repair Overhaul centres (MROs) will be able to increase the range of composite repair applications, while reducing the overall repair time requirements, especially in terms of thermal surveys and preparations.

Industry consensus is that electrification is the direction that aviation must take towards making flight greener and more efficient. Indeed, there's been a lot of media coverage of electric and/or electric/hybrid powered aircraft in the future for regional aviation. For example, the Government of Norway announced last year its intention to mandate that all of its domestic flights will be electrically propelled by 2040. But in the nearer term future, electrification can be applied in many other important roles in aircraft, not just propulsion. Clean Sky's Energy Optimised Regional Aircraft project focuses specifically on six new on-board systems for the next generation of regional aircraft where innovative electrical solutions can save energy whilst lowering noise and emissions.

In January 2020 the latest demonstrator component, the TD 3 structure (a high-energy hydroformed and machined door), was delivered to Saab from the company 3D Metal Forming, part of the MISSP project led by Sonaca.\u00a0 The doors being explored provide a platform for new innovative design solutions but also serve as a demonstrator for new technologies, materials and manufacturing techniques applicable for generic airframe structures. A reduced environmental footprint for the aircraft industry is one of the key drivers for the technologies included in the project. Five door demonstrators will be manufactured. Three will be purely structural, showcasing new/upcoming metallic manufacture technologies and materials. Two will show a novel cargo door configuration with full functionality (opening, latching & locking systems); one of these will be a metallic solution and the other composite. Collaboration between Saab Aerostructures and Airbus will result in the demonstration of these functional cargo doors in representative metallic and composite fuselage sections. The structure recently delivered to Saab has an integrated skin, frames and stringers, greatly reducing the part count for a typical skeleton structure. Although hydroforming is not a new forming process, developments in automated high-speed machining over the last decade have made this type of integrated structure much more advantageous from a design, assembly, and cost perspective. The large reduction in the number of fasteners and sealant provides an efficient, lightweight structure with less complex stress calculations. The structure also has major advantages in terms of assembly and the tolerance variations typically seen when multiple parts are assembled together. \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure 1: Schematic for the cargo doors which will be manufactured and delivered in Clean Sky 2 together with partners \u00a0 The TD3 Structure will shortly be powder coated prior to the assembly of a 3D printed lift fitting in Scalmalloy which has already been provided by Fraunhofer in September 2019 (see figure 3). Powder coating has been selected here because aluminium alloys used in the aeronautics industry must have a sustainable corrosion protection system, taking environmental and health aspects into consideration. Powder coating is an environmentally-friendly top-coat and the complete protection system consists of chromate-free pre-treatment and minimum use of solvents. Powder coating is intended to be used for internal parts and has already been applied on a smaller demonstrator (see Figure 3), as this protection system is new for aircraft components. Christian Ulrich, Technology Manager for powder coating at Saab, explains some of the advantages of the protection system. \u201cPowder coating has many advantages compared to wet paint, for instance shorter lead time, improved coverage on complex parts, lower material cost, no solvents, less waste, and improved work environment for the operator.\u201d Figure 2:\u00a0Hydroformed (3D Metal Forming), machined aluminium 7050 test part which has been anodized, primed (green area) then powder coated (grey area) \u00a0 The additive manufacture of metallic load bearing parts has long been a goal for the aerospace industry, again making use of advances in computing power (topology optimisation) as well as advances in automated printing technologies and materials. The Scalmalloy demonstrator delivered to Saab in September by Fraunhofer will soon be assembled on the TD3 door demonstrator (see Figure 4). \u00a0 \u00a0 Figure 3:\u00a0Fraunhofer\u2019s Topology optimised 3D Printed Lift fitting \u00a0 New flexible and lightweight solutions for assembly tooling are a major part of Saab\u2019s projects scope: the final assembly jigs are intended to be lightweight (by using a composite material for the main jig), flexible and reconfigurable. Box joints, together with hexapods, are being used to demonstrate a level of flexibility not seen in traditional welded jigs. The same jig will be used for the assembly of all the doors (where assembly is required) which are all of slightly different sizes and geometries. A flexible jig enables lower assembly costs (only one jig required) whilst also offering an insight into how future production lines could look. Being able to accept multiple products in the same line, enabling late product modifications with minimal cost, and changing the orientation of parts in order to provide more beneficial orientations for a robot or operator, are just some examples. Figure 4: Current status of the flexible assembly tooling \u00a0 Samuel Schuster, Lead Design Engineer from Saab Aerostructures, has worked in the project for two years. \u201cWhat I like the most is the challenge of implementing new technical solutions in an industry as conservative as the commercial aeronautics industry, where old solutions are often chosen over new ones to ensure passenger safety. I have worked a lot with the development of the new electromechanically actuated latching mechanism of the door, where we use innovative solutions to reduce weight, thus making the aircrafts more fuel-efficient. This environmental aspect is highly motivating for me, since even small changes have a high impact on a global scale when it comes to reducing emissions, which is a key issue for both the industry and our planet in general.\u201d One of the ultimate goals of Saab\u2019s participation in Clean Sky 2 is to be able to clearly define when and where different manufacture technologies offer the biggest advantages either in terms of cost/weight savings, environmental benefits or other performance benefits.", "url": "https://www.cleansky.eu/news/lightweight-materials-and-efficient-manufacturing-bring-environmental-benefits-to-cargo-doors"}, {"id": "CLEANSKY_NEWS_0114", "date": "2020-02-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Thematic topics explored at Clean Sky\u2019s Intelligent Cockpit workshop", "text": "Thematic topics were the focus of a workshop on the future Intelligent Cockpit, organised on 5 February by Clean Sky and industry members including Airbus, Dassault, Honeywell and Thales.

The aim of the ERACLE project is to perform wind tunnel tests to collect accurate data and use it to verify and validate a toolset to design aircraft configurations for better acoustic performance. The ERACLE project is focusing on a pushing and wing mounted propeller-based propulsion. Pusher propellers are highly efficient at higher speeds, but this results in loud noise production. Therefore the installation of these pusher propellers is critical: installation at certain distances on the wing, or at certain proximities to the fuselage, can lead to various effects on the noise produced (near- and far-field). So a good knowledge of the acoustic propagation is essential, in order to determine which configurations are better suited to reduce noise: and this is where the ERACLE project comes in! The ERACLE consortium has now completed the design of the WT model, which will include innovative design features such as new sets of propeller blades, hub, spinner, fairings, shaft and suitable mechanisms for varying the propeller installation configuration; and a complete hardware/software system comprehensive of an electrical motor to drive the propellers. Planned to start in June 2020 in the acoustic large low speed wind tunnel of Pininfarina (the subcontractor of ERACLE for WT test services), the test campaign will look at installation configurations and the different kinds of aerodynamic flows generated by the wing through controlled boundary layers. This will enable the project engineers to collect and post-process WT test data in terms of near-field and far-field acoustic propagation, as well as to further develop and validate a fast engineering toolset for the preliminary design of propeller-wing arrangements vs. acoustic performance. Partners in the ERACLE project are: IBK for Coordination and WT model design; NHOE for WT model systems design leader; UNIROMA3 for acoustic pre-design toolset and WT test campaign management; and Eligio Re Fraschini (ERF) for WT model manufacturing, instrumentation and implementation in the WT.

As part of Clean Sky 2\u2019s Airframe technology platform, TAMI is contributing with ADS and the Core Partner project PASSARO to develop technologies compatible with Eco-Design requirements and objectives. TAMI is contributing to the Future Leakage Identification Systems (FUGAS) project, which aims to develop theoretical models, simulations and methods for the identification of leaks in aircraft systems. TAMI project coordinator TQC Ltd UK provide specialised automation solutions for industry, with particular expertise in leak testing. Within the TAMI project, TQC designed and built a versatile test bench with the ability to apply several contemporary leak testing methods on aircraft gas fluid systems (e.g. fire extinguisher, oxygen supply, rudder booster), fuel tanks and fuel systems in order to detect and quantify leakages. The TAMI test procedures are configurable, supporting test pressures of 0-200 bar (0 - 3000 psi) and volumes from 0.5 cm3 to 4000 litres. Of particular interest to the Topic Manager at ADS was the application of the tracer gas method. This involves pressurising the fluid system under test with air and a small dose of helium, sufficient for a \u2018sniffer\u2019 to detect close to a leak point. Currently, many of the leakage tests on aircraft systems are performed using the fluid for which the system is designed. Some of these system fluids, like hydraulic fluid and fuel, are costly, highly polluting and toxic. The TAMI leak test methods are cleaner and cheaper. The tests at ADS validated the TAMI bench as a compact unit that can be used flexibly to test a range of aircraft systems. Notably, these methods demonstrated the feasibility to make on-ground leak testing more efficient, ecological and faster in aircraft assembly and maintenance, reducing costs, time to market and toxic wastes in line with the aims of Clean Sky.

The advantages of ALM include quicker design and manufacturing: complex engine parts with multiple pieces can be manufactured in fewer parts or even as a single complete part, improving lead times and allowing components to be redesigned quickly and easily during the development phase. ALM also increases production efficiency and reduces component weight. Meanwhile CMCs are lighter than metal alternatives and can withstand higher temperatures for longer, contributing to improved efficiency. To date, engineers have downloaded millions of data points from the tests, which began last November and saw the engine achieve full power in July 2018. The Advance3 demonstrator is testing a new engine core that will deliver optimum fuel efficiency and low emissions.

The project, which is run by the Belgian company EHP as partner and Airbus DS as Topic Manager, was tested at EHP premises near Brussels. The project\u2019s objective is to obtain a competitive ice protection system in terms of weight while minimising energy requirements by application of the highly efficient and passive biphasic capillary pumping heat transport technology. The biphasic capillary pumping technology, developed initially for space application, is characterised by 1) high capacity of heat transport between a heat source and a heat sink, and 2) no need of external power nor moving parts to move the fluid transporting the heat. It basically consists of five parts: 1) evaporator, 2) fluid reservoir, 3) condenser, 4) fluid transport lines and 5) fluid to transport the heat between evaporator and condenser. It operates passively by means of the capillary forces generated in a metallic porous structure (called \u201cwick\u201d) embedded in the evaporator when liquid is transformed to vapor. Two major variants exist, the so-called Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) and the Capillary Pumped Loop (CPL), with the difference between the two being the fact that the reservoir is attached to the evaporator (LHP) and not (CPL). The fluid reservoir defines the working point of the fluid circulating in the loop. The major challenges of the project are the \u201cwick\u201d capillary pumping capacity in order to cope the positive acceleration forces which are present in aircraft and not in space application, the maximum temperature of the heat source (in this case 250 deg C) while typically it does not exceed 100 deg C, and the integration of the condensing lines inside a geometrically complex structure like a chin type engine air intake. The recent test is crucial in terms of validating the analytical performances model of the system prior to construction of the system to be fitted in engine air intake and nacelle mockup, which will be tested in Icing Wind Tunnel at Rail Tech Arsenal in Austria in the Clean Sky 2 project I3PS (Integrated Innovative Ice Protection System) by the beginning of 2020.", "url": "https://www.cleansky.eu/news/pips-project-for-innovative-ice-protection-system-passes-first-tests"}, {"id": "CLEANSKY_NEWS_0219", "date": "2018-09-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "First lessons learned for Clean Sky 2 project on effects of using VR headsets on-board", "text": "Clean Sky 2\u2019s Immersive Cabin Project (IMCA), studying the effects of wearing virtual reality and augmented reality headsets by airplane passengers, was put to the test for the first time last week. The project, led by NLR, is looking at how using a VR headset affects passengers in response to safety, on-board service, experience and comfort. Last week\u2019s test, which took place in a KLM cabin simulator at Schiphol-East, saw a group of forty KLM volunteers and a crew being exposed to various flight scenarios, such as a calm flight and turbulence, while either viewing a presentation on a VR headset or on their smartphone. During the tests, the cabin crew found they had to make more effort to communicate with those passengers wearing the headsets; it was particularly noted during the turbulence simulation that many headset wearers were unaware of any emergency at all. The passengers\u2019 responses, recorded on video and through a questionnaire, are still to be analysed, but the tests seem to confirm the researchers\u2019 hypothesis that wearing a VR headset affects communications between crew and passengers, leading to negative consequences for on-board services and even safety.

Keynote speakers included Tom\u00e1\u0161 Novotn\u00fd, Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic; Clara de la Torre, Director of Transport in DG RTD, European Commission; and Christian Ehler, Member of the European Parliament. A second panel of speakers was made up of Mateusz Gaczy\u0144ski, Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Poland; Nathalie Errard, Senior Vice President of Airbus; Katja Reppel, Deputy Head of Unit for Regional\u00a0 Policy, European Commission; and Joeri De Ruytter, R&T Business Development and Partnerships, Honeywell. Main interventions focused on the importance of visible impact of EU aeronautics programmes to show their value to citizens, and that by financing research and innovation in the aviation sector, a stronger industry and ecosystem is created with a greater socio-economic impact. Concrete Clean Sky achievements were highlighted, including the BLADE flight demonstration on 26 September in Tarbes, France. As part of the keynote session, Clara de la Torre mentioned the mobility package recently published by the Commission and its links with clean and competitive technologies. She also mentioned the ongoing review work in the Commission based on the \u201cevolutionary\u201d recommendations from the High Level Experts Group chaired by Pascal Lamy, such as the mission-oriented R&I with a clear and trans-disciplinary impact. She stressed the importance of the EU and Member States working together and pooling efforts in aviation, as well as the need to show the impact of R&I funded research on citizens\u2019 daily lives and the importance of a sound regulatory framework. Finally, she highlighted being proud of Clean Sky\u2019s results so far. Christian Ehler elaborated on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and political budget negotiations for post-2020, warning about the implications of Brexit for the JTIs and the need to have a clear framework as soon as possible. He also touched on Europe\u2019s level of ambition for the next Framework Programme, as well as the issue of the innovation gap in Europe which must be addressed and in which JTIs can play a role. He stressed the importance of a continuation of Clean Sky under the next Framework Programme, noting that Clean Sky is working effectively on synergies with ESIF with Member States and Regions, such as the Czech Republic, to contribute to more coordinated investments in R&I in aviation. Tom\u00e1\u0161 Novotn\u00fd emphasised the importance of aviation as a growing sector in Czech Republic by showing figures on turnover and job creation. He highlighted the positive cooperation with Clean Sky under the MoU signed in 2016 and announced a national thematic call in aviation to support complementarities with the Clean Sky 2 programme. He also stressed the importance of re-orientating the stakeholders to European programmes in light of a possible reduction of funds under the future cohesion policy. Looking to the future, a number of challenges facing the European aeronautics industry were touched upon by the panel discussion including the level of ambition that the future Framework Programme and possible Clean Sky 3 should have; important technology topics such as the electrification of aircraft and the increasing digitalisation of the sector; and the emergence of new competitors such as Brazil and China. It was emphasised that this is an integrated sector with spill-over from aerospace and defence, and an integrated industry effort in a global competition. It was also mentioned that the pace of innovation in Europe must be stepped up in order not to fall behind and that EU financing through Public-Private Partnerships is crucial for this, with Clean Sky being a fundamental pillar: not just a bridge for innovation, but an accelerator. \u00a0Although the future of EU financing for the aviation sector is still unknown, considering the dimension of Brexit and future cohesion policy, several speakers noted that financing should continue to focus on mobilising activities around missions and working across disciplines and borders to truly have a positive impact on citizens\u2019 lives. \u00a0 Read the press release from the debate here View speakers\u2019 presentations here", "url": "https://www.cleansky.eu/news/eu-financing-of-research-and-innovation-in-aeronautics-post-2020"}, {"id": "CLEANSKY_NEWS_0264", "date": "2017-10-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Eric Dautriat wins CEAS Gold Medal Award", "text": "Eric Dautriat, former Executive Director of Clean Sky, has received the CEAS Gold Medal Award for outstanding contributions to the aeronautical sciences.

Although this is a huge opportunity for the European economy, it also creates environmental obligations for manufacturers and airlines and triggers the appearance of new competitors from emerging countries. Therefore it is all the more necessary for the European industry to keep its competitive edge through innovation. This is where Clean Sky comes in. By fostering and coordinating research and innovation, innovative technologies can be developed and integrated into full-scale demonstrators in order to reach a high readiness level for future implementation into new products. The socio-economic impact of the Clean Sky initiative is measured also through the acceleration it provides to the time to market of new products stemming from its successful technical activities and the consequent fall-out on the number of production jobs it creates. Clean Sky 1 started in 2008 and counts over 600 participating entities from 24 countries, including SMEs, research centres and academia. With one year still to go, Clean Sky is already delivering demonstrators resulting in significant reductions in CO2, gas emissions and noise levels with clear socio-economic benefits for society at large.
