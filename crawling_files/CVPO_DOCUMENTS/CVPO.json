It is based on the findings of a Commission study on\u00a0new genomic techniques. The aim is to maintain a high level of protection for human and animal health and the environment, enable innovation in the agri-food system and contribute to the goals of the European Green Deal and the \u2018Farm to Fork\u2019 strategy. This roadmap is open for feedback for\u00a04 weeks. Feedback will be taken into account for further development and fine tuning of the initiative.

It has been a great honour to serve the European Union in this role and a real pleasure to manage the EU plant variety protection system during the past decade. Plant breeding has never been as important as it is today. It offers tremendous benefits to society in terms of food security, resilience and environmental sustainability. Plant variety rights entail a crucial incentive for breeders to create and innovate and I am happy that the EU plant variety protection system serves this purpose very well. I believe that the inclusive and transparent approach of the CPVO governance is a major reason for its success. In that respect, I wish to thank the EU Member States, the European Commission, the examination offices, the observers to the Administrative Council (UPOV and EUIPO), and of course the breeders, for the frequent and constructive feedback ensuring that the EU system remains a centre of excellence. It has been a true privilege to work with so many outstanding colleagues, peers, friends, institutional and business stakeholders. I wish to express my gratitude to all CPVO partners and country representatives in the EU and beyond its borders with whom the CPVO has been fostering formal collaboration, sharing knowledge and promoting an efficient PVP system based on the 1991 UPOV Convention. I will be leaving the CPVO with a clear conscience knowing that the most valuable asset of the agency, the dedicated groups of professionals I have had the pleasure to work with, will remain after my departure. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my colleagues for their professionalism, commitment and eagerness to deliver at the highest standards possible to the satisfaction of the applicants and all stakeholders. From a practical standpoint, the recruitment process for the appointment of a new President is underway but the new President will not be appointed in time to start his/her duties on 1 September 2021. Accordingly, Francesco Mattina, in his capacity of Vice-President, will take over all the President\u2019s duties as of Wednesday 1 September 2021 until the appointment of the new President.

Pursuant to the CPVO Business Continuity Plan, the end of crisis shall be declared once the event has been efficiently managed by the crisis management team or the incident is over. This decision refers to the way the CPVO deals internally with COVID-19 related matters, after the CPVO switched to a crisis management mode and set up a crisis team (i.e. the BCP team) in March 2020 in order to monitor closely the situation and take a series of exceptional measures for our stakeholders and staff members. At this stage of the pandemic, where COVID-related matters have become routine and where opening-up measures and massive vaccination campaigns are being implemented by national governments, it has been considered appropriate to revert to a normal management mode. As of 14 June 2021, the CPVO BCP team will no longer meet and the CPVO management team will therefore address all future questions and take all necessary decisions, both internal and external, relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the fact that there is a duty under the CPVO Business Continuity Plan to inform stakeholder when the decision on end of crisis is taken, we wanted to share this information, so that you are kept abreast in full transparency of CPVO\u2019s latest operational decisions.

The new Administrative Arrangement with a duration of five years is an opportunity to reinforce the collaboration in Plant Variety Protection (PVP) and to continue the fruitful exchange that started almost 5 years ago. During the signing ceremony that took place virtually, Martin Ekvad, President of the CPVO, said: \u201cThe cooperation between the EU & China on IP policies has advanced in the recent years, and this is good for innovators, businesses and consumers in both the European Union and China. Policies on plant variety rights are no exception. European breeders show an ever increasing interest to invest in China and applications are made in China for many species.\u201d \u201cAt the time when an EU breeder makes an application in China, a DUS report has in most cases already been established in the EU for the same variety. Breeders advocate that reports from the EU can be accepted in China in line with the guidelines for technical cooperation between UPOV members\u201d. \u201cI believe that during the implementation of the Administrative Arrangement signed today, we can develop the \u201ctake-over\u201d cooperation further. These are concrete deliverables that will decrease administration for the innovators whilst at the same time ensuring high quality DUS testing.\u201d By signing the Administrative Arrangement, the three agencies show that there is a strong commitment to strengthen their cooperation and to work together so that the scope\u00a0 of protection of plant varieties rights will be the same in the EU and in China. This will not only be to the benefit of breeders, but also farmers, producers and in the end the consumers and citizens. After the ceremony, a meeting was held during which CPVO, DCST-MARA and STDC-NFGA discussed the continued technical cooperation. It was agreed to follow up on possibilities and challenges as regards taking over reports between the three institutions in line with UPOV principles. Such cooperation would benefit the industry by avoiding multiple testing of the same variety and ultimately provide access to the breeding progress to the growers and consumers in Europe and China. Another topic discussed amongst the participants concerned the activities planned for the end of the year, notably a DUS on-line training and a virtual PVP Awareness Raising Seminar. It was also agreed to continue an exchange in relation to questions raised by the Chinese sides on matters related to how certain provisions under the UPOV 1991 Act have been implemented in the EU PVP system.", "url": "https://cpvo.europa.eu/en/news-and-events/news/cpvo-signs-new-administrative-arrangement-chinese-counterparts"}, {"id": "CVPO_NEWS_0016", "date": "2021-04-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Publication of the CPVO centralised Register of Data Protection Records", "text": "As from 15 April 2021, the CPVO counts on a publicly accessible centralised Register of Records of processing activities being carried out within the remit of the Office where personal data are processed.

During the meeting, the members of the Administrative Council elected their new Chair and Deputy Chair for the period 2020 - 2023. The new Chair is Mr. Marien Valstar from The Netherlands, who was previously Deputy Chair, and the new Deputy Chair is Dr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Sobrino Mat\u00e9, from Spain.

Coming from a country with a long standing history of plant breeding and seeing the benefits to society stemming from investments in this area, I hope to be able to contribute to the EU PVP system in my capacity as Chair\u201d, explained Marien Valstar. \u201cThe election of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Sobrino Mat\u00e9, from Spain, as the new Deputy Chair of the CPVO Administrative Council, is an equally positive news. Juan Antonio is responsible for the Spanish Plant Variety Protection system and Spain is an important country in terms of breeding activities in the EU\u201d, said Martin Ekvad. \u201cSpain\u2019s know-how in testing new plant varieties is recognised globally, and Spanish authorities are entrusted by the CPVO to test many agricultural, vegetable and fruit crops in over a dozen testing facilities spread out throughout the country. In addition, Spain has the exclusive competence, capacity and entrustment to examine citrus in Valencia\u201d, he concluded.

We would like to kindly remind all concerned stakeholders and plant breeders that the measures laid out in the decision of 27 April have come to an end on Monday 21 September 2020. As a result, we would like to confirm to all applicants and right-holders with outstanding unpaid fees that the CPVO is now reverting to the one-month deadline for payment after the reminder date. In practice, what does it means if you have outstanding fees falling outside the scope of the CPVO decision of 27 April? Unpaid Annual Fees Whenever the payment of an annual fee is not received within one month of the date of a reminder sent by the CPVO, the CPVO will cancel the Community Plant Variety Right(s) for the relevant variety(ies) - in accordance with article 21(2)(c) of Council Regulation N\u00b0 2100/94(b). A cancellation for non-payment of the annual fee(s) will be published in the Office\u2019s Official Gazette. Unpaid Examination Fees Whenever the payment of an examination is not made within one month of the date of of a reminder sent by the CPVO, the CPVO will cancel the examination(s) in question. As a consequence, please be informed that the CPVO will refuse the application and, despite that, the examination fee(s) remain due. Background On 27 April 2020 the President took a Decision on the extension of time limits in proceedings before the CPVO which entered into force on 4 May 2020 regarding the payment of fees for technical examinations and of annual fees, pursuant to Article 8 and 9 of Commission Regulation (EC) 1238/95 (the Fees Regulation). As from the date of entry into force, this Decision repealed and replaced completely a previous decision taken on 24 March and amended on 6 April. The Office continued to send debit notes for the aforementioned fees and applicants were encouraged to pay their fees in due time. However, for all outstanding debit notes regarding annual fees or examination fees with a due date for payment until 21 September 2020 inclusive, that have not been settled in due time, the Office decided to send a reminder with a three months deadline to pay the fee. Until the end of this three-month period, the Office decided to not launch the related procedure for cancellation of titles due to unpaid annual fees. Accordingly, the Office decided to not cancel the arrangements for a technical examination, or stop any ongoing technical examination or launch a procedure for the refusal of applications before the said three-month deadline has expired.", "url": "https://cpvo.europa.eu/en/news-and-events/news/cpvos-exceptional-measures-extend-time-limits-payments-come-end"}, {"id": "CVPO_NEWS_0028", "date": "2020-08-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The cascade of protection in relation to parent lines and hybrids and the relevance of the breeders\u2019 exemption", "text": "The analysis\u00a0outlined on this page represents\u00a0the view of the CPVO in relation to the scope of protection extended from the parental lines to the hybrids and the potential use of such hybrid for the breeding of other varieties in relation to the breeders\u2019 exemption. The following question has been analysed by the CPVO: Can holder 1 of varieties A and B prevent breeder 2 from the repeated use of a single hybrid H in the breeding of a new 3 -way hybrid variety Z?

A Community plant variety right shall have the effect that the holder or holders of the Community plant variety right, hereinafter referred to as 'the holder', shall be entitled to effect the acts set out in paragraph 2. 2. Without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 15 and 16, the following acts in respect of variety constituents, or harvested material of the protected variety, both referred to hereinafter as 'material', shall require the authorization of the holder: (a) production or reproduction (multiplication); (b) conditioning for the purpose of propagation; (c) offering for sale; (d) selling or other marketing; (e) exporting from the Community; (f) importing to the Community; (g) stocking for any of the purposes mentioned in (a) to (f). The holder may make his authorization subject to conditions and limitations. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 to 4 shall also apply in relation to: \u00a0(c) varieties whose production requires the repeated use of the protected variety. Article 15:\u00a0Limitation of the effects of Community plant variety rights The Community plant variety rights shall not extend to: \u00a0(c) acts done for the purpose of breeding, or discovering and developing other varieties; Analysis According to Art. 15. c) of the Basic Regulation the effects of CPVR are limited in the case of \u201cacts done for the purpose of breeding or discovering and developing other varieties\u201d. The so called breeder\u2019s exemption allows thus free access to protected varieties for the development therefrom and exploitation of new varieties. In this respect, the Basic Regulation does not impose any limitation in the application of this exception to hybrids. Indeed, under the breeder\u2019s exemption any variety can be used to breed and develop another variety. The fact that one of the parent varieties to the \u00a0variety Z is a hybrid itself does not limit the applicability of the breeder\u2019s exemption. The above scheme shows that breeder 2 uses the hybrid H to make a \u00a0new 3-way hybrid Z. Therefore it is a different variety bred and developed under the breeder\u2019s exemption. It could be concluded, then, that the protection \u00a0of a hybrid would not prevent the use of said hybrid for the creation of a new variety by a third party. Does it make a difference if the single hybrid H is protected through the protection of its parental lines or if it is protected in its own right? In the opinion of the CPVO Article 15(c) of the Basic Regulation (the breeder\u2019s exemption) applies equally regardless of whether H is protected through its parent lines or if it enjoys protection in its own right.\u00a0 However, it should be noted that variety H cannot be multiplied without the authorization of holder 1 pursuant to Article 13(2)(a) of the Basic Regulation. \u00a0 Disclaimer: The scope of protection is determined by national courts, and in the end, by the Court of Justice of the EU. The opinion of the CPVO is not binding on courts and it is up to each market player to assess what action s/he deems appropriate to take.", "url": "https://cpvo.europa.eu/en/news-and-events/news/cascade-protection-relation-parent-lines-and-hybrids-and-relevance-breeders-exemption"}, {"id": "CVPO_NEWS_0043", "date": "2020-08-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Announcement n\u25e6 4/2020 of the Community Plant Variety Office.

The Decision is applicable as of 4 May 2020 and concerns the deadlines for the payment of the annual fee (Article 9 fees regulation) and the payment of examinations fees (Article 8 fees regulation). Any other time limits regarding proceedings with the CPVO are not affected by this decision. In practice users are encouraged to pay all invoices for annual fees and fees for technical examinations within the normal deadlines. However, if a user is unable to pay the mentioned fee(s) he/she will have three months to pay it from the date of the reminder, instead of one month in normal times. The extension of these time limits shall apply to outstanding debit notes with a due date for payment until 21 September 2020 included. As regards requests for the postponement of submitting plant material for DUS tests, the Office will assess such requests bearing in mind that users may face severe limitations to their activities and communications capabilities across the EU and world-wide. \u201cThe covid19 pandemic is certainly the biggest disruptor of the century for businesses across Europe, and in specific for SMEs. The CPVO acknowledges the difficult situation for the whole plant breeding sector. Breeders, in particular in the ornamental sector, have been hit directly, and their business activities have been severely hampered and jeopardized\u201d, said Martin Ekvad, President of CPVO. \u201cIn these extraordinary circumstances, the CPVO has decided to adopt a more lenient approach as regards the deadlines of payment for annual fees and examination fees - which are extended to three months. We hope that this decision will enable breeders to maintain their plant variety right titles in force and will relieve some unnecessary stress, so that they can keep innovating and producing new plant varieties for the benefit of society. We will also continue to be lenient when deciding on the requests for the extensions of time limits to submit\u00a0plant material for DUS tests\u201d, he concluded.

Background A Decision of the President of 24 March 2020 as amended on 6 April 2020, was taken with the aim of extending time limits expiring between 17 March 2020 and 3 May 2020 inclusive in the context of the coronavirus outbreak. On 27 April 2020 the President took a new Decision (the Decision) on the extension of time limits in proceedings before the CPVO which enters into force on 4 May 2020 regarding the payment of fees for technical examinations and of annual fees, pursuant to Article 8 and 9 of Commission Regulation (EC) 1238/95 (the Fees Regulation).\u00a0As from the date of entry into force, this Decision repeals and replaces completely the previous decision. The Office will continue to send debit notes for the aforementioned\u00a0fees and applicants are encouraged to pay their fees in due time. However, for all outstanding debit notes regarding annual fees or examination fees with a due date for payment until 21 September 2020 inclusive, that have not been settled in due time, the Office will send a reminder with a three months deadline to pay the fee. Until the end of this three-month period, the Office will not launch the related procedure for cancellation of titles due to unpaid annual fees. Accordingly, the Office will not cancel the arrangements for a technical examination, or stop any ongoing technical examination or launch a procedure for the refusal of applications before the said three-month deadline has expired. In addition, plant material submissions for the commencement of DUS testing work at examination offices that are due before 21 September 2020 may be delayed upon request for one year (request to be made to the CPVO before the submission deadline). If technically feasible however, a delay can be granted for a short period of time which would allow the DUS test to be conducted in the current growing period. An updated Explanatory Note\u00a0is\u00a0available in English and\u00a0in several other languages to provide further guidance on the time limits affected by the aforementioned extension, the nature of the extension and the measures to adapt communications sent to users.

For more info, click here.\u00a0 On 6 April 2020 the President of the Community Plant Variety Office has taken a new decision concerning the extension of time limits for proceedings before the CPVO that fall in the period 17 March \u2013 3 May included. The new decision amends and replaces the previous decision published on 24 March, with the view to include deadlines for the payment of examination fees. Please note that we have removed the decision taken on 24 March, as well as the previous explanatory note to applicants, from the CPVO website given that the decision and explanatory note of 6 April take\u00a0precedence. Examination fees were not part of the decision on 24 March 2020 since the financial risk to include such fees were hard to assess on short notice. The CPVO has now made an assessment and has concluded that there is indeed a financial risk involved for the CPVO since the CPVO must pay the Examination Office for certain technical examination even if the application in the end is abandoned. The CPVO is however prepared to take such a risk for a limited period of time. The Decision should contribute for parties to proceedings who need to make the necessary practical arrangements such as taking bridging loans and adapting their working methods in line with measures adopted by health authorities across the European Union. The extensions apply in specific to: Payment of the application fee Payment of fees relating to technical examinations Payment of the annual fee Payment of fees for processing specific requests and fees laid down by the President Payment of Appeal fees Right of Priority Filing of a Notice of Appeal and of the Statement of Grounds The extensions do not apply to: Time limits regarding the starting of technical examinations Submission of plant material for the conduct of technical examinations by Examination Offices Compliance with the novelty requirement Proceedings before other Authorities Time limits related to other subjects - i.e. subjects not dealt with by the Basic Regulation, the Proceedings Regulation or\u00a0the Fees Regulation (such as employment or procurement and grants) or which relate to other matters (e.g. the governance of the Office).

Therefore, you are advised to consult this section regularly. The information below was last updated on 7 April 2020.\u00a0You can also download this FAQ in French, Italian, German, Spanish and Dutch at the bottom of this webpage.\u00a0 \u00a0 Question\u00a01: Postponement of technical examination If I have a problem to submit material within the time-limit to submit plant material, can the DUS-test be postponed? Answer:\u00a0Yes, but you must send a written request to the CPVO before the end of the regular plant submission period. You should ask the CPVO\u00a0for a short delay if you want the DUS-test to be carried out in the current growing period or\u00a0for the test to be postponed for one year. In the event that a short delay for plant submission has already been accepted by the CPVO for a DUS-test, a request for postponement of the DUS-test\u00a0to the following growing period can still be made until the end of the agreed short delay. \u00a0 Question 2: Extension to pay the fee for the technical examination If I manage to submit material in time for it to be DUS-tested in the current growing period, can I get an extension to pay the fee for the technical examination? Answer:\u00a0You should try to pay the examination fee by the due date referred to in the debit note issued by the CPVO. If you are not able to do so, the Decision on the extension of time limits allows for the postponement of this fee until 4 May 2020. \u00a0 Question 3:\u00a0Extension to pay the fee for the technical examination to the next growing season If the DUS-test is postponed to the following growing season, when shall I pay the fee for the technical examination? Answer:\u00a0The obligation to pay the fee for the technical examination will be postponed until the following growing season. \u00a0 Question 4:\u00a0Applicable amount of examination fee following new fees as from 1 April 2020 If the DUS-test is postponed, which amount of the examination fee will I be charged? Answer:\u00a0The amount of examination fees changed on 1 April 2020. The CPVO will apply the amount of the examination fee according to the date of application when the candidate variety was filed to the CPVO, and not when the DUS-test actually starts. \u00a0 Question 5: Priority in case my variety is tested a year after another non-distinct variety If my candidate variety has benefitted from a postponement of DUS-testing to the following growing season, what guarantees do I have that another very similar variety with a later application date (\u201clater variety\u201d) but with the DUS test started in 2020, will not be declared distinct from my variety (\u201cearlier variety\u201d)? Answer:\u00a0The CPVO already has a policy in place on any postponement of DUS-testing, whereby the application date of candidate varieties takes precedent in the decision on distinctness. If a positive technical report had been issued for the \u201clater variety\u201d, following a DUS test in 2020 and a grant of Community plant variety rights were to follow, then the CPVO would have to review its decision. Both the similar varieties would have to be grown in the DUS trial in the following growing season (2021) for the \u201cearlier variety\u201d; if they turned out not to be distinct, then the \u201cearlier variety\u201d would receive a positive technical report, whilst the \u201clater variety\u201d would be reissued with a negative technical report. If a Community plant variety right had already been granted for the \u201clater variety\u201d, then the title would be declared null and void.", "url": "https://cpvo.europa.eu/en/news-and-events/news/extension-time-limits-proceedings-cpvo-because-covid-19"}, {"id": "CVPO_NEWS_0057", "date": "2020-04-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Change in CPVO fees regulation as of 1st April 2020", "text": "IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR\u00a0PLANT BREEDERS - We would like to inform all applicants that a decision was taken by the European Commission in 2019 to update the CPVO fees regulation. This decision has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union\u00a0on 29 November 2019.\u00a0 The most significant update concerns examination fees, which are linked to the costs the CPVO pays examination offices for technical examinations. These fees were adjusted to match the real costs of the technical examinations per group category. The new\u00a0fees are applicable as of 1st April 2020. What has changed on 1st April 2020? For all applications with an application date on 1st April 2020 or later, the following fees are applicable: Application fees: whilst online application fees remain unchanged (EUR 450), paper-based applications now costs EUR 800 instead of EUR 650 previously. Applicants benefiting from the online fee shall only receive electronic communications with the CPVO during the entire application procedure. Examination fees: examination fees are adjusted to reflect the real costs charged by the Examination Offices for each group category \u2013 as per the table available below.

Whilst revenues generated by annual fees are relatively stable, revenues generated by application fees and examination fees vary significantly from year to year. As regards costs, the principal component are the examination costs and costs for staff. The CPVO aims to set fees in order to have a balanced budget, and also to respect its Administrative Council decision that the free reserve should be of the order of 50% of the payments budget. In this respect, fees payable to the CPVO by applicants should be reviewed every 4 years. In March 2019, the CPVO Administrative Council invited the European Commission to update the fees regulation to ensure full cost recovery for technical examinations and to keep the annual fees unchanged (Regulation (EC) No 1238/95).

The seminar took place in Tartu, Estonia, and was organised in collaboration with the Estonian Ministry of Rural Affairs and the Estonian Agricultural Board with the aim to discuss the current practices in the Baltic region and inform farmers about the practicalities and obligations of the Farm-Saved-Seed mechanism. The use of FSS is widely spread among farmers in Estonia and it looks like plant breeders have difficulties to access accurate information on the scale of the varieties and the amount of seeds from protected varieties being saved. It was therefore important to give the opportunity to farmers and plant breeders to receive information and exchange views on the FSS concept. \u201cFarm Saved Seed is a legal provision enshrined in the basic regulation on Community Plant Variety Rights and the Implementing Rules on the Agricultural Exemption\u201d, said Francesco Mattina, Vice-President of the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO). \u201cTo be workable and serve its purpose, the FSS mechanism requires trust and mutual understanding from both the farming community and the breeders, and it is important to raise awareness and clarify how FSS works\u201d, he added. \u201cEven though practices on FSS differ across Europe, it is noticeable that FSS works well whenever there is clarity on the FSS mechanism and when its benefits are well understood: on the one hand, farmers get more value for using varieties which are of better yield, performance and quality; on the other hand, breeders get equitable remuneration for their innovation\u201d, he concluded. FSS was conceived to safeguard agricultural production and to guarantee a fair remuneration to plant breeders who have invested in developing new plant varieties. Farmers may use seeds that have been saved from protected varieties of certain species grown on their own holding for re-sowing on their own holding. \u00a0 Plant breeders\u2019 rights give the breeders legal rights over the plant varieties they have developed and allow them to charge royalties for using these protected varieties. Farmers must declare their use of FSS of protected varieties and pay to the title holders an equitable remuneration for their use. Clarity and cooperation between farmers and breeders on the implementation of the right for information is to be encouraged with the view to exercise compliance with the FSS mechanism and consider litigation as a last resort only. From the CPVO experience, there is a higher rate of compliance and acceptance of the value of plant breeding innovation by the farmers in countries where FSS agreements between farmer organisations and breeders associations have been negotiated and established.\u00a0 In practical terms, the development of new plant varieties of high quality is the result of costly R&D investments aiming at improving the yield, performance and quality of agricultural crops. Breeding innovation is constantly needed to fit with today\u2019s global demand and challenges, such as a growing demography and changing climatic conditions leading to the loss of arable land surface and a more sustainable use of water. \u201cThe CPVO\u2019s role is to ensure usefulness and efficiency of the Community Plant Variety Right (CPVR) system, bearing in mind that a strong Plant Variety Protection system creates an incentive for breeders to develop better varieties from which farmers can profit. This leads to a win-win situation\u201d said Dirk Theobald, CPVO\u2019 Senior Advisor Background information About the seminar: the agenda, a photo gallery and the presentations used during the seminar can be consulted on the CPVO seminar webpage.\u00a0 About Farm Saved Seed: the legal framework for Farm Saved Seed in the European Union are set in the Council Regulation No 2100/94 on Community Plant Variety Rights (article 14) and the Commission Regulation No 1768/95 detailing the Implementing Rules on the Agricultural Exemption.

The report puts intellectual property related to plant varieties in the spotlight. Plant breeding can play an important role in increasing productivity and quality in agriculture, whilst minimising the pressure on the environment. The EU wants to encourage investment and research in this area, including in the development of new crops resistant to drought, flood, heat and salinity to better respond to the negative consequences of climate change. Protection of plant varieties becomes therefore one of the Commission priorities in the coming period. As outlined by the European Commission, while developments have taken place since the publication of the previous report, concerns persist and a number of areas for improvement and action remain to be addressed. Intellectual property rights infringements worldwide cost European firms billions of euros in lost revenue and put thousands of jobs at risk. Today's report identifies three groups of countries on which the EU will focus its action: 1) China; 2) India, Indonesia, Russia, Turkey, Ukraine; 3) Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Malaysia, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Thailand. For the first time, a separate annex is dedicated to the protection and enforcement of plant variety rights. This is justified by the importance of the protection of plant varieties in the context of global environmental challenges, as well as by their high exposure to IPR infringements. Many EU plant varieties are reportedly suffering from weak protection and abuses in third countries with important economic losses for EU breeders and the consequent loss of incentives for further investment and research in this area. Improved yield, more efficient use of nutrients, resistance to plant pests and diseases, salt and drought tolerance and better adaptation to climatic stress are some of the features that allow breeders of new plant varieties to increase productivity and quality in agriculture, horticulture and forestry, whilst minimizing the pressure on the environment.\u00a0 As far as the protection and enforcement of plant variety rights are concerned, EU breeders face problems which can be grouped as follows: lack of effective plant variety rights legislation (in accordance with the 1991 Act of the UPOV Convention); absence of UPOV membership; difficulties in implementing effective administrative proceedings by designated national authorities; and lack of an effective system for the collection and enforcement of royalties at both judicial and administrative levels.

As of 1 January 2020, the new fee for PCS technical examination will be 2020\u20ac per growing period. On 3 September 2019, the CPVO and Naktuinbouw revised the Designation Agreement and thereby adjusted the level of remuneration that the CPVO pays to Naktuinbouw for testing pharmaceutical Cannabis varieties (PCS). Following this adjustment the CPVO decided to change the technical examination fee that applicants pay to the CPVO for PCS varieties in order to reflect more fairly the conditions and costs of the technical examination. In practice, the CPVO moved PCS from fee group 4 (\u201cother agricultural species\u201d) to fee group 8 (\u201cspecies with living reference collection, requiring cultivation in greenhouse\u201d). One reason for the move is that PCS\u2019 testing facilities require the same testing environment \u2013as defined in fee group 8 and, in addition, a secured greenhouse requiring cultivation permit from the Dutch Health ministry. Another reason is the growing popularity of the PCS over the years. Back in 2014, the number of PCS applications was marginal and the CPVO placed PCS in fee group 4, with a view to enter a piloting phase. The fees for applicants was set at a much lower level than the actual costs for the technical examination at that time to avoid a prohibitive high level of the fee. In 2019 the situation is very different. The CPVO received over 95 PCS applications in the last 48 months and this fee adjustment is the result of a cost calculation exercise between the CPVO and Naktuinbouw.

Today is an important day because - on top of our mutual interest for plant breeding - we all have something new in common.\u00a0Yes, we can say it officially now: we are all \u201cinvited\u201d! Not only were we all \u201cinvited\u201d to join this kick-off event in the city of Angers. We are also all \u201cinvited\u201d because each one of us is directly involved in the INVITE project! INVITE stands for Innovations in Plant Variety Testing in Europe, and \u2013 as you all know it - innovation is key for the sustainability of our sector and the future of Europe.INVITE is an ambitious research project funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 programme.\u00a0With a budget of 8 million euro for the next 5 years, it gathers a consortium of 27 partners among which the CPVO is a proud member. With its focus on 10 crops, INVITE aims to make variety testing more efficient.\u00a0INVITE will also contribute to make relevant information on variety performance available, taking account of trials under diversified production conditions as well as on biotic and abiotic stresses.\u00a0 Why is INVITE important? I see several reasons justifying the experimentation and rollout of innovative and sustainable approaches to plant variety testing through the INVITE project. I would like to highlight four of them. The first one is efficiency and gains.\u00a0 The size of reference collections for the assessment of DUS testing is always increasing. In consequence, examination offices need to find new strategies to control the size and cost of the trials.\u00a0 INVITE will explore how to make DUS and performance testing more efficient. It will increase the synergies between testing activities based on phenotyping, genotyping, modelling, new imaging techniques and database management.\u00a0 Those who attended the workshop earlier today could see by themselves how innovative imaging techniques, such as the use of low cost sensors and vector technologies, can make DUS testing more effective.\u00a0 By using new models and tools, the quality of data and the interpretation of results may be improved to avoid redundancy of analyses and to make more value of existing processes.\u00a0 The second one is harmonization and quality assurance.\u00a0 The need for variety testing to adapt to new characteristics makes public investment in research projects like INVITE absolutely essential. Think for instance of: (1) traits relevant to sustainability and resilience;\u00a0 (2) new requirements \u2013 for instance, resistance to pests and abiotic stresses;\u00a0 (3) and, new agricultural practices \u2013 for instance, heterogeneity thresholds for alternative materials. All these scenarios require the optimization and harmonization of procedures so that it can lead to quicker and more robust decisions on DUS and VCU.\u00a0 Both the regulator and plant breeders agree that Plant Variety testing is important to certify that the varieties entering the market are well-performing and meet all necessary quality standards. For farmers and plant producers, it is the guarantee to use varieties that are of a maximum quality. Varieties that are diverse, harvestable and resistant to pests and diseases. Efficient variety testing is really in the interest of everyone, and not the least of our fellow citizens. They expect a high level of trust in all goods placed on the market. And this is even more true when it comes to food products. The third one is our commitment to address global challenges and invest in our future generations. Agriculture and food-related sectors are currently facing key global challenges: climate change, the ever-growing human population, food safety and scarcity of natural resources.\u00a0 Let us look quickly at the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals, in particular the \u201czero hunger in the world\u201d objective.\u00a0 According to the latest UN figures, the proportion of undernourished people worldwide increased from 10.6% in 2015 to 11% in 2016. This translates to 815 million people worldwide in 2016, and I presume that the figure has grown since then.\u00a0 Sustainable agricultural production and efficient plant variety testing can help addressing some of these most burning issues, and I am happy that the European Commission has included plant variety testing in its Horizon 2020 programme.\u00a0 It is also worth pointing out that Finland, who is holding the Presidency of the EU Council since the 1st of July, shares the same assessment.\u00a0In their list of priorities for their EU Presidency, Finland has highlighted that: \u201cA reformed and modernised Common Agricultural Policy must respond to the challenges of food safety, food security, climate change and environmental protection\u201d.\u00a0 The fourth one is about enhancing collaboration between all stakeholders, public and private, from all corners of Europe.\u00a0 INVITE is an \u201cinvitation\u201d to work together. It must be seen as a joint venture between 27 partners from across Europe and from across different sectors ranging from research institutes, breeders associations and DUS examination offices.\u00a0 In addition, a Stakeholder Platform and a Stakeholder Advisory Board (SAB), with representatives from the industry, has been launched for advising the project partners on issues where the input from industry stakeholders is necessary and for promoting the project\u2019s outcomes.\u00a0 This broad partnership will ensure constructive feedback from all parties involved, closer collaboration and more transparency.\u00a0 What is the role of the CPVO in such a venture? However, a project with 27 partners also provides some challenges.\u00a0 The CPVO is part of the INVITE Executive Committee, which is the decision implementing body of the project. We will use this role to ensure that all partners work as a team in a seamless manner and towards the same the direction. We will also contribute to the eight technical Work Packages identified in the project. As the CPVO technical protocols apply to DUS tests, both for variety protection and for marketing authorization, we believe we will be able to provide valuable inputs to the project.\u00a0 And especially, the CPVO will bring its almost 25-year long experience and deep knowledge from managing the EU-wide DUS testing network into INVITE. To give you a precise idea: the CPVO processed more than 60,000 applications for Plant Variety Rights since 1995 and received 3,554 applications in 2018.\u00a0You can find data and figures about the CPVO\u2019s activities in our latest annual report, which is available on our website. Finally, the CPVO remains committed to report regularly on the progress of the INVITE project to its large network of stakeholders in the European Union and beyond. Having said that, it is nonetheless the first time that the CPVO is involved in such a large-scale R&D project, and I sincerely hope that \u2013 together - we will be able to foster more innovation and efficiency in plant variety testing.\u00a0 I really look forward to working with you all. Before closing my speech, I would like to express my gratitude again to the European Commission who decided to make plant variety testing more efficient through Horizon2020 and to invest in the INVITE project. I would not be standing here today if the bid we put together had not been successful. The success of the bid can be attributed to all of you.\u00a0 So I would also like to thank all partners involved in the project consortium \u2013 breeders, researchers, examination offices - with a special kudos to INRA, and in particular to Fran\u00e7ois Laurens, for his coordination and leadership role in the INVITE project and for organizing today\u2019s event.\u00a0 It is a pleasure for me representing the CPVO to address you at this occasion, but the day-to-day work at the Office is managed by C\u00e9cile Collonnier and Anne Weitz and I would like to thank them in particular. \u00a0 We now have a plan, and we have financial support. What remains is hard work to implement the project and to come up with good results. This kick-off meeting is an excellent opportunity to get to know each other better in the workshops as well as in social gatherings. So, good luck to us all and a lot of success in achieving our common goals in this ambitious project. \u00a0 Thank you for the attention. \u00a0 Speech delivered at the kick-off meeting of the INVITE H2020 Project on 8 July 2019 in Angers, France.

Link: Public search in CPVO applications and titles in force Background: Until today, variety descriptions of parental lines and hybrids were withheld from publication in order to limit the risk of divulging the parent formula of hybrid varieties in response to the wish of the breeders. In 2017, on request of the European Seed Association (ESA), the CPVO carried out a survey to entrusted examination offices with the aim to understand and verify if certain information given in variety descriptions of parental lines could be revealed without jeopardizing the parent formula of hybrid varieties. The outcome of the survey showed that there were no major issues in making such VDs publicly available and it was agreed with the Breeders\u2019 associations and the technical experts that the publication of variety descriptions would not harm the breeders\u2019 interests under the condition that confidential information, in accordance with Article 88.3, is withheld from inspection. The CPVO committed to review each variety description before publication in order to make sure that no information revealing the parent formula of a hybrid would be made publicly available. The CPVO has duly checked all existing agricultural species before today\u2019s VDs release. The checking of VDs of vegetable species will be finalised soon, their publication will follow in due course.

Mrs Madeleine Majorenko, Head of the European Economic and Trade Office in Taipei participated during the signing ceremony and congratulated the two signing parties. For many years the plant variety rights authorities of Taiwan, Naktuinbouw (EU entrusted examination office for the species concerned based in the Netherlands) and the CPVO have worked to harmonize the way of conducting technical examinations for these crops. As now similar standards were reached, the Arrangement could be signed. Breeders will still have to apply for plant variety rights to both authorities if they wish to have their new varieties protected in both Taiwan and the EU. However, the technical examination of the variety has to be conducted only once. The technical examination \u2013 being the basis for the grant of the title of protection \u2013 will be carried out on the basis of the CPVO Technical Protocol which is in turn based upon the corresponding UPOV Test Guideline. Martin Ekvad states that \u201cin the EU we received 112 applications for these species in 2018 and in the past ten years 827 applications were received. EU applicants file many applications in Taiwan every year. Accepting the findings of a technical examination already carried out by the other authority will accelerate the granting process for the subsequent application. In addition, breeders will no longer have to pay two examination fees but only an administrative fee of EUR 320 or the equivalent in TWD in the second application procedure. \u00a0There are two main aims for this project; to facilitate the processing of applications for breeders and to improve procedures when working together with authorities outside the EU. \u201c \u00a0 Breeders are nevertheless required to submit a reference sample of five plants to the testing station of the authority taking over the report.

CPVO together with 26 partners across Europe from various sectors ranging from research, breeding, DUS examination [2] to performance testing for both conventional and organic farming, participate in INVITE. INVITE is coordinated by the French research organization INRA. The amount awarded is about 8 million euros to be spent in a period of 5 years. The project aims at improving efficiency of variety testing and availability of information to stakeholders on variety performance under diversified production conditions and on biotic and abiotic stresses. It addresses DUS and performance testing in a balanced way and intends to maximize synergies between them through related activities based on phenotyping, genotyping, modelling and database management. INVITE will focus on 10 crops. The identification of the research needs and main challenges to be addressed for each of the crops was based on main end-users needs (Examination Offices, CPVO, breeders, farmers), taking into account existing knowledge and projects. One expected impact is the introduction of plant traits into the testing protocols that respond to new challenges and demands in the conventional and organic sectors, while also taking into account the economic return of growers. Martin Ekvad, President of the CPVO, states that \u201cAgriculture and food systems sectors are at the very heart of the key challenges to be addressed for the years to come, including adaptation to climate change, ensure food security and safeguarding natural resources. I am very happy that in its Horizon 2020 Work Program, aimed at addressing such challenges, the EU has included plant variety testing as an important element. I am convinced that the CPVO and its partners working at examining facilities across the EU as well as all the other partners to INVITE will contribute to a successful project from which the sector and in the end the citizens will benefit\u201d The next step is now the signature of the Consortium agreement and the launching of the work through the organization of the kick-off meeting at the start of 2019. \u00a0 Update: the official website of the INVITE project was launched on 15 November 2019.

Martin Ekvad detailed the national PVP systems in the EU, the EU PVP system, the interface of PVP rights between the national and EU systems, as well as CPVO relationships with third countries. He explained that national PVP protection is available in 24 EU countries, while EU protection covers all 28 EU Member States. The national and EU systems operate in parallel; however, cumulative protection under both is prohibited. Of particular relevance to parties outside the EU, Martin Ekvad advised that, on request, the CPVO and national plant variety offices provide reports on Distinctness, Uniformity and Stability (DUS) to third countries in which an application has been made for the same variety and that, under certain circumstances, both the CPVO and national plant variety offices may accept DUS reports from authorities in other countries as a basis for granting a PVP. The conference follows the IP Key SEA Study Visit on Plant Varieties held in Viet Nam earlier in the week, in which Martin Ekvad provided an overview of the EU plant variety rights system, and the role of the CPVO in ensuring protection for new varieties developed by plant breeders more broadly.

The main objective of the seminar was to promote investments in plant breeding and benefits in protecting new plant varieties at national or EU level. More than 130 participants from the private and the public sectors attended the event. Presentations were given by experts from Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Serbia on the organisation of the plant variety protection system and enforcement rules applicable in those countries as well as experts from UPOV, breeders\u2019 organisations, farmers\u2019 associations and public research institutes. The first session aimed at presenting the EU PVR system, and the experiences of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Serbia with special focus in the wheat breeding challenges in the Balkan region and the royalty collection system in the Czech Republic. An overview of the role played by the plant variety protection in supporting public-private partnerships concluded the session. The second session focused on the benefits of plant variety protection from the perspective of breeders, public-private partnership and farmers. The last session focused on challenges in enforcing plant varieties. The seminar showed that an effective system of plant variety protection is a driver for investments in agriculture through the development of new varieties of plants for the benefit of farmers and the society at large.

This means that, unless a ratified withdrawal agreement1 establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET) ('the withdrawal date').2 The United Kingdom will then become a 'third country'3. Preparing for the withdrawal is not just a matter for EU and national authorities but also for private parties. In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, all breeders within the meaning of Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2100/94 on Community plant variety rights (hereinafter: the Basic Regulation) are reminded of legal repercussions, which need to be considered when the United Kingdom becomes a third country. Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of Plant Variety Rights no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This has, in particular, the following consequences: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All Community Plant Variety Rights granted pursuant to the Basic Regulation will remain valid in the Union territory, regardless of the origin of the breeder or the location of the Examination Offices.\uf0b7 The Examination Offices in the United Kingdom will no longer have the possibility to participate in the technical verification of the maintenance of the protected varieties pursuant to Articles 64 and 65 of the Basic Regulation. Technical verifications following 30 March 2019 will be organised by the CPVO in an EU-27 based Examination Office.\uf0b7 According to Article 82 of the Basic Regulation, persons who are not domiciled or do not have a seat or an establishment within the EU territory may participate as party to proceedings before the Office only if they have designated a procedural representative who is domiciled or has his seat or an establishment within the EU territory. All interested breeders who are currently domiciled or have a seat in the United Kingdom only should consider the need to designate in a timely manner a procedural representative to comply with the provisions of that Article. Actions to be taken by the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO) The Examination Offices in the United Kingdom are entrusted for 864 botanical taxa. Out of those, there are 678 botanical taxa for which no other Examination Office is entrusted in the Union. The CPVO has received applications regarding 324 of the aforesaid 678 botanical taxa. In order to ensure the continuity of the technical examination of varieties belonging to those botanical taxa, the CPVO has organised a procedure (the \"new species procedure\") to ensure as from 30 March 2019 at the latest the entrustment of Examination Offices in the Union to cover at least all 324 botanical taxa for which an actual application for a Community Plant Variety Right has been received by the CPVO. The procedure has progressed satisfactorily and six Examination Offices have been entrusted in the Union for 322 of the above species. However, taking into account the need for some Examination Offices to adapt to the new technical expectations, DUS tests for some species can only start in October 2018 or January 2019. All information on entrusted Examination Offices and species are available on the CPVO web site. In order to avoid as much as possible transitional difficulties, CPVO will stop assigning the technical examination of varieties (Article 55(1) of the Basic Regulation) to the Examination Offices in the United Kingdom, where that examination is expected to last beyond 29 March 2019. The website of the Commission, Directorate General 'Health and Food Safety', on Plants provides general information concerning Plant Variety Property Rights4.

Dirk Theobald, the present Head of the Technical Unit, will therefore\u00a0take on a portfolio with technical matters to support the Presidency as Senior Adviser. Some of his new tasks will also be linked to promoting the EU PVP system. In order to replace Dirk Theobald as Head of the Technical Unit, a selection procedure was launched, to which Gerhard Schuon was the successful candidate. Gerhard Schuon has been working as the CPVO Quality Audit Service (QAS) team leader for nine years. He will be replaced by Sergio Semon, technical expert specialized in vegetables. The changes will take effect as from 1 February 2018. Martin Ekvad, CPVO President, says that: \u201cDirk Theobald has a vast experience in PVP related matters and is a leading expert in the EU and the UPOV world. He will be a great asset to the CPVO Presidency. Gerhard Schuon has set up the EU Quality Audit System in an independent and professional manner and after nine years on the post he knows all there is to know about the technical facilities in the examination offices that we work with, which will be valuable when moving forward. Sergio Semon was one of the first persons employed by the CPVO and knows all the ins and outs of the system. Sergio has also participated successfully in management training to qualify as a manager in the EU staff structure, and has acquired skills that will be very useful for his upcoming duties.

The conference attracted some 200 participants from industry and academia, the European Commission, European Parliament, legal practice, national patent offices, NGOs and the general public. In their opening statements, high-level representatives of the EPO and the CPVO took stock of the first two years of co-operation. According to Margot Fr\u00f6hlinger, EPO Principal Director for the Unitary Patent, European and International Legal Affairs, \u201cthe co-operation promotes information and transparency in the area of plant innovation. The CPVO and the EPO are jointly committed to ensuring that both breeders and industry maintain their confidence in the validity and quality of patents and plant breeders\u2019 rights,\u201d she said. Martin Ekvad, CPVO President, said: \u201cBasing our co-operation on an Administrative Arrangement will also in future contribute to a better understanding between our institutions on a technical and legal level. This helps us in turn to better inform industry and the public on the implementation of two mutually supportive IP systems.\u201d After both offices explained their roles and practice, three expert panels moderated by Anselm Kamperman Sanders, Professor of IP Law at Maastricht University, explored some of the key themes surrounding plant innovation. Speakers outlined how the EPO responded to the Commission Notice C/2016/6997 in relation to essentially biological breeding methods by proposing amendments of Rules 27(b) and 28 of the European Patent Convention to our Administrative Council earlier this year, and how these rules are now applied in the Office\u2019s patenting practice. Enhancing the transparency of IP rights was a further key topic of the conference, with speakers explaining how third parties, including the general public, can follow all stages of both the patent and PVR granting processes. Patent applications and granted patents are mandatorily published, which signifies that the teachings set out in these documents are freely accessible to the public, for instance in the EPO\u2019s patent database Espacenet. PVR documents are publicly available from the CPVO, either directly from the office\u2019s website or on request. Industry initiatives such as the Patent Information and Transparency Online (PINTO) database, which provides a link between a plant variety and a patent or patent application, aim to enhance transparency further. All of the day\u2019s presentations were met with strong interest from the floor as the largely expert audience responded with well-informed questions and thus contributed to a very lively round of discussions. EPO and CPVO: committed to quality Aware of the public debate about plant protection and their social responsibilities, both the EPO and CPVO attach utmost importance to delivering quality work in their practice. At the EPO, for instance, less than one in three patent applications in biotechnology becomes a European patent, while the overall grant rate in all fields of technology is around 48%. Patent examiners working in biotechnology are trained intensively to accurately apply the patent law in their field. This also includes regular exchanges with CPVO experts and the use of state-of-the-art databases, in particular plant genome databases. At the CPVO high quality is ensured by setting quality requirements to be followed by entrusted examination offices, which are audited regularly. Co-operation between the two offices has already significantly enhanced the sharing of information among their experts. Moreover, both the EPO and the CPVO jointly aim to raise awareness of the benefits of protecting innovation in the plant and breeding sector, in order to create growth and employment in these areas, and thus serve the economy and society as a whole. \u00a0Further information: Conference \u201cEPO and CPVO: supporting innovation in the plant sector\u201d EPO and CPVO agree on bilateral co-operation EPO and CPVO exchange practices on patenting of plant-related inventions and plant variety protection Biotechnology patents at the EPO", "url": "https://cpvo.europa.eu/en/news-and-events/news/supporting-innovation-plant-sector-ip-rights-epo-cpvo-conference-brussels"}, {"id": "CVPO_NEWS_0132", "date": "2017-11-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Administrative Arrangement on technical cooperation signed with SFA PVPO, China", "text": "Administrative Arrangement on technical cooperation SFA PVPO, CHINA \u2013 CPVO The PVP Office, State Forestry Administration (SFA), and the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO) have decided on 15 November 2017 to initiate technical cooperation in the area of plant variety rights.

In particular, it is responsible for examining the President\u2019s management report, adopting the Office\u2019s budget and granting discharge to the President in respect of its implementation. In addition, it can provide advice, establish rules on working methods within the Office and issue guidelines on technical examinations, committees of the Office and general matters. M. Geert Dancet appointed Chairman of the Audit Advisory Board The CPVO Administrative Council appointed Mr Geert Dancet as the new Chair of the AAB. Mr Dancet who is currently the Executive Director of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in Helsinki has been pivotal in setting up ECHA as one of the largest regulatory agencies in the EU and has profound experience in public administration committed to independence, transparency and efficiency. Under his leadership, the AAB will provide independent advice to the members of the AC in respect of any complaint raised in the context of the audit programme for the entrusted examination offices. His willingness to accept this role is much appreciated by the members of the AC and by the CPVO. Adoption of CPVO strategic plan 2017-2021 On 4 October, the members of the AC adopted the Strategic Plan 2017-2021 of the CPVO which provides an overall vision for the future up to 2021 and elaborates on that vision, detailing the activities planned each year on a rolling 3 year basis. The vision of the CPVO is to be a dynamic, people-driven IP organisation, highly recognised within industry and stakeholders. As part of a strong network of IP players, it contributes to a coherent and harmonized legal framework for the benefit of its stakeholders and will be a \u2018natural choice\u2019 for protection of plant varieties. The strategic vision is based on the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the CPVO laid down in its mission statement: \"To deliver and promote an efficient Intellectual Property Rights system that supports the creation of new plant varieties for the benefit of Society\". \u00a0This will be achieved by focusing on two main strategic goals: - Making PVR the natural choice for the protection of IP related to plant varieties; - An innovative, people-driven organisation, promoting EU values. The over-arching objectives of the strategic plan are: 1. Achieving excellence through people \u2013 giving life to our values 2. Supporting breeders with a robust and reliable Intellectual Property Right 3. Make the CPVO strong in a strong Intellectual Property network 4. Promoting PVR, in the EU and internationally The complete CPVO strategic plan 2017-2021 is available here on the CPVO website. \u00a0Adoption of the CPVO programming document In accordance with the requirements of the financial regulations, and after having consulted with the European Commission, the members of the AC adopted the CPVO Programming document which outlines the work program for 2018-2020 and the necessary resources in order for the CPVO to carry out its tasks. This programming document provides the details of how the CPVO plans over the coming years to deliver and promote an efficient intellectual property rights system that supports the creation of new plant varieties for the benefit of Society. The complete CPVO programming document 2018-2020 is available here on the CPVO website. \u00a0Adoption of the new CPVO International strategy The new CPVO International strategy adopted by the AC at its October meeting underlines the CPVO\u2019s contribution to the harmonisation of the Plant variety rights system at the international level, lays down the guiding principles and modalities for international co-operation and sets priorities for CPVO\u2019s relations with third countries and international organisations. Improving IP protection systems overseas can offer European companies new business opportunities. The CPVO, together with the Commission services, the Member States and other international organisations, is working outside the EU in an effort to strengthen the CPVR IP protection system. The key elements of this cooperation are exchange of knowledge, and support for EU users on registration and enforcement overseas, in cooperation with the EU Member States.

This uncertainty will significantly affect the conditions under which goods that are placed on the market in the Union before the withdrawal date could continue to circulate between the EU27 and the UK. The Withdrawal Agreement should ensure that: (a) the protection enjoyed in the United Kingdom on the basis of Union law by both UK and EU 27 holders of intellectual property rights having unitary character within the Union before the withdrawal date is not undermined by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union; (b) procedure-related rights (e.g. right of priority) in relation to an application for an intellectual property right having unitary character within the Union still pending on the withdrawal date are not lost when applying for an equivalent intellectual property right in the United Kingdom; (c) applications for supplementary protection certificates or for the extension of their duration in the United Kingdom on-going before the withdrawal date are completed in accordance with the conditions set out in Union law; (d) databases protected in the EU27 and the UK before the withdrawal date continue to enjoy protection after that date and (e) exhaustion before the withdrawal date within the Union of the rights conferred by intellectual property rights is not affected by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. I. General Principles The following General Principles should apply in accordance with Union law, as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union on the date of entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement: (1) Intellectual property rights having unitary character within the Union. The holder of any intellectual property right having unitary character within the Union and granted before the withdrawal date should, after that date, be recognised as the holder of an enforceable intellectual property right in relation to the United Kingdom territory, comparable to the right provided by Union law \u2013 if need be on the basis of specific domestic legislation to be introduced. In the specific case of protected geographical indications, protected designations of origin and other protected terms in relation to agricultural products (traditional specialities guaranteed and traditional terms for wine) protected under Union law before the withdrawal date, this principle should also imply that the United Kingdom puts in place, as of the withdrawal date, the necessary domestic legislation providing for their continued protection. Such protection should be comparable to that provided by Union law1. 1 N.B. there is currently no domestic legislation in the United Kingdom on the protection of designations of origin and geographical indications as well as on other protected terms in relation to agricultural products. The implementation of this principle should include, in particular,the automatic recognition of an intellectual property right in the United Kingdom on the basis of the existing intellectual property right having unitary character within the Union. \u00a0Where applicable to the relevant right, the implementation of this principle should also include: o the determination of the renewal dates; o the respect of priority and seniority principles; o the adaptation of 'genuine use' requirements2 and 'reputation' rules3 to the specific situation under consideration. 2 E.g. the recognition of a trade mark in the United Kingdom should not be refused on the ground that the equivalent EU trade mark had not been put into genuine use in the territory of the United Kingdom before the withdrawal date. 3 E.g. the owner of an EU trade mark having reputation in the European Union should be allowed, after the withdrawal date, to temporarily exercise in the United Kingdom rights equivalent to those foreseen in Article 9(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 and Article 5(3)(a) of Directive 2015/2436 in respect of the equivalent national trade mark even if the equivalent national trade mark in question does not yet have a specific reputation within the United Kingdom. The implementation of this principle should not result in financial costs for the holders of intellectual property rights having unitary character within the Union. Any related administrative burden for such holders should be kept to a strict minimum. (2) Applications for Intellectual property rights having unitary character within the Union. Where an application for an intellectual property right having unitary character within the Union has been submitted before an Union body in accordance with Union law before the withdrawal date and the administrative procedure for the grant of the right concerned is still on-going on that date, the applicant should be entitled to keep the benefit of any priority date in respect of such pending application when applying after the withdrawal date for an equivalent intellectual property right in the United Kingdom. (3) Applications for supplementary protection certificates or for an extension of their duration. After the withdrawal date, a person should continue to be entitled to obtain in the United Kingdom a supplementary protection certificate or an extension of the duration of a supplementary protection certificate (so-called paediatric extensions) where such person had submitted before the withdrawal date an application for a supplementary protection certificate or an extension of its duration before a United Kingdom authority in accordance with Union law and the administrative procedure for the grant of the certificate concerned or its extension is still on-going on the withdrawal date. Any certificate so granted or extended should provide for protection equivalent to that provided for by Union law. (4) Legal protection of databases. Makers or rightholders of databases protected pursuant to Article 7 of Directive 96/9/EC in the EU Member States before the withdrawal date should continue to enjoy protection after that date in the EU27 Member States and in the UK in relation to those databases. For this purpose, the requirements of Article 11(1) and (2) should be waived in the EU27 Member States in respect of UK nationals and UK companies and firms; conversely, the UK should not exclude EU27 nationals and EU27 companies and firms from legal protection of databases in the UK on nationality or establishment grounds. (5) Exhaustion of rights. Rights conferred by intellectual property rights which were exhausted in the European Union territory before the withdrawal date should, after that date, remain exhausted in both the EU27 territory and in the UK territory. The conditions for exhaustion concerning each intellectual property right should be those defined by Union law. For instance, in relation to trade marks, the rights conferred by the trade mark to prohibit its use in relation to a good are exhausted when such good (to which the trade mark is related) was put on the market in the Union before the withdrawal date by the proprietor of the trade mark or with the proprietor's consent. II. Definitions For the purpose of this paper, the notion of 'Intellectual property right having unitary character within the Union' refers to any of the following rights: - a 'European Union trade mark' registered in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 of 26 February 2009 on the European Union trade mark4; - a 'registered Community design' registered in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 of 12 December 2001 on Community designs; - an 'unregistered Community design' made available to the public in the manner provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 of 12 December 2001 on Community designs. - a 'Community plant variety right' granted pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 2100/94 of 27 July 1994 on Community plant variety rights. - a 'protected geographical indication' or a 'protected designation of origin' registered in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs; - a 'protected geographical indication' or a 'protected designation of origin' registered in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products; - a 'geographical indication' registered in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January 2008 on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks; - a 'geographical indication' registered in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 251/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of aromatised wine products. 4 N.B. this Regulation will be repealed on 1 October 2017 by Regulation (EU) 2017/1001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the European Union trade mark. For the purpose of this paper, 'traditional speciality guaranteed' registered in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 and 'traditional terms for wine' registered in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, collectively referred to as 'other protected terms in relation to agricultural products' should be assimilated to intellectual property rights having unitary character within the Union and also be covered by the material scope of the paper. 'Supplementary protection certificate' means a certificate in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 concerning the supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products or with Regulation (EC) No 1610/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for plant protection products. It also includes certificates that benefit from an extension of their duration pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on medicinal products for paediatric use. III. Data transfer and cooperation For the purpose of facilitating the implementation of General Principle (1), the Withdrawal agreement should provide for adequate cooperation and the transfer of relevant data between the entities charged with the registries of intellectual property rights in the UK and in the EU27. Any such transfer of data should comply with the general principles set out in the paper on 'Essential Principles on the Protection of Data and Information Obtained or Processed before the Withdrawal Date'. * * *", "url": "https://cpvo.europa.eu/en/news-and-events/news/position-paper-transmitted-eu27-intellectual-property-rights"}, {"id": "CVPO_NEWS_0140", "date": "2017-08-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Official Publications 4.2017", "text": "The Official Publication of the CPVO 4.2017 and the S2 Publication have been published and are available for free in electronic format only (PDF).

This means that unless the withdrawal agreement establishes another date or the period is extended by the European Council in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, all Union primary and secondary law ceases to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, 00:00h (CET). The United Kingdom would then become a 'third country'. In view of the considerable uncertainties, in particular concerning the content of a possible withdrawal agreement, all breeders within the meaning of Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2100/94 on Community plant variety rights[2] (hereinafter: the Basic Regulation) are reminded of certain legal repercussions stemming from currently applicable rules of Union law if the United Kingdom becomes a third country, which need to be considered. Issues to be considered by the breeders All Community Plant Variety Rights granted pursuant to the Basic Regulation will remain valid in the Union territory, regardless of the origin of the breeder or the location of the Examination Offices. The Examination Offices in the United Kingdom will no longer have the possibility to participate in the technical verification of the maintenance of the protected varieties pursuant to Articles 64 and 65 of the Basic Regulation. Technical verifications following 30 March 2019 will be organised by the CPVO in an EU-27 based Examination Office. According to Article 82 of the Basic Regulation, persons who are not domiciled or do not have a seat or an establishment within the EU territory may participate as party to proceedings before the Office only if they have designated a procedural representative who is domiciled or has his seat or an establishment within the EU territory. All interested breeders who are currently domiciled or have a seat in the United Kingdom only, should consider the need of timely designating a procedural representative to comply with the provisions of that Article. Actions to be taken by the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO) The Examination Offices in the United Kingdom are entrusted for 864 botanical taxa. Out of those there are 678 botanical taxa for which no other Examination Office is entrusted in the Union. It is to be noted that the CPVO has received applications regarding 324 of the aforesaid 678 botanical taxa. In order to ensure the continuity of the technical examination of varieties belonging to those botanical taxa, the CPVO has organised a procedure (the \"new species procedure\" with deadline 30 July 2017) to ensure as from 30 March 2019 at the latest the entrustment of Examination Offices in the Union to cover at least all 324 botanical taxa for which an actual application for a Community Plant Variety Right has been received by the CPVO. A subsequent procedure to include additional botanical taxa may follow later. After the new species procedure is completed, breeders will be informed about the new Examination Offices for the respective species. In order to avoid as much as possible transitional difficulties, CPVO will stop assigning the technical examination of varieties (Article 55(1) of the Basic Regulation) to the Examination Offices in the United Kingdom, where that examination is expected to last beyond 29 March 2019. Nevertheless, we also need to remind stakeholders that preparing for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom is not just a matter for European and national administrations, but also for private parties. Breeders may thus be required to monitor the developments, adapt processes and to consider the changes described above. \u00a0 [1] Treaty on European Union, OJ C 326, 26.10.2012, p. 13\u2013390 [2] Council Regulation (EC) No 2100/94 of 27 July 1994 on Community plant variety rights, OJ L 227, 1.9.1994, p. 1", "url": "https://cpvo.europa.eu/en/news-and-events/news/notice-breeders-subject-union-legislation-plant-variety-rights-council-regulation-ec-no-210094"}, {"id": "CVPO_NEWS_0135", "date": "2017-06-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Official Publications 3.2017", "text": "The Official Publication of the CPVO 3.2017 and the S2 Publication have been published and are available for free in electronic format only (PDF).

The CPVO presented their views and recommendations for the committee. The CPVO, as one of the few fully self-financed European Agencies has a tailor-made governance structure taking account of its role,\u00a0 in which the Administrative Council, in the presence of breeders organisations, approves the budget and human resource allocations and provides the so-called \u2018discharge\u2019 of the President. The meeting of the European Parliament, organised by the policy department on budgetary affairs for the committee on budgets and the committee on budgetary control sought the views of the European Commission, the European Food Safety Agency (representing all agencies), the European Aviation Safety Agency (a partially self-financed agency) and the CPVO, as one of the main fully-self financed agencies. The European Commission explained that they are open to linking staff resource requests to workload indicators, and a pilot project is currently underway with a view to having a harmonised methodology for doing this. EFSA provided a general overview of the Agencies, which now number 45, and also the role of the coordination of agencies, and finally, EASA provided their feedback on the pilot study for resource levels. The CPVO (President Martin Ekvad) outlined a number of important issues for the committee to take into consideration. It is important for a fee-financed agency such as the CPVO to be independent, and close to its customers (the breeders). Such independence has allowed the CPVO to develop a strong reputation in industry and also to attract and retain high quality staff. It was reminded, that with very limited staff, and as one of the smallest agencies in the EU, the CPVO manages the largest system of its kind in the world. The key focus of the CPVO, beyond meeting regulatory requirements incumbent on all agencies, is to provide an effective, efficient and economical system of plant breeder\u2019s rights. In terms of governance, the budget of the CPVO is approved in the presence of the breeders organisations (the representatives of the clients who fund the system), and also with the presence of the European Commission. This, coupled with audit by the European Court of Auditors and regular internal audit provide a very strong governance structure, and one indeed (as the Parliament committee was reminded) that could serve as a model for fully-financed agencies. The CPVO, reserve fund is managed, not through discretionary spending, but rather through fee adjustment, and in this manner, fee changes in the past have allowed the reduction of the reserve from 12 million EUR in 2012 to just over EUR 500.000 in 2016, thereby returning the reserve to the breeders. On the issue of human resources requests, the CPVO reminded that it has been increasing efficiencies which has allowed it to meet the Commission target of a 5% reduction in staffing, but in order to keep a critical mass of staff, and react to increasing application numbers, it is important that a flexible approach be taken. Further cuts across the board to all agencies would be detrimental to the functioning of the CPVO and the linking of human resources to workload indicators such as the number of applications processed or the number of active titles in force is self-evident. The CPVO are not in favour of being part of the European Parliament discharge procedure as the current discharge in the presence of the breeders provides a more efficient system with direct contact with the \u2018taxpayer\u2019. In summary, the key messages of the CPVO to the European Parliament were: Fee-receiving agencies provide significant added-value in their respective domains More flexibility needs to be given to manage its resources taking into consideration real workload The fee-receiving agencies governance models work, and should be maintained The CPVO is open to making annual presentations to the Parliamentary Committees with a view to increasing transparency.", "url": "https://cpvo.europa.eu/en/news-and-events/news/ep-workshop-oversight-and-resources-fee-receiving-eu-agencies"}, {"id": "CVPO_NEWS_0148", "date": "2017-04-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Announcement n\u25e6 3/2017 of the Community Plant Variety Office.

Preparing and positioning the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO) for the years to come requires the ambition to be a key player in the evolving Intellectual Property and plant variety landscape, the openness to developing as an organisation on the basis of a partnership approach and the necessary financial and human resources to best serve our stakeholders. The on-line survey provided a comprehensive feedback as most of the 35 respondents addressed all areas of the draft strategy document. The overall reactions have been very positive and particularly supportive for the mission statement, the Office\u2019s values and the strategic objectives. Several adjustments were made to the draft in response to the survey in order to enhance its clarity. CPVO\u2019s stakeholders were defined in more detail. Most of the aspects suggested for addition to the document have already been taken into consideration in existing policies or are subject of subsequent and more detailed planning documents. Transparency, good administrative behavior, sound financial management, striving for efficiency and level playing field for competitors etc. are recognised as guiding principles of a horizontal nature. Comments emphasising the importance of a strong protection to strengthen enforcement of PVRs, the relevance of networking with other EU Institutions and national Authorities and reinforcing cooperation confirmed the strategic direction. This also highlights that the quality of services provided by the Office is a priority for users. The predominantly constructive feedback was much appreciated.

The major success of the implementation of its online application system in 2015 demonstrated the motivation of its clients to go electronic. Building on this experience, the CPVO has developed an all-new e-communication tool, called \u201cMyPVR\u201d, which is launched today on the CPVO website. What is MyPVR? MyPVR is the new client portal for all contact with the CPVO, aiming to computerise all steps in the application process, and further enhance electronic interaction between applicants and the CPVO.\u00a0 It encompasses all the e-services that have been provided to applicants thus far, including the online application system and the Variety Finder, establishing a centralised and secure area for file-related communication. How was MyPVR developed? The original idea behind the MyPVR project was to move away from the paper exchange that added an administrative burden to an already time-consuming process. By shifting to paperless, the CPVO wished to increase efficiency in the application procedure, and create a clear and direct channel for external communication. \u00a0 This tool paves the way for a major change in the way the CPVO will interact with clients in the future, and the CPVO was eager for participation from technical staff during the project development stage.\u00a0 At the helm of the project, a cross-departmental working group ensured the tool was well-suited for optimising communication at each step of the application process. In addition, a test phase with clients allowed the CPVO to implement feedback and recommendations from future users, and be certain that the design met their needs in terms of its usability and content. What are the features of MyPVR? MyPVR is a secure area of the CPVO website, allowing clients to be connected to a central hub which stores all documentation and communications sent from and to the CPVO. Users will have access to file-related information and be able to communicate with the CPVO in relation to ongoing procedures. The area requires user identification, and will be accessible with the login and password used so far for the online application system or the Variety Finder. \u00a0 The area\u2019s main page provides users with an overview of the latest information for their ongoing application procedures, including notifications, recent documents, and pending fees. Various search options enable the user to quickly retrieve specific information, whether it be a document for an individual application, documents pertaining to a specific species, or an invoice. In line with the CPVO\u2019s commitment to enhanced transparency, public access for official documents will now be available directly through MyPVR. What are the advantages for stakeholders? This tool will allow clients to send documents to the CPVO more quickly, and directly to the relevant service. All new correspondence sent from the CPVO will appear in this space the day after it is processed, with an email notification sent to the client advising them that there is a document for their attention. On completion of the application procedure, a single and ordered application form will be produced, thereby easing review by the client, the CPVO, and the relevant Examination Office.\u00a0 Meanwhile, MyPVR empowers users to oversee their files in the way that best suits their needs. Clients can be safe in the knowledge that their documents are stored in a secure space, and accessible at any time. They can also manage their own access to the CPVO\u2019s system, whether consulting previous communication, checking the status of an application, or reviewing sent documents. Indeed, more information will be at their fingertips than ever before, including details on the technical examinations, and forecasts of dates within the application process. What\u2019s more, alerts can be requested for latest updates relating to a specific application or even a general species, so clients can be the first to know of any new information that is released. Can clients still choose to communicate by paper? Yes, clients can be identified in the system as either e-clients or paper clients. Clients who have always filed applications exclusively by paper will be indicated in the system as paper clients, and will continue to receive and send paper communication. All other clients, including new applicants, will be automatically initialised as e-clients. To opt out, e-clients will need to contact the Office to effect the change from e-client to paper client. By default, even for paper filers, the e-documents will be available in MyPVR. If these clients wish to switch to e-communication, an e-process will already be in place for their applications. What\u2019s next on the horizon? The CPVO will continue to be active in developing its e-services, with future MyPVR phases already in motion. For example, we will soon offer the possibility to propose a denomination on the secured web page instead of sending a scanned form. It is also the CPVO\u2019s aim to integrate a communication centre in order to replace emails with a centralised communication system. These developments would allow for a more structured exchange of information, and further improve the efficiency of both our internal work and our services to clients.

On 1 March 2017, the project EIPIN Innovation Society will be officially launched. We are recruiting 15 PhD candidates wishing to conduct doctoral research on the role of intellectual property in the adaptive complexities of innovation. The selected and successful candidates will be conferred a joint or double doctoral degree from two of the five participating universities. The application procedure is open until 29 March 2017, 23.59 CET. The research and training programme will start on 1 September 2017 (date of recruitment) and finish on 31 August 2020. EIPIN Innovation Society is a comprehensive project at the forefront of multidisciplinary research, examining the role of intellectual property (IP) as a complex adaptive system in innovation. The ambition is to enhance Europe\u2019s capacity to foster innovation-based sustainable economic growth globally. The primary research objective of the programme is to provide political leaders and stakeholders reliable conclusions and recommendations in the form of doctoral IP research on how to deal with the adaptive complexities of innovation cycles that secure economic benefits and uphold justice in the innovation society. Fifteen Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) are trained to present their research findings on a number of topics of great societal interest, and to guide inventors and entrepreneurs through the lifecycle of IP-intensive assets that takes human creativity into the marketplace. The research and training programme provides for an unprecedented environment for ESRs that aims at educating a new generation of professionals and academic researchers who are properly equipped to face these challenges of fostering innovation-based growth. It consists of a research and a training part, which are closely connected and mutually inform each other. The involvement of industry associations representing numerous undertakings provides great access to non-academic actors. The ESR positions are open to candidates from all domains of sciences, providing a solid foundation for cross-cutting research in the area of innovation policies, while overcoming a traditional separation of disciplines. The EIPIN Innovation programme, coordinated by Maastricht University, is a Marie Sk\u0197odowska Curie Innovative Training Network project, funded by the European Union.

Among the different grounds to refuse an application for CTM (the so called absolute grounds for refusal) the Board of Appeal concluded that if a trademark is applied to cover varieties that do not belong to closely related species, the trademark can be registered. In doing so, the Board of Appeal aligns the interpretation of closely related species to UPOV classes.

The annual fee will be restored to 300\u20ac, the level applicable in 2004 and in 2005, and the examination fees will cover in average about 85% of the effective examination costs (see list annexed). A list of all species with related cost groups and fees will soon be available on the CPVO web site. \tSince the beginning of the operations of the CPVO income has been in excess of expenditures until the CPVO Administrative Council decided that the accumulated reserve should be reduced to 5M\u20ac, the level necessary to safeguard the continuity of the operations of the CPVO. To achieve that aim the annual fees were first reduced from 400\u20ac to 300\u20ac in 2003 and further reduced to 200\u20ac in 2006 together with examination fees substantially below the cost level. \tIn 2008, the CPVO will reach the target level of 5M\u20ac for its free reserve (difference between cash and outstanding commitments). To keep the financial reserve of the CPVO to this appropriate level in the coming years, the revenue of the CPVO should be raised to balance expenditure : the annual fee will therefore be restored to its previous level and the fees relating to the technical examination will cover in average about 85% of the effective examination costs instead of 78% current cost recovery. The application fee amounts to 900\u20ac and remains at the same level set in the year 2000. \tThe amendment has also introduced the possibility for breeders to pay the fees by payment cards. \t\u00a0 Last April 2008 the European Commission amended Regulation (EC) No 1239/2008 as regards the use of electronic means in communication in proceedings before the Community Plant Variety Office. \tThis amendment will allow the CPVO to introduce a number of e-services including the possibility for breeders to file applications in electronic format online and to make payments online as well. Such services will be added to the present services but will not exclude persons from filing applications and others documents to the Office in paper format should they so wish. \tThe launch of e-services is a consequence of the customer satisfaction survey made in 2004 in which a majority of clients reacted positively to online services proposed to simplify CPVO procedures. \tThis amendment will be applicable as from 1 January 2009 and some new e-services will be available on the CPVO web site in 2009.

Object of the ruling of the CFI was an appeal against the decision of the CPVO, as confirmed by its Board of Appeal, that the variety SUMCOL 01 could not be clearly distinguished from a reference variety. For that reason SUMCOL 01 did not qualify for a Community Plant Variety Right. \u00a0 The main grounds of the appeal against the decision of the CPVO were: \u00a0 The reference variety from which SUMCOL 01 was considered not to be distinct was SUMCOL 01 itself. The non-distinctness was for that reason not a ground to refuse SUMCOL 01 plant variety protection. If the reference variety was another variety than SUMCOL 01 , it was not a variety of common knowledge. Also for that reason the non-distinctness could not be a reason to refuse SUMCOL 01 protection. The CFI dismissed the appeal. In its view there were no sufficient grounds to question the CPVO's assessment, based on the results of the technical examination performed by the Bundessortenamt, that SUMCOL 01 and the reference variety constituted two different varieties. The CPVO's assessment furthermore justified the decision of its Board of Appeal that the reference variety was a matter of common knowledge. The decision of the CFI is of fundamental importance, whereby it expresses the opinion that the appraisal of the distinctive character of a plant variety, a major requirement for plant variety protection, is of a scientific and technical complexity such as to justify a limit to the scope of judicial review.

Any arrangements which are made directly with an examination office but without consent of the CPVO will therefore jeopardise later examination results.", "url": "https://cpvo.europa.eu/en/news-and-events/news/apple-announcement-og-ndeg012004"}, {"id": "CVPO_NEWS_0332", "date": "2001-01-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "\"Payment of fees and surcharges\" (OG n\u00b003/2001)", "text": "Announcement No 02/2001 of the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO) in respect of the payment of fees and surcharges The CPVO does not accept cheque or cash payments.
