EULISA_PR_0002	2022-02-15	PR	Commissioner Reynders visits eu-LISA	" Page ContentThe EU Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, visited eu-LISA's Operational Site in Strasbourg on 14 February 2022.The main focus of the visit was the digitalisation of cross-border judicial cooperation in the EU. The Commissioner and the management of eu-LISA discussed a strategic approach and different aspects of the deployment of new digital solutions in modernising the judicial systems in the European Justice domain.Commissioner Reynders emphasised that the digitalisation of Justice will be a long but much needed process. It will comprise not only the necessity to speed-up digitalisation at national levels but also the need to invest in development of new tools and projects at the EU level. eu-LISA will play a crucial role, not only through the implementation of ongoing projects, but also in other current initiatives such as the Join Investigation Teams Collaboration Platform and future ones that should be part of an ambitious roadmap for the digitalisation of Justice. ""Europe is aiming for easy access to cross-border justice for citizens, businesses and legal practitioners. eu-LISA has a central role to play in this process and is already actively engaged with ongoing efforts towards the further digitalisation of the European Justice area. We are responsible for the technical maintenance of the ECRIS RI, are currently developing ECRIS-TCN and will also be taking over the maintenance of e-CODEX from mid-2023. These applications and systems are important building blocks that provide for a solid foundation in the context of the digitalisation of criminal justice"", said eu-LISA Executive Director Krum Garkov.The Executive Director reconfirmed the Agency's readiness to continue close cooperation with the Commission to ensure a timely implementation of ongoing initiatives. Mr Garkov emphasised the need to have a comprehensive multi-annual roadmap for the digitalisation of Justice that connects all its building blocks and allows all stakeholders, including the European Commission, eu-LISA and Member States, to plan ahead.In 2020, the Agency took over the operational management of the ECRIS Reference Implementation (RI), marking the first milestone in the development of ECRIS-TCN, a new, centralised, hit/ no-hit large-scale IT system to supplement the existing EU criminal records database (ECRIS) on non-EU nationals (TCNs, third-country nationals) convicted in the European Union. Further to that, in June 2021, the Council of the EU approved a general approach on the EU regulation that foresees the long-term operational management of e-CODEX being given to eu-LISA. e-CODEX (e-Justice Communication via Online Data Exchange) offers a digital, decentralised infrastructure for secure communication between national systems, facilitating how users (judicial authorities, legal practitioners and citizens) send and receive documents, legal forms and evidence. More recently, on 1 December 2021, the European Commission presented a legislative proposal for a Regulation establishing a collaboration platform to support the functioning of Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) (COM (2021) 756 final). The general objective of the proposal is to provide technological support to those involved in JITs to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their cross-border investigations and prosecutions. According to the Commission proposal, the JITs platform design, development, technical management, and maintenance should be entrusted to eu-LISA. Background informationThe European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA), was established in 2011 as a long-term solution to the management of large-scale information systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, that became operational de facto in 2012. Today, it is at the forefront of Europe's information-driven border management and internal security, providing the expertise needed to manage and develop JHA large-scale IT systems and their respective communication infrastructure, on a 24/7 basis. The headquarters of eu-LISA are in Tallinn (Estonia), operational management is carried out in Strasbourg (France) and a backup site is located in Sankt Johann im Pongau (Austria). The Agency also has a liaison office in Brussels (Belgium). Contactpress@eulisa.europa.eu +372 605 2267 https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/ Meta Tags:   "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/PressRelease/Pages/Commissioner-Reynders-visits-eu-LISA.aspx

EULISA_PR_0010	2020-11-26	PR	eu-LISA - Interoperability as the Essential Building Block for Digital Resilience	" Page ContentToday, eu-LISA hosts its 7th Annual Conference ""Interoperability - Building Digital Resilience for the EU Justice and Home Affairs Community"". The conference is organised in cooperation with the German Presidency of the Council of the European Union and aims to tackle the top priority issues regarding digitalisation in EU justice and home affairs.  The focus of the fully digital conference is set on the paradigm shift introduced by interoperability while also reflecting on aspects of its technical implementation. The conference aims, on one hand, to explore how the JHA community can benefit from an enhanced focus on innovation & technology and, on the other hand, to touch upon the potential influence of innovation and the latest technological solutions to policy-making at EU and national levels. Possible implications from the COVID-19 pandemic on the acceleration of digital transformation, as well as benefits and possibilities for the law enforcement sector stemming from the new information architecture form another set of questions for discussions and reflections. The conferences is honoured by Commissioner JOHANSSON's keynote statement, emphasising that eu-LISA together with the national counterparts in all EU Member States are the backbone of the Schengen Area, making the most cherished right of Europeans, freedom of movement, possible. ""Digital transformation is one of the building blocks of NextGenerationEU and eu-LISA is the Agency delivering the necessary digital platforms, to justice and home affairs communities, that provide tangible benefits for EU citizens, enabling the practical implementation of one of their fundamental rights –freedom of movement. We can be successful if we, all those engaged in these communities, see this as our common goal and work jointly to achieve it. It is therefore a great privilege for eu-LISA to organise this year's annual conference, with the German Presidency, and through common efforts reach a remarkable blend of stakeholder communities from all across Europe. At this conference we will discuss with EU policy makers, national experts and partners the 'new normality' we are all living in and how interoperability strengthens the digital resilience and the challenges we need to consider on our way to NextGenerationEU. With this exchange we build our common success"", emphasised Krum GARKOV, Executive Director of eu-LISA.  Backgroundeu-LISA Annual Conferences The Agency has established a solid tradition of organising annual conferences targeted at EU and national level stakeholders and experts. These conferences have grown in scope and partnerships over the years. eu-LISA is proud to have organised several annual conferences in partnership with countries holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.

EULISA_PR_0011	2021-10-11	PR	eu-LISA and Eurojust Consolidate Their Cooperation in the Justice Domain	" Page ContentEstablishing access for Eurojust to eu-LISA's new large-scale IT system ECRIS-TCN, as well as the Interoperability architecture that will strengthen the Justice and Home Affairs domain, is the foundation of the three-year Cooperation Plan signed today by eu-LISA Executive Director Krum Garkov and Eurojust President Ladislav Hamran. It also covers future cooperation in the context of the Digital Criminal Justice initiative and e-CODEX, a cross-border judicial tool that will be managed by eu-LISA starting 2023. The plan outlines detailed practical modalities of mutual support between the two Agencies.Eurojust President Mr. Ladislav Hamran said: ""Digitalisation requires cooperation, and Eurojust warmly welcomes the opportunity to join forces with eu-LISA on the important topics addressed in this Cooperation Plan. I am certain that it will prove to be a decisive next step in our shared efforts to bring cross-border judicial cooperation up to the standards of the 21st century.""Mr. Krum Garkov, Executive Director of eu-LISA, stated: ""Quick and efficient exchange of judicial information is paramount for the future development of the Schengen Area and of the European Union. The Cooperation Plan we sign today – which builds upon the foundation of our long-standing collaboration agreement set up in 2017 – will facilitate both Agencies' efforts in accelerating the digital transformation we are all a part of, and in increasing our contribution to the Member States, with the ultimate goal of providing tangible benefits for EU citizens. We look forward to consolidating our partnership with Eurojust.""ECRIS-TCN (European Criminal Records Information System – Third Country Nationals) will be a new, centralised, hit/ no-hit large-scale IT system to supplement the existing EU criminal records database (ECRIS) on non-EU nationals convicted in the European Union. As outlined in the Cooperation Plan, Eurojust will be able to query ECRIS-TCN for identifying the Member States holding criminal records information on a third-country national. Efficient exchange of criminal records information is instrumental in combating cross-border crime. ECRIS-TCN will contribute to implementing the principle of mutual recognition of sentences and judicial decisions in a common area of justice and security where people move freely, such as the Schengen Area.The Digital Criminal Justice initiative consists of a number of concrete measures aimed at further modernising cross-border judicial cooperation in criminal matters. It is one of Eurojust's key priorities and will help to minimise errors caused by the manual handling of data and overcome limitations in the sharing of evidence. As a result, links between existing cases will be identified faster and more efficiently, thereby strengthening the EU's efforts in the fight against organised crime and terrorism. Considering eu-LISA's expertise in the field of large-scale IT systems, cooperation between both agencies on Digital Criminal Justice could be hugely beneficial.e-CODEX aims to improve the efficiency of cross-border communication between European judicial authorities and facilitate access to justice for citizens and businesses. As part of eu-LISA's growing role in the justice domain, the Agency is set to take over operational management of the system as of 1 July 2023.The Cooperation Plan implements in practice the modalities of cooperation set forth in the Eurojust and eu-LISA Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2017. While the Memorandum of Understanding remains the overarching framework for the two Agencies' collaboration, the Cooperation Plan aims to outline specific actions in more detail, with a view to effectively and efficiently implementation specific actions, enabling eu-LISA and Eurojust to further enhance synergies in the Justice and Home Affairs area.Eurojust and eu-LISA have also agreed to share expertise and knowledge on ICT-related matters, as well on research priorities and findings. Furthermore, the Agencies may consult each other and exchange know-how on the use of artificial intelligence.The Cooperation Plan also defines principles when it comes to the consultation on strategic and planning documents, the planning and implementing of technical trainings related to SIS, ECRIS-TCN and e-CODEX, and the exchange of lessons learnt in the area of personal data protection, including security by design, data protection by design and by default. BackgroundEuropean Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA)eu-LISA was established in 2011 in order to provide a long-term solution for IT-driven internal security and to support the implementation of asylum, migration and border management policies in Europe. Since then, eu-LISA has run Eurodac, SIS and VIS and has been providing Member State authorities with the expert training needed to help them with the constant exchange of information across Europe. Thanks to the trust eu-LISA has fostered over the years, we are now developing EES, ETIAS and ECRIS-TCN and ensuring interoperability between all six IT-systems, in order to take EU internal security and border management to the next level. European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust)As the EU's hub for judicial cooperation, Eurojust delivers hands-on support to national authorities by promoting the exchange of information, developing prosecutorial strategies, facilitating the use of judicial cooperation tools, and implementing joint actions. Together with the Member States and an extensive network of international partners, Eurojust is making Europe a safer place for all of its citizens. Further Readingeu-LISA - Eurojust Cooperation Plan 2021-2023eu-LISA – Eurojust Memorandum of UnderstandingDiscover eu-LISAEurojust Virtual TourPress Release in PDF format Meta Tags:   "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/PressRelease/Pages/eu-LISA-and-Eurojust-Consolidate-Their-Cooperation-in-the-Justice-Domain.aspx

EULISA_PR_0017	2019-04-23	PR	eu-LISA Industry Roundtable Focuses on Seamless Border Crossings	" Page ContentOn 24 April 2019 eu-LISA (the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice) is hosting an Industry Roundtable entitled ""Making EU land and sea border crossings seamless and secure - operational solutions"" in Bucharest, Romania. The event is organised under the auspices of the Romanian Presidency of the Council of the EU. The roundtable focuses on the work of the Member State Working Group on Land and Sea Borders convened under the Entry-Exit System (EES) Advisory Group and explorse the group's findings and proposals on how expedited crossings of vehicles and pedestrians can be managed. The event brings together more than 100 representatives of the global border management and security industry to discuss legislative requirements, processes and technologies.  The Member State Working Group has examined and reported on requirements for practical technological solutions that can be deployed at land and sea borders in a unified way (Download the Report). The solutions should ensure the fulfilment of all EES requirements, particularly those connected with the enrolment and use of biometrics, while taking into account the limited time available for border control. In this manner, the solutions should be consistent with those already managed by eu-LISA in that they support Member States to ensure security while boosting efficiency. ""Today, for the 10th time, eu-LISA will facilitate a dialogue between the public sector and the industry. This round table comes at the right moment to contribute to the ongoing process of digitisation of border management. At the same time, considering the fast progress made towards implementation of EES, one thing is very clear - the time for theoretical discussions is over. Now we need practical and efficient solutions to enable seamless deployment of EES at land and sea borders of the EU. I believe that we will get lots of insights on them today.I am convinced also that the outcomes of discussions today, considering the huge work done by the Agency and the Member States to prepare this round table and the strong support from the Romanian Presidency, will contribute significantly to the successful implementation of EES"", said Krum Garkov, Executive Director of eu-LISA.Industry representatives will propose practical workflow solutions, outlining their views on how consultation of large-scale IT systems, biometric sample enrolment and verification as well as other necessary steps can be effectively accomplished.On behalf of the Romanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, Carmen Daniela Dan, Minister of Home Affairs,  states that ""Today's event will bring together both practitioners from law enforcement, including IT&C experts, and industry representatives with the aim of finding feasible solutions to the challenges that must be dealt with at the external borders. With the increasing mobility of persons and goods when emerging threats such as terrorism and organised crime are part of everyday life, we need to ensure the right balance between open and easy to cross, while at the same time secured and controlled borders. Law enforcement authorities must be provided with the necessary tools to prevent and combat all threats, to cope with any challenges that may arise, including through adequate IT&C solutions that are essential in ensuring effective border and migration management.""Presenters and speakers will include the European Commission, DG Migration and Home Affairs, the Chairperson of the EES Advisory Group as well as representatives of companies IN Groupe, IDEMIA, SITA, Secunet, Deloitte and Vancouver International Airport. Background:About eu-LISAThe European Union Agency eu-LISA, established in 2011, manages large-scale information systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. It currently operates three large-scale systems, namely Eurodac, the Schengen Information System (SIS) and the Visa Information System (VIS), ensuring optimal service to end users and continuously evolving the systems to meet new needs. The Agency therewith supports the implementation of the EU's border management, migration and internal security policies. The Agency is currently planning technical solutions to bring the systems towards interoperability with the final adoption of the legal basis expected in the near future. This means that authorised users such as police officers, migration officials and border guards will have faster, seamless and more systematic access to the information they need to do their jobs.eu-LISA has also been entrusted to develop  and  subsequently manage The European Entry Exit System (EES) and the European Travel Information Authorisation System (ETIAS).

Further to these, achievements and milestones reached in 2019 highlight that all systems ran without major interruptions and were available for over 99% of the time. The concrete progress achieved by both the SIS Expert Group and the SIS recast Project Management Forum will be illustrated as will the initial work on the second AFIS phase.In the afternoon an open discussion took place to identify areas in which eu-LISA can increase its contribution to Member States, look into the possibilities that innovation can bring in the context of Interoperability, the further digitalisation of the JHA domain and the Agency's part in the implementation of the new Pact on Migration and Asylum as well as its role in strengthening the Security Union.""The aspiration of the Agency is to develop further our common capabilities, at central and at national level, to turn the data that we have into meaningful information. The next step, once we have reliable and comprehensive information, is to find the best way to take that information to the officers on the ground in order to enable them to make the right decisions"" explained eu-LISA's Executive Director, Krum Garkov.Annual meetings with key stakeholders are always very productive and boost eu-LISA's constructive relations with Member States and partners. Building strong connections is of utmost importance to the Agency and vital to the successfully delivery of Europe's new Justice and Home Affairs IT architecture on time.Background:About eu-LISAThe European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) was established in 2011 in order to provide a long-term solution for the EU internal security and to support the implementation of asylum, migration and border management policies. Since then, eu-LISA has run Eurodac, SIS and VIS and has been providing Member State authorities with the expert training needed to help them with the constant exchange of information across Europe. Thanks to the trust eu-LISA has fostered over the years, we are now developing EES, ETIAS and ECRIS-TCN and ensuring interoperability between all six IT-systems, in order to take EU internal security and border management to the next level.The headquarters of eu-LISA is in Tallinn, Estonia, whilst its operational centre is in Strasbourg, France. There is also a technical business continuity site based in Sankt Johann im Pongau, Austria and a Liaison Office in Brussels, Belgium.Website: https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/ Social media: Twitter; Facebook; LinkedIn; YouTube Contact: press@eulisa.europa.eu Meta Tags:   "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/PressRelease/Pages/Sixth-eu-LISA-Annual-Meeting-with-JHA-Counsellors.aspx
EULISA_PR_0020	2019-05-16	PR	Today we placed the cornerstone of the new Information architecture for the Justice and Home Affairs domain	" Page Content​After almost two years of the most extensive and thorough preparatory work the European Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) and the winning tenderer – an IBM Belgium BVBA, Atos Belgium NV and Leonardo S.p.a. consortium - formalised the launch of the Framework Contract for the implementation and maintenance in working order of a new IT system, the Entry/Exit System (EES).  ""Today we reached a significant milestone for not only eu-LISA but Europe by large, signalling the end of the discussions phase and the beginning of implementation which will have an EU wide impact on border management and internal security. This is how our Agency starts building the solid foundations of a new information architecture in the Justice and Home Affairs domain, which will bring a range of new and extended capabilities for EU Member States and will facilitate a strong and timely response to the present challenges in the areas of border management and internal security that concern all EU citizens. We cannot accomplish all this alone though. We need strong partners as well as close and constructive cooperation with them. We are delighted that today, after years of dedication and hard work by our teams, to have found knowledgeable and experienced partners that I believe are capable of delivering under challenging deadlines and a complex scope of work, assisting eu-LISA to achieve a timely implementation of the Entry/ Exit System for the EU,"" emphasised Krum GARKOV, eu-LISA's Executive Director, during the kick-off meeting at the Agency's operational site in Strasbourg, France.The EES is one of the IT systems foreseen to shape the EU's new IT architecture that will contribute to the modernisation of external border management, help Member States deal with ever increasing number of travellers to the EU without having to increase the number of border guards as well as reinforce internal security and the fight against terrorism and serious crime. EES will electronically register third-country nationals visiting the Schengen area for a short stay. It aims to facilitate border checks, reduce delays and ensure reliable identification of over-stayers. The main users of the new IT system will be EU Member States' dedicated and competent authorities and Europol with a view to preventing, detecting and investigating terrorism as well as perpetrators or victims of crime. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) will have access to EES in order to consult specific data when risk analyses and vulnerability assessments are to be carried out. New Service Lines for eu-LISAThe Agency initiated the preparatory work related to the implementation of the EES back in 2016, in parallel with the process of the adoption of the legal proposal. This approach proved to be efficient and allowed for a smooth implementation of EES, as soon as its legal base entered into force at the end of 2017. Being a centre of excellence in the field of development and management of large-scale IT systems, the Agency is now responsible for implementing all the activities related to the development, implementation and operational management of the central EES as well as connecting Member State border infrastructures to the central EES. This will be done by the National Uniform Interface (NUI), which is identical across all Member States as it is based on common technical specifications. eu-LISA will not only develop this interface but also coordinate the  integration of the NUI by the Member States at their national level. In addition, eu-LISA is to host the other external interface of EES – the Web Service (WS) – which is to provide services to third country nationals wishing to verify their authorised length of stay. The WS will function also as a carriers' gateway to check if third country nationals with a short visa, issued for one or two entries, has already reached the number of entries authorized by the visa, or not. Both, the NUI and the WS, are new types of services which eu-LISA has not offered before. The overall ceiling of the EES Framework Contract is slightly over euro 142,000,000 for a maximum period of six years. Background:About eu-LISASince its establishment in 2011 and start of operation on 1 December 2012, the Agency has been a key stakeholder in the JHA domain and an essential part of, and net contributor to, the normal functioning of the Schengen Area. It has proven itself to be a reliable provider of operational services for the systems entrusted to it, making the systems operational 24/7 uninterruptedly and providing direct access to 28 Member States, 4 Associated Countries and selected JHA Agencies. It continuously evolves its systems to better serve end-user needs and meet changing policy demands. The Agency ensures the operational management of the European Dactyloscopy Database (Eurodac), the Schengen Information System (SIS) and the Visa Information System (VIS) and their respective communication infrastructures. In the coming years, the existing systems will be renewed/upgraded and new systems, namely the Entry/Exit System (EES), the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and the European Criminal Records Information System for Third County Nationals (ECRIS-TCN) will be developed and enter into operation.Further to the evolution and development of individual systems, interoperability of large-scale IT systems will also be developed and implemented. Interoperability and its components, namely the Common Identity Repository, the European Search Portal, the shared Biometric Matching Service, the Multiple Identity Detector and the Central Repository for Reporting and Statistics, will provide modern solutions to IT services.The headquarters of the Agency are located in Tallinn, Estonia; its operational site is in Strasbourg, France and it has a liaison office is in Brussels, Belgium.  Links:Website: https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/ Social media: Twitter; Facebook; LinkedIn; YouTubePress release: PDFEES promotional video: Enhanced Security with the Entry/ Exit System Contact: press@eulisa.europa.eu   Meta Tags:   "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/PressRelease/Pages/New-Information-Architecture.aspx
EULISA_PR_0021	2018-03-06	PR	eu-LISA successfully launches SIS II AFIS Phase One	" Page ContentAfter a little less than two years of intense efforts, the eu-LISA Internal Security Systems Sector successfully launched the first phase of the SIS II AFIS platform. The platform enables the identification of a person from his/her fingerprints alone.  The introduction of a biometric search capability in SIS II was achieved by eu-LISA in tight cooperation with ten Member States who showed both interest and willingness to use biometric queries once deployed at the Central System level. Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia will soon be followed by more Member States.The aim of SIS II AFIS is to allow all the Member States to leverage on a centralized policing-oriented database. As such, it will strengthen the fight against crime within Europe which is a mission we should bear in mind each day. Using the platform to locate those who either lie about their identity or changed it to avoid detection is paramount to Europe's security.SIS II AFIS Phase One entered into operation on 5 March 2018 at 22:00 CET. The entire project was performed without any deviation from the timescale and in full compatibility with the requests from eu-LISA's Governing Bodies.""This is an important milestone in the evolution of SIS II. With its new biometric search capabilities the system becomes an even more important platform for law-enforcement cooperation and information exchange. At the same time, this is a great achievement for the Agency as a whole, demonstrating again our agility and ability to deliver towards the needs of eu-LISA's stakeholders."" said Krum Garkov, Executive Director of eu-LISA.BackgroundArticles 22 (c) of the SIS II Decision and the SIS II Regulation have foreseen an evolution towards the normal law enforcement practice of comparing a person's fingerprints to the many sets of prints stored in SIS II ('one-to-many' search) to identify the person solely on the basis of his/her fingerprints. However, this can only be achieved by using an Automatic Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS).LinksSISII RegulationSISII DecisionSIS II Technical ReportContactsfor media requests:e-mail: press@eulisa.europa.eufor general information:e-mail: info@eulisa.europa.eu Meta Tags: SIS II; Cooperation; Member States; AFIS "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/PressRelease/Pages/eu-LISA-successfully-launches-SIS-II-AFIS-Phase-One.aspx
EULISA_PR_0022	2018-10-16	PR	eu-LISA and Frontex Joint Conference: EU Borders - Getting Smarter Through Technology	" Page Content​​​​On 17 October 2018 eu-LISA (the European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice) and Frontex (the European Border and Coast Guard Agency) will co-host the conference ""EU Borders - Getting Smarter Through Technology"" in Tallinn, Estonia. The event is organised under the auspices of the Austrian Presidency of the Council of the EU. The conference will focus on new trends, technologies and challenges in external border management, both from strategic and operational points of view. The conference will bring together some 180 delegates representing Member States, EU institutions and agencies, practitioners and industry.EU border management authorities have faced increasing challenges in recent years. Crime continues to be more international than ever, placing pressure on border authorities to step up checks in order to detect illicit activities; terrorist attacks have taken place on the territory of the EU that have involved sometimes extensive cross-border travel during preparations; some of the most vulnerable in our society continue to fall victim to human trafficking. Such challenges present at the same time as the flux across borders increases due to trade, business, work and travel.Technology is increasingly seen as a vital means to deal with the increasing demands on border authorities. In the coming years, at least two new large-scale IT systems will be developed and implemented - the European Entry-Exit System (EES) and the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS). Both systems seek to render border checks more comprehensive but at the same time more efficient. The systems will, inter alia, involve the use of biometric data to enable effective and rapid identity checks, the introduction of pre-travel authorisation processes to facilitate advance traveller processing and to remove some of the check burden from the first line border officer and the deployment of self-service technologies such as kiosks and Automated Border Control gates. eu-LISA is tasked with the technical development and implementation of both.""Today, we face a transformation of the Justice and Home affairs domain, leading to a rapid convergence between border management, internal security and migration management from an operational and a policy point of view. We can no longer draw border lines between them. At the same time, the impact of the ongoing digital revolution will continue and even accelerate in the coming years. Therefore, the EU should continue to further explore the capabilities of technology to make border management, internal security and migration management stronger and smarter.Although this all may sound too technological, if not technocratic, then I can assure you that in fact it is all about people. It's about how to best meet the expectations of EU citizens who are worried about terrorist threats, concerned with internal security as well as migration and expect our shared values, the values on which the EU has been built, to be translated into practical solutions and results."", said Krum Garkov, Executive Director of eu-LISA.Undoubtedly, use of these systems implies significant change in border control processes. Efficiencies will only become apparent if the systems are appropriately utilised, technologies appropriately leveraged and border guards fully trained to deal with all eventualities. Engagement with the border guard community to enable their anticipation of future developments and their input during their development process will be key. eu-LISA and Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, will therefore be working closely together throughout.""In order to effectively address the double challenge of increased travel and greater security needs, it is imperative we harness the power of transformation that innovative new technologies can offer,"" said Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri. ""Our discussions today centre on precisely those sophisticated systems that will help bona fide travellers enter the EU, while detecting those who represent a threat to our security upstream in order to take appropriate action.""Mike Flander, Head of Unit at the Austrian Federal Ministry of Interior, states that ""EU Borders – Getting Smarter Through Technology means Interoperability and means having the right information at the right time at the right place in a secure, reliable and trustworthy manner.""​Keynote speakers also include Olivier Onidi, Deputy Director General of the Directorate-General Migration and Home Affairs, European Commission. Experts from EU Agencies as well as from the public and private sectors of several countries worldwide will share their knowledge and expertise.Online web-streaming will be provided during the conference at www.eulisaconference.eu/streaming​ and a Twitter-wall will be available to enable interactive participation from all locations.The full press release is available in English.

EULISA_PR_0025	2017-10-16	PR	Going Digital for a Safe and Secure Europe	" Page ContentDigital technologies are driving progress and impact the ways that people meet, socialise, and work. Technologies are fundamental to the modern world by facilitating easier and quicker information exchange, enabling mobility and flexibility and supporting smoother processes without prompt. A worldwide digital transformation is well and truly underway.The extent to which modern technology can effect positive change is also evident in the field of Justice and Home Affairs (JHA). Law enforcement, border control and migration management increasingly rely upon modern technological tools to be effective. eu-LISA, the EU Agency responsible for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the JHA domain, is an important stakeholder in this digital transformation. The IT systems that it manages are key enablers for the community, allowing efficient information exchange and provision of accurate and reliable data to those on the operational front line. The Schengen Information System (SIS II), one of these systems, contains almost 75 million alerts that help law enforcement authorities identify people and objects of interest and take immediate action to safeguard citizens' security. The Visa Information System (VIS) enables secure and efficient processing of visa applications and effective border checks. It holds applications from some 48 million travellers to Europe. By managing these systems and cooperating with EU Member States and other system stakeholders, the Agency plays a vital role in supporting, through technology, efforts towards a fully safe and secure Europe.On 17 and 18 October, eu-LISA will host its annual conference, Going Digital for a Safe and Secure Europe, in Tallinn. Some 180 attendees are awaited, representing EU and national authorities, practitioners, industry and academia.  Keynote speakers include Dimitris Avramopoulos, EU Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, Andres Anvelt, Estonian Minister of the Interior and Krum Garkov, Executive Director of eu-LISA.  Experts from EU Agencies Europol, EASO, Frontex and FRA, as well as from the public and private sectors hailing from around a dozen countries worldwide come to Tallinn to share their knowledge and experiences.""A safe and secure Europe is a priority for the Estonian Presidency of the EU Council and for our Agency. That is why we chose the topic of this year's conference to reflect these shared values and to examine how going digital can enhance Europe's internal security. As practitioners we will focus on the hands-on aspects of digital solutions that affect law enforcement, border and asylum authorities, interoperability of IT systems and the use of mobile technologies to deliver security,"" said eu-LISA Executive Director, Krum Garkov.The Estonian Minister of the Interior Andres Anvelt emphasised that the Estonian EU Council Presidency seeks to put the various information systems to the maximum service for keeping the European Union a more safe and secured place. ""We will continue our work to make existing and future information systems in EU exchange data smoothly by 2020. Estonia is a good example of how interoperability on a national and international level has strengthened our law enforcement to be more efficient and has reduced the level of crime.

Further to this, it sets out the Commission's new approach towards achieving the interoperability of EU information systems for security, border and migration management by 2020. The proposed approach would overcome the current weakness in the EU's data management architecture eliminating blind spots. The EU Agency responsible for information system management, eu-LISA, would play a crucial role in providing technical expertise and bringing the work towards the interoperability of information systems forward. In order to allow eu-LISA to implement this new approach, the Commission will present a legislative proposal to strengthen the Agency's mandate in June 2017.Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Dimitris Avramopoulos said: ""The value of our security information is maximised when our systems talk to each other. The complex and fragmented systems we have today make us vulnerable. Actionable information is not always available for the law enforcement officials that need it. Today, we present a clear vision on how to act to correct this. To connect the dots and to eliminate blind spots to step up the security of our citizens across the EU.""Commissioner for the Security Union Julian King said: ""The recent tragic attacks in Europe have highlighted the importance of effective information sharing between Member State authorities. The approach we are outlining today sets out a targeted and intelligent way of using the existing data to best effect. What we propose would be a step-change in the way we manage data for security, helping national authorities better addressing transnational threats and detecting terrorists who act across borders.""According to the Executive Director of eu-LISA Krum Garkov eu-LISA has the knowledge and readiness to provide its expertise and fully contribute to achieving the objectives set out in the approach. BackgroundIn April 2016, the Commission presented a Communication on stronger and smarter information systems for borders and security and launched the work of the High-Level Expert Group on Information Systems and Interoperability. The High-Level Expert Group delivered its final report on 11 May confirming the views expressed in the April 2016 Communication, and putting forward recommendations towards the interoperability of information systems. The seventh progress report of EC takes stock of the recommendations of the High-Level Expert Group, and proposes the way forward to address structural shortcomings under the three main areas:maximising the utility of existing information systems;where necessary, developing complementary systems to close information gaps; andensuring interoperability between our systems.

EULISA_PR_0031	2017-06-29	PR	European Commission proposes eu-LISA be entrusted with extended tasks	" Page ContentToday the European Commission issued its communication on the Commission proposal to further broaden and enhance the role of eu-LISA in its management of existing information systems as well as of new systems to ensure that its mandate meets the current challenges in the area of migration and security on the European level.Europe faces a dual challenge today: to stay open whilst staying secure. To develop an adequate response to this the EU needs to utilize the capabilities of modern IT technologies parallel to using these to reinforce and enhance information exchange and collaboration between Member States. An adequate response of this challenge also requires eu-LISA to undertake new tasks. The ongoing digital transformation in the EU justice and home affairs domain has highlighted the need to further increase the added value of eu-LISA to the benefit of Member States and the EU as a whole. The EC proposal for a revised mandate takes into account the needs deriving from this transformation as well as the ability of the Agency to address them.A stronger mandate to enable interoperability""Four years after taking over its initial tasks the Agency has proven itself to be a reliable, competent and capable contributor to the Member States and the EU. It is able to take on new tasks in order to strengthen internal security as well as border and migration management in Europe. The Commission proposal to revise the mandate of eu-LISA is proof of that and I am confident that eu-LISA will be successful in implementing its new mandate and addressing the challenges ahead."" said Krum GARKOV, the Executive Director of eu-LISA.eu-LISA has demonstrated that by consolidating the operational management of large-scale IT systems in a single EU Agency significant efficiency gains can be achieved. This is attained through consistently pooling the infrastructure and the human expertise which is required for professional IT system management. The highly specialised knowledge of the Agency's staff is applied across all the entrusted IT systems, assuring their security, the protection of the data stored in them whilst enabling rapid evolution of systems in line with changes occurring in the information technology field. A stronger mandate would allow eu-LISA to perform necessary actions and develop technical solutions that facilitate the interoperability of the systems. The reform of the mandate will provide eu-LISA with the rights and responsibilities to develop and manage future large-scale EU information systems, which are necessary to efficiently support law enforcement cooperation as well as border and migration management efforts of the EU. eu-LISA will have an instrumental role in the development and handling of the new systems, currently under discussion by the co-legislators: the Entry/Exit System (EES) for modernised external border management and the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) to gather advance information on visa-free travellers in the EU. The EC proposal also foresees further upgrades to the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS), to improve the exchange of information between Member States on convicted non-EU citizens. The centralised ECRIS system would also be part of the IT systems developed and managed by eu-LISA. The capability of the Agency to not only administer large-scale IT systems but also provide advice and assistance to Member States on technical issues related to the existing or new IT systems, is a solid basis for the EC proposal to extend the mandate of the Agency. eu-LISA will have an enhanced role for the production of statistics related to the systems it operates as well as an extended scope of mandate with regard to pilot projects and research. It will help to improve the quality of the systems' data by establishing automated data quality control mechanisms.  Background:European Commission Press Release (EN, ET, FR) Contacts: for media requests: press@eulisa.europa.eufor general information: info@eulisa.europa.eu Meta Tags: interoperability; EES; regulation; ETIAS "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/PressRelease/Pages/EC-proposes-eu-LISA-be-entrusted-with-extended-tasks.aspx

EULISA_PR_0033	2017-04-21	PR	Commissioner Jourová Visits eu-LISA	 Page ContentDuring a two-day visit to Tallinn, Estonia, Vĕra Jourová, Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality met with the Executive Director of eu-LISA Krum Garkov. The main purpose of the meeting was to discuss the evolving role of the large-scale IT systems in contributing to safety and security in Europe and the expansion of the contribution of the Agency to the justice area. Commissioner Jourová and Mr Garkov discussed the impact of transformations in the area of EU freedom, security and justice, which has become increasingly reliant on modern technologies and information sharing. The Agency has managed to gradually increase its project portfolio from 10+ to 30+ projects on an annual basis, all management and systems evolution related. The Executive Director noted that eu-LISA has become recognised as a successful and reliable contributor to the implementation of Justice and Home Affairs policies and receives broad representation in the relevant working parties and committees in the Council and the European Parliament. Mr Garkov emphasised that digital transformation is ongoing in the entire EU public sector, affecting also the justice area. Innovation, digital transformation and information technology increasingly affect the way we manage EU justice and home affairs. The knowledge, experiences and capabilities that the Agency has already developed are based on acknowledged industry standards and hence they are neutral within the domains in which they are used and can therefore also be used in the justice domain. eu-LISA could assume operational management and the evolution of collaborative platforms for exchange of juridical information between the Member States. Since eu-LISA is the Agency that has a role in both EU values and modern technologies, the importance of eu-LISA for Member States and for the EU as a whole will continue to grow. The Commissioner and the Executive Director also exchanged views on the role the Agency will have after the revision of its mandate.Commissioner Jourova also took time to meet and speak to the staff of eu-LISA, with the offices in Strasbourg and Brussels connected via video conference.Links:eu-LISA: www.eulisa.europa.euCommissioner Jourova: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/jourova_enContact:press@eulisa.europa.eufor general information: info@eulisa.europa.eu Meta Tags: Cooperation; JHA 	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/PressRelease/Pages/Commissioner-Jourova.aspx
EULISA_PR_0034	2017-04-07	PR	Ukraine soon to benefit from visa waiver	 Page ContentOn Thursday 6 April, the European Parliament endorsed the visa waiver regime for Ukrainian citizens who will be exempted from EU short-stay visa requirement. Under the new law, Ukrainians who hold a biometric passport will be able to enter the EU without a visa for 90 days in any 180-day period, for tourism, to visit relatives or friends, or for business purposes. However, this does not provide for the right to work. The exemption applies to all EU countries, except Ireland and the UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.The legislation, approved in the EP by 521 votes to 75 with 36 abstentions, still needs to be formally adopted by the Council of Ministers. It is likely to enter into force in June, 20 days after it is published in the EU Official Journal.                                                                                                  Backgroundeu-LISA ensures 24/7 operational management of VIS's central system and its communication infrastructure. eu-LISA is responsible for the constant maintenance as well as the evolution of the system, while strictly following relevant security and data protection regulations. The Agency provides training to national authorities on how to use VIS, produces statistics and reports, and monitors relevant strands of research. As well as VIS, the Agency manages two other large IT systems: Eurodac – a centralised system that collects and processes the digitalised fingerprints of asylum seekers in Europe, and the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) – the largest IT system for public security and law enforcement cooperation in Europe. Contact:for media requests: press@eulisa.europa.eufor general information: info@eulisa.europa.eu Meta Tags: Schengen; visa 	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/PressRelease/Pages/Ukraine-visa-free.aspx
EULISA_PR_0035	2017-03-23	PR	eu-LISA: digitalization to strengthen security and justice	" Page Content On the week that marks the 60th Anniversary of the Treaties of Rome eu-LISA hosts the Heads of Diplomatic Missions and representatives of the European embassies for the annual briefing on eu-LISA's role and how it contributes to safety and security in Europe. Discussions in the headquarters of the Agency on 23 March will focus on the 2017 priorities of the Agency and those for the period of its possible new mandate.  Krum Garkov, the Executive Director of eu-LISA said: ""The area of freedom, security and justice has gone through a significant transformation in the last years. Today the pressure on it, as a consequence of irregular migration and terrorist threats, is continuously growing. At the same time home affairs are becoming increasingly reliant on modern technologies and information sharing. Moreover, the fast convergence between internal security as well as border and migration management is increasing the demand and expectations towards present and future technologies and IT systems."" Efficiently tackling the growing security risks requires joint efforts by Member States and EU institutional stakeholders, with Justice and Home Affairs Agencies playing an increasingly stronger operational role. Joint efforts should however be framed by action plans that are driven by operational demands and agreed upon between eu-LISA and the relevant JHA agencies to provide added value rather than overlapping actions. Thus, the eu-LISA 2017 priorities are related to the evolution of existing systems as well as preparing for the introduction of new ones. Both of these major task areas are associated with the revision of the Agency's mandate and legal proposals that are currently being negotiated at institutional level. Evolution of the existing and introduction of new systems The ""Communication on Stronger and Smarter Information Systems on Borders and Security"", issued by the European Commission on 6 April 2016, sets out eu-LISA's enhanced role in  interoperability of the existing systems to increase their efficiency. Following  the interim report of the Commission in particular, eu-LISA is now focusing on following interoperability dimensions: feasibility of creating the European Search Portal, exploring the technical and operational aspects of the implementation of shared biometric matching service, establishment of a data warehouse with anonymised data   as well as   exploring the necessity  and technical feasibility of the common data repository.  The current pressure from irregular migration and related increased number of asylum applications at the EU's external borders is not likely to diminish in the coming years. In this respect, Eurodac will most likely evolve beyond its current legal framework and become an even more useful tool to support the management of individual applications for asylum and monitor intra-community movements. This means eu-LISA will have to continue to implement necessary changes to the Eurodac system.Based on the proposal submitted by the Commission on the 21 December 2016, the Agency is also prepared to start implementing the necessary changes to SIS II once the SIS II recast regulations are adopted. In 2017, pending the adoption of the relevant legislative proposals, the Agency is expected to start developing the Entry/Exit System and the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS). The establishment of the Entry/Exit system is necessary to improve the quality and efficiency of border checks for third country nationals whilst helping Member States to deal with increasing traveller flows, without necessarily increasing the number of border guards. It is also relevant in ensuring the systematic and reliable identification of 'overstayers' in the Schengen territory. Above all, the new system will reinforce internal security as well as the fight against terrorism and serious crime.  The ETIAS will gather information on all travellers from third countries who are travelling visa free to Europe and ensure that possible security concerns are identified prior to travelling to the Schengen area, contributing to a more efficient management of the EU's external borders and improving internal security and the security of EU citizens. Backgroundeu-LISA provides effective operational management of the Eurodac system (a large-scale fingerprint database that assists primarily in the processing of asylum applications), the Schengen Information System (SIS II - the largest information system for public security and law enforcement cooperation in Europe) and the Visa Information System (VIS - a system that allows Schengen states to exchange visa data relating to applications for short-stay visas to visit or to transit through the Schengen area). In addition, the Agency is responsible for the communication networks that support the above mentioned systems. In terms of networks, eu-LISA is the communication infrastructure provider for Eurodac, SIS II and VIS. The Agency is also responsible for VIS Mail and DubliNet, the communication tools for the VIS and Eurodac systems respectively. In 2015 eu-LISA carried out, in close cooperation with Member States, the Smart Borders Pilot testing phase to test new technologies on the EU borders and provide decision-makers with information on the feasibility of deploying biometric identifiers at the Schengen external borders.Links:eu-LISA: http://www.eulisa.europa.eu""Communication on Stronger and Smarter Information Systems on Borders and Security"",ETIAS: https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-security/fact-sheets/docs/20161116/factsheet_-_etias_en.pdf Contact:Head of External and Internal Communicatione-mail: press@eulisa.europa.eufor general information: info@eulisa.europa.eu Meta Tags: Awareness raising; Cooperation "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/PressRelease/Pages/Diplomatic-Missions-visit2017.aspx

EULISA_PR_0039	2016-10-27	PR	eu-LISA “JHATech 2016”: focus on technologies to enhance European citizens’ security	 Page ContentIn 2015, more than 1.2 million first time asylum seekers registered in Europe, more than double that of the previous year. A 58% increase in regular leisure and business travellers to Europe is anticipated in the next 10 years, meanwhile, with 300 million travellers set to enter Europe annually by 2025.In the halls of Frankfurt, Brussels or Madrid airports, passengers transit through border checks using electronic gates. In Amsterdam and Stockholm, police on the beat check vehicle records using their mobile phones. Around the continent, incoming asylum seekers provide fingerprints to access European asylum processes. Europe's internal security is increasingly founded on modern technologies. Usage of innovative technologies is crucial to appropriately deal with the various threats faced, including terrorism, smuggling and cross-border crime, while enabling authorities to simultaneously cope with increasing flows of both regular and irregular travellers. On 27th October, eu-LISA will host its annual conference, JHATech 2016, in Tallinn. Some 130 attendees are anticipated, representing EU and national authorities, practitioners, industry and academia.  Together, they will examine the interplay between national and European information technologies and also assess research and development activities that might provide for new tools to enhance operations going forward. Opportunities to bring added value by making IT systems more interoperable will be particularly studied. The proposed European Entry/Exit System will also be discussed. This new system for the electronic registration of all entries and exits of third country nationals into Europe will, pending approval of the relevant legislation in the coming months, be developed by eu-LISA.Krum Garkov, the Executive Director of eu-LISA noted that the main emphasis of this years's conference is on the individual technologies for law enforcement cooperation and IT tools to enhance border control through interoperability of the available means.  Online web-streaming will be provided during the day of the conference at www.eulisaconference.eu and a twitter wall will be available to enable interactive participation from all locations (#JHATech2016.). BackgroundThis is the third conference organised by the European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (eu-LISA) to highlight the capabilities that modern technology provides to combine stronger security with ease of travel and thereby enable more efficient external border management in Europe. Linkseu-LISA 2015 Conference highlights see:http://www.eulisaconference.eu/2015http://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/VideoGallery/Pages/default.aspx Contactfor media requests: press@eulisa.europa.eufor general information: info@eulisa.europa.eu Meta Tags: Smart borders; interoperability; Annual Conference 	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/PressRelease/Pages/JHATech-2016.aspx

EULISA_PR_0047	2015-05-26	PR	The New Biometric Matching System Successfully in Operation	 Page ContentIn the morning of 21 May 2015 eu-LISA successfully managed the Entry into Operation (EiO) of the Biometric Matching System (BMS) v2.1. This entry followed extensive discussions and work carried out in close cooperation with EU Member States and proved that eu-LISA, together with Member States and partners, is capable of big achievements even in short timeframes.All the complex tasks related to the EiO were carried out during the last year and a half in close and efficient cooperation with Member States. This provided for the Entry into Operation without delays or interferences. In its first day of operation of the new platform, the Visa Information System processed successfully more than 550,000 transactions (close to 80,000 for BMS), which represents almost twice the maximum total daily amount of operations ever processed by the Central System. In comparison to the previous version, the current BMS has a significantly larger processing capacity, providing thus considerably better response capability to the additional capacity needs of Member States.As it stands now, the Biometric Matching System is able to provide full support for the final phase of the Visa Information System worldwide roll-out, foreseen to be completed in November 2015, and meets the business requirements of all Member States.Background: The collection of biometric data is a joint decision of the Schengen countries to better protect applicants against identity theft and prevent false identifications. Biometric data, along with the data provided in the Schengen visa application form, are recorded in the VIS central database. The VIS central database is secure and data will be processed in accordance with the highest data protection standards of the EU. eu-LISA is responsible for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of EU internal security and for the communication networks that support the systems. Contact:for media requests:Communication and Information Officer e-mail: press@eulisa.europa.eufor general information:info@eulisa.europa.eu Meta Tags: Biometric Matching System; BMS 	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/PressRelease/Pages/The-New-Biometric-Matching-System-Successfully-in-Operation.aspx
EULISA_PR_0048	2015-04-12	PR	The United Kingdom connected to SIS managed by eu-LISA	 Page ContentToday the UK authorities took the necessary steps to integrate into the Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS), the largest tool supporting law enforcement cooperation in Europe. This afternoon the UK authorities uploaded their first alerts without any technical difficulties. Over the next few days they will also be performing their first queries to the system. This integration follows the decision of the Council of 10 February 2015 laying the ground for the accession of the UK to SIS. To prepare the UK's integration to SIS at technical level, eu-LISA and the UK have cooperated closely since the end of 2013. From 1 March 2015 data-load activities were carried out to prepare the system for the go-live today (13 April 2015). In the coming weeks eu-LISA will carefully monitor the performance of the SIS Central System to ensure that the system maintains its performance following the successful accession of the new user.The Executive Director of eu-LISA Krum Garkov expressed satisfaction with the successful completion of the process that lead to the UK's integration into SIS enhancing freedom of movement and security in Europe. He emphasised the importance of real time alerts available to relevant national authorities and the exchange of supplementary information to fight cross-border crime, ultimately keeping all citizens safe.The UK is the 29th European country to integrate into the Second Generation Schengen Information System, which has been operational since April 2013 having succeeded the SIS I system established in 1995. SIS is the largest IT system in Europe used by Member States' police, border guards, migration, customs, vehicle registration and other authorities to combat crime. It contains alerts on persons and objects and allows further information sharing through exchange of forms through national SIRENE Bureaux. BackgroundThe SIS II provides for sharing of 'alerts' on five main categories of persons or objects: persons wanted for arrest for surrender or extradition purposes (mainly linked to the European Arrest Warrant); missing persons; persons sought to assist with a judicial procedure; persons and objects subject to discreet or specific checks; and objects for seizure or use as evidence in criminal proceedings. SIS II does not provide for a basis for sharing criminal records or various other categories of criminal law data. The system provides real-time alerts and instructions to officers on the ground about action to take. eu-LISA is responsible for running the SIS Central System and keeping it operational 24/7, allowing national authorities to constantly exchange and share information. eu-LISA is also responsible for implementing security measures, training national authorities on the technical use of the system, producing related statistics and reports as well as monitoring relevant research activities.  Links: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2015.***********.01.ENG http://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/Accession-of-UK-to-SIS-II-approved.aspx   Contact:for media requests:Communication and Information Officer e-mail: press@eulisa.europa.eu for general information:e-mail: info@eulisa.europa.eu Meta Tags: SIS II; Member States; Stakeholders 	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/PressRelease/Pages/The-United-Kingdom-connected-to-SIS-managed-by-eu-LISA.aspx
EULISA_PR_0049	2015-03-30	PR	eu-LISA organises “twin” media-briefs	 Page Content​eu-LISA, with its headquarters in Tallinn, Estonia, and the operational site in Strasbourg, France, starts its third year with complex tasks related to Smart Borders Pilot Testing-Phase to be carried out in 17 border control points of 12 Member States. In addition eu-LISA will hold the Chairmanship of 9 European Agencies, among them Europol, Eurojust, Frontex, that provide for internal stability and security in Europe. In order to elaborate on the eu-LISA 2015 priorities and challenges in delivering for secure borders and open EU the Agency held in March 2015 the s.c. twin media-briefs, one in the Tallinn headquarters and the other, for the very first time ever, at the Strasbourg operational site. The Executive Director Krum Garkov, Heads of Department and Units as well as research and security experts of eu-LISA discussed with media the tasks and timelines for the complex activities to be carried out during the year. eu-LISA is the European Agency for the operational managements of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. It is responsible for the management of 3 large-scale IT systems used by authorities in European countries, namely the Visa Information System, the Schengen Information System and the Eurodac system. Through professional management of these systems, continuous evolution and strong interaction with end users, the Agency ensures virtually uninterrupted availability of critical information to participating Member States on agreed high levels of service and efficiency.On 28th February 2013, the European Commission adopted the so-called Smart Borders package, detailing the proposed development of a European Entry-Exit System and a Registered Traveller Programme. The systems, which would only be applicable to non-EU travellers entering the European Schengen zone, are intended to improve security and efficiency at the external borders of the zone, to help to ensure that travellers abide by their terms of entry and to facilitate quicker and smoother border crossings. In 2014 more than 200 million crossings of ex​​​ternal borders were recorded and the number is foreseen to almost double in 10 years reaching the estimated 350 million by 2025.In order to further investigate the technical feasibility of the proposed systems, the European Commission proposed the organisation of a proof of concept. It includes a technical pilot taking as input the results and proposals of a Commission-led study on the systems.  The Commission delegated the delivery of this pilot to eu-LISA.  The active testing started in mid-March in Lisbon and will continue till mid-September. The cost of the pilot is €3.500.000.In 2015 eu-LISA is also to Chair the Network of European Agencies operating in the area of Justice and Home Affairs. Cooperation of these 9 Agencies, including also Europol, Frontex, Eurojust, aims to provide for efficient coordination and value-added input to stand against the core internal security risks of EU related to foreign fighters, cybersecurity, border control and violation of human rights. Interviews with the Executive Director Krum GARKOV, Head of Department Bernard KIRCH and eu-LISA expert staff were broadcasted in French and Estonian audio-visual media and information on the topics of the media-events were published in print and online quality media of the two countries.eu-LISA will continue with the media-briefs to provide timely and factual information directly from the top managers and experts of the Agency. Contact:for media requests:Communication and Information Officer e-mail: press@eulisa.europa.eufor general information:info@eulisa.europa.eu Meta Tags: JHAA; Smart borders; Stakeholder 	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/PressRelease/Pages/eu-LISA-organises-“twin”-media-briefs.aspx

EULISA_PR_0057	2014-09-24	PR	VIS to start operations in the Western Balkans and Turkey	 Page ContentAs from 25 September 2014 all Schengen States' consulates in the countries of Western Balkans and in Turkey start to use the Visa Information System (VIS). VIS is a central database for the exchange of data on short-stay (up to three months) visas between authorities of Schengen States. The main objectives of VIS are to facilitate visa application procedures and checks at external border as well as to enhance security. The European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (eu-LISA) is responsible for VIS in addition to two other systems: the Schengen Information System (SIS II) and Eurodac. The Agency manages VIS on behalf of its stakeholders who are the Member States and European Institutions in the benefit of the European public. eu-LISA performs its tasks by means of high-quality technology solutions to meet the needs of Member States most efficiently and securely for 24 hours a day and seven days a week.The introduction of VIS in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Kosovo and Turkey follows its earlier successful deployment through several regional waves since 2011. The last roll-out took place in May 2014 to Central and North America, the Caribbean and Australasia.  The system will affect only those people, who are under the visa requirement. For the purpose of the VIS, applicants will be required to provide their biometric data (fingerprints and a digital photograph) when applying for a Schengen visa.  The collection of biometric data is a joint decision of the Schengen countries to better protect applicants against identity theft and prevent false identifications. Biometric data, along with the data provided in the Schengen visa application form, will be recorded in the VIS central database. The VIS central database is secure and data will be processed in accordance with the highest data protection standards of the EU. Exemptions from the fingerprinting requirement are provided for:children under the age of twelve;persons for whom the collection of fingerprints is physically impossible;Heads of State and members of the national Governments, with accompanying spouses, and the members of their official delegation when they are invited by Member States' governments or by international organisations for an official purpose.Any person has the right to obtain communication of the data recorded in the VIS related to him/her from the Schengen State which entered the data into the system. Any person may also request that inaccurate data related to him/her be corrected and the data unlawfully recorded be deleted.Background on eu-LISAThe European Agency (eu-LISA) has been established to manage large scale information systems in the area of freedom, security and justice.  It fulfils the operational management tasks for the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), Visa Information System (VIS) and EURODAC.

EULISA_PR_0058	2014-09-28	PR	eu-LISA: New Technologies Strengthen EU Freedoms and Security	 Page ContentOn October 1st, eu-LISA, the European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, will host its first international conference in Tallinn, Estonia. The conference, 'Smart Borders: Faster and Safer Way to Europe', will be a forum for discussion and debate amongst practitioners involved in the evolution of processes and procedures at the external borders of the European Union. The main focus will be on the likely challenges that lie ahead in demonstrating the technical and operational feasibility of the proposed new Smart Borders systems during the pilot that eu-LISA will deliver in 2015 and later in the case of system development and implementation. Concrete plans for the coming months and the various testing and implementation choices will be analysed and all attendees will have the opportunity to contribute in order to ensure that future work is fully in line with stakeholder expectations.Smart Solutions at EU BordersThe Smart Borders proposals aim to deal with the changing realities of border control in Europe. Increasing volumes of travellers are putting pressure on existing processes and systems while security risks associated with cross-border activities and irregular migration are ever-more prevalent. Set against a backdrop of tight Member State budgets, there is an acknowledgement that technology may address these risks, facilitating more efficient border management processes and better traveller experiences.   The European Commission has proposed implementation of two systems: an automated Entry-Exit system that would allow the accurate and reliable calculation of authorised stay and the verification of individual travel history of third country nationals travelling to the Schengen area as well as enhancing security during border crossings; and a Registered Traveller Programme that will enable expedited transit for pre-vetted and pre-screened frequent travellers who choose to enrol into the system. Together, the systems should enable states to identify those non-EU travellers who fail to leave the territory when their permitted stay elapses, permit improved monitoring of transit patterns at their borders and through the use of biometrics, prevent document and identity fraud and enable flexible and fluid automated and manual border crossing. eu-LISA has a Clear Roleeu-LISA is playing a critical role in the assessment of the feasibility of these systems ahead of any future deployment. In particular, the Agency has been entrusted to deliver a pilot in 2015 that will assess suggested operating models and proposed mechanisms for system implementation in operational settings.   The mandate provided by the EU Institutions to eu-LISA recognises the value of the Agency's experience in the operational management of large-scale IT systems. The goal is to leverage the knowledge and expertise of the Agency and its staff in testing, system development and management to arrive at the best possible results that will guide future decision making  The October 1st conference is an important milestone in the overall process. At the event, a variety of stakeholders that will play a crucial role in the pilot and any subsequent development will gather to delineate the best path forward. Distinguished keynote speakers from the European Commission and the Estonian and Finnish Ministries of the Interior will set the tone for the event. Operational matters will be discussed in panels that bring together representatives from some of the diverse entities with interest in the future systems – national authorities, the border guard community and passenger and carrier representatives. All attendees will have an opportunity to complement discussions with their own views, thoughts and expressions of their main recommendations for the pilot and any subsequent work. The conference should set the scene for future collaborative work and establish agreement on some matters of crucial importance in the months and year ahead.eu-LISA intends to host annual conferences hereafter to focus on those issues of most relevance to EU citizens and under the responsibility of the Agency. We believe that such forums provide     the Agency with an opportunity to interact with its stakeholders and are one more measure that should help eu-LISA to continuously increase its added value to the EU and its citizens. eu-LISA Communication on the Conferencewww.eulisaconference2014.eucommunication@eulisa.europa.eu​ Meta Tags: Conference; Smart borders 	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/PressRelease/Pages/eu-LISA---New-Technologies-Strengthen-EU-Freedoms-and-Security.aspx
EULISA_PR_0059	2014-06-25	PR	Eurodac relocation successfully completed	 Page ContentOn  21 June  the  European  Agency  for  the  operational  management  of  large-scale  IT systems  in  the  area  of  freedom,  security  and  justice  (eu-LISA)  successfully  completed the  relocation of the Central Unit of Eurodac, the IT system supporting processing of asylum applications, from Luxembourg to Strasbourg and Sankt-Johann im Pongau. This finalised the procedure of transferring all the IT systems managed by eu-LISA to its data centres. The transfer of Eurodac to Strasbourg was a complex multi-stage process encompassing the exact cloning of the configuration of the Eurodac hardware and software for the Central Unit and the Backup Central Unit as well as data transfer by network synchronisation. The new system will run on a new infrastructure which will ensure better reliability of the system and further reduction of the risk of data loss. This solution is highly cost effective as the next version of Eurodac, to be launched in summer 2015, will be able to use over 90% of the existing IT infrastructure.Until 21 August the initial Eurodac system in Luxembourg will continue to work in parallel to guarantee an additional fall-back solution. Thereafter it will be decommissioned and all personal data destroyed in collaboration with the European Commission who hosted the previous system. eu-LISA will remain in high operational mode and will continue to closely monitor the system's behaviour to confirm its stability.Background:EURODAC is the European Dactyloscopy (fingerprints) database. It helps to determine the country responsible  for examining applications for asylum and for looking after asylum seekers.The countries using the system  are the EU Member States  and non-EU countries Iceland,  Liechtenstein,  Norway and Switzerland.  Meta Tags: Operational Management; Eurodac Related Links:Factsheet - Annual report on the 2013 activities of EURODAC Annual report on the 2013 activities of EURODAC 	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/PressRelease/Pages/Eurodac-relocation-successfully-completed.aspx

The conference will take place on October 1st in Tallinn, Estonia. ""eu-LISA is happy to host more than 100 experts and practitioners to discuss the  innovative and practical  means to facilitate more efficient border management and offer better traveller experiences when crossing the EU's  external borders. We regard the fact that the EC and EU Member States have entrusted us to carry out the pilot on the Smart Borders initiative as a great responsibility but also an acknowledgement of the Agency's successful performance to date. The pilot aims to test particular elements of the technical solutions for the Entry-Exit System and Registered Traveller Program proposed by the European Commission, and its outcomes will be crucial for further decision-making regarding the actual development of the systems, pending the passing of the relevant legislation"", emphasised eu-LISA Executive Director Mr Krum GARKOV.Stakeholders, practitioners and experts from 25 European countries will gather at the conference to discuss practical aspects of the implementation of the proposed new systems at both national and European levels. Under the Smart Borders initiative, enhanced use of new technologies for border checks is proposed as a means of addressing the needs of travellers and helping the responsible authorities. Time-consuming practices based on stamping passports would be eliminated and greater accuracy and reliability during border checks should be assured through the introduction of biometric ID checks. Such innovations would clearly lead to notable changes in the processes and procedures employed at all levels and operational and technical challenges that lie ahead will be outlined in panel discussions of the conference.  ""The EC Smart Borders Package might become a valuable tool for providing risk-based facilitation to a wider group of travellers. We should use the opportunity and take full advantage of the capabilities the technology provides to combine stronger security and more efficient external border management in Europe with ease of travel,"" explained Mr Garkov.The one-day conference will bring together delegates from European Union Institutions, national governments, corporate and non-governmental organisations.
