EULISA_NEWS_0009	2021-12-10	NEWS	Revised timeline for the implementation of Interoperability	 Page Content​In the margins of the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council held on 08 October 2021, eu-LISA provided a detailed report concerning the situation with the implementation of the Entry-Exit System (EES). The conclusion of the Agency was that, due to delays beyond eu-LISA's control, it will not be possible to meet the original deadline for the Entry-into-Operation of the system in May 2022 as planned. Subsequently, the Council gave a mandate to eu-LISA together with the Member States and the Commission to develop an alternative scenario for the implementation of EES and to report its conclusions to the JHA Council at the beginning of December 2021.Following two months of intense collaboration and cooperation with all parties involved, on 9 December 2021, eu-LISA presented the alternative scenario to the EU Home Affairs ministers gathered at the JHA Council in Brussels. Pre-conditions and key factors taken into account in the alternative scenario include:The overall unchanged deadline for the implementation of the new interoperability architecture by the end of 2023;The allocation of reasonable time for the implementation of planned activities at European and national level;The inclusion of all the Interoperability architecture building blocks (EES, ETIAS, Interoperability components, ECRIS-TCN and SIS);The summer, Christmas and New Year periods should be avoided as times for Entry-into-Operations of new systems that affect borders;The newly devised scenario has met with the approval of eu-LISA's governance bodies as well as that of the European Commission, and was also endorsed by the Council yesterday.The new timeline foresees that the Entry-into-Operation of the Entry/Exit System (EES) will be postponed from May 2022 to the end September 2022, the European Travel Information Authorisation System (ETIAS) from December 2022 to mid-May 2023 and the revised Schengen Information System (SIS) from February 2022 to June 2022. The final deadline for the full implementation of interoperability, end of 2023, remains unchanged.The new scenario however is demanding towards all stakeholders involved in its implementation. There are a high number of tasks that have to be executed in parallel and a limited margin for setbacks. Though it involves a range of risks, it is important to emphasize that, considering the complexity of the work at stake, a risk-free scenario does not exist.The substantial progress made so far, despite the various challenges and difficulties that eu-LISA and the Member States have had to face highlights that, collectively, all parties have the ability to successfully deliver the most complex global transformation programme for border management and internal security.

EULISA_NEWS_0010	2021-12-14	NEWS	Schengen: New rules to make the area without internal border controls more resilient	 Page Content​Today, the Commission proposed updated rules to reinforce the governance of the Schengen area. The targeted changes will bring greater EU coordination and better equip Member States to deal with emerging challenges when managing both the EU's common external border and internal borders within the Schengen area. The update seeks to ensure that reintroducing internal border controls remains a measure of last resort. The new rules also introduce common tools to manage the external borders more efficiently in case of a public health crisis, building on the lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic. The instrumentalisation of migrants is also addressed in the update to the Schengen rules, as well as through a parallel proposal for measures Member States can take in the fields of asylum and return in such a situation.Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, said: “The pandemic has shown very clearly that the Schengen area is key for our economies and societies. With our proposals today, we will ensure that border controls are introduced as a last resort, based on a common assessment and for only as long as needed. We are giving Member States the tools to address the challenges they face. And we are also ensuring we manage the EU's external borders together, including in situations where migrants are instrumentalised for political purposes.”New rules to promote effective alternatives to internal border checksThe proposal seeks to promote the use of alternative measures to internal border controls and ensure that – where they are necessary - internal border controls remain a measure of last resort. The measures include:More structured procedure for any reintroduction of internal border controls, with more safeguards Promoting the use of alternative measures Limiting the impact of internal border checks on border regions Addressing unauthorised movements within the Schengen area eu-LISA plays a key role in border management and internal security in Europe. With the IT systems it develops and manages as well as the foreseen Interoperability between them, eu-LISA ensures that both law enforcement and border management authorities have up-to-date unified European data at their disposal, making their jobs easier and Europe's citizens safer.Next stepsIt is now for the European Parliament and Council to examine and adopt the two proposals.Further Readings Full Press Release (European Commission) Proposal for a Regulation amending the rules governing the movement of persons across borders Proposal for a Regulation addressing situations of instrumentalisation in the field of migration and asylum Meta Tags:   	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/Schengen-New-rules-to-make-the-area-without-internal-border-controls-more-resilient.aspx
EULISA_NEWS_0011	2021-12-08	NEWS	Boosting police cooperation across borders for enhanced security	 Page Content​Today, the Commission is proposing an EU Police Cooperation Code to enhance law enforcement cooperation across Member States and give EU police officers more modern tools for information exchange. With a large part of criminals operating across borders, police officers in the EU must be able to work together quickly and efficiently. The Police Cooperation Code – which includes a Recommendation on operational police cooperation and new rules on information sharing – will help improve cross-border operations, provide clear channels and timeframes for exchanging information and give Europol a stronger role. In addition, revised rules on automated exchange of certain categories of data will help establish links between crimes across the EU much more effectively. This will help close information gaps, boost the prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences in the EU, and foster security for everyone in Europe.Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson said: “Our proposals today will solve very practical cross-border problems that police officers in Europe face every day. For example, what rules apply if the police has to cross an internal border chasing a criminal in a hot pursuit? Today, the police face differing and complex national rules, while with our proposals they would have a clear European framework. The police will also have better tools to exchange information they need for investigations, to keep us all safe from increasingly sophisticated criminals.”The proposed measures include:A Recommendation on operational police cooperationNew rules on information exchange between law enforcement authorities of Member StatesRevised rules on automated data exchangeeu-LISA plays a key role in extending police collaboration and internal security in Europe. With the IT systems it develops and manages as well as the foreseen Interoperability between them, eu-LISA ensures that both law enforcement and border management authorities have up-to-date unified European data at their disposal, making their jobs easier and Europe's citizens safer.Next stepsIt is now for the European Parliament and Council to examine and adopt the proposed Directive on information exchange and the Regulation on automated data exchange. The proposal for a Council Recommendation on operational police cooperation is now for the Council to discuss and adopt, after consultation of the European Parliament. The Recommendation would then serve as a basis for all Member States to update their existing national or bilateral arrangements.Further Information European Commission full Press ReleasePolice cooperation across the EU  - Youtube Video Meta Tags:   	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/Boosting-police-cooperation-across-borders-for-enhanced-security.aspx

EULISA_NEWS_0015	2021-10-24	NEWS	eu-LISA and Commissioner Reynders Discussing Digitalisation of the Justice Area	" Page ContentThe Executive Director of eu-LISA, Krum Garkov, met with EU Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, on 25 October 2021. Their discussions revolved around different aspects and activities aimed at fostering digitalisation in the European Justice domain and the increasing need to implement new digital solutions in order to modernise the judicial systems and improve their efficiency. Given that Justice is borderless, Europe should aim for easy access to cross-border justice for citizens, businesses and legal practitioners. Digitalisation in the justice domain should however be based on common principles that must be followed both at European and national levels. There is a clear need for a long-term strategic approach regarding the deployment of digital solutions in the Justice domain.""eu-LISA has a central role to play in the process of digitalising Justice, considering the broad experience of the Agency in the implementation of digital solutions in the realm of Home Affairs. The Agency is already actively engaged with ongoing efforts towards the further digitalisation of the European Justice area. eu-LISA is responsible for the technical maintenance of the ECRIS RI, is currently developing ECRIS-TCN and will also be taking over the maintenance of e-CODEX from mid-2023. These applications and systems are important building blocks that provide for a solid foundation in the context of the digitalisation of criminal justice,"" emphasised eu-LISA Executive Director Krum Garkov.As part of eu-LISA's growing role in the justice domain, in 2020 the Agency took over operational management of the ECRIS Reference Implementation (RI), marking the the first milestone in the development of ECRIS-TCN, a new, centralised, hit/ no-hit large-scale IT system to supplement the existing EU criminal records database (ECRIS) on non-EU nationals (TCNs, third-country nationals) convicted in the European Union. Further to that, in June 2021, the Council of the EU approved a general approach on the EU regulation that foresees the long-term operational management of e-CODEX being given to eu-LISA. e-CODEX (e-Justice Communication via Online Data Exchange) offers a digital, decentralised infrastructure for secure communication between national systems, facilitating its users (judicial authorities, legal practitioners and citizens) to send and receive documents, legal forms and evidence.

The report is a key building block of the EU Strategy on combatting Trafficking in Human Beings and serves as a key reference document for national authorities engaged in tackling human trafficking.""Human trafficking is a concept that should not exist in the 21st century. Our common response for such appalling crimes must always be zero tolerance. I am confident that, together, the nine JHA Agencies can redouble their efforts in supporting Member States in identifying and, most importantly, protecting victims and potential victims of trafficking"", said Krum Garkov, Executive Director of eu-LISA.During the Eurojust Presidency of the JHAAN, for the first time, a compendium was made of all different actions taken by CEPOL, EASO, EIGE, eu-LISA, Eurojust, Europol, FRA and Frontex, to reach out to victims of human trafficking at all stages of prevention, investigations, operations and legal proceedings. The initiative is a concrete result following the Joint Statement of commitment to work together against trafficking in human beings, signed in 2018. The JHAAN report of today aims to make Member States more aware of the Agencies' potential in helping the early identification and protection of victims. Furthermore, it encourages them to cooperate closely with the Agencies involved in this area and to build on their expertise. The report responds to one of the key actions of the EU Strategy on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings 2021-2025.The report is the result of a questionnaire sent to all agencies and the outcome of a meeting of JHAAN experts, hosted by Eurojust in June this year. It builds on two important strands in the process of investigating criminal networks involved in human trafficking, namely the early identification of victims and measures and actions for their protection. To do its part in identifying and protecting victims of human trafficking, eu-LISA has continued its work on the design and development of existing, but also new existing large-scale IT systems, such as the Entry/Exit System (EES), the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), and the European Criminal Records System - Third Country Nationals (ECRIS-TCN), as well as the interoperability architecture, to ensure that national authorities responsible for border management and security and concerned EU Agencies will have access to the necessary information when and where needed. New functionalities brought by the SIS II Recast will be paramount in the fast, cross-border identification of children and vulnerable people who need to be prevented from travelling, if that travel would put them at risk of becoming victims of trafficking.As part of its expanding role in the area of justice, eu-LISA also contributes to the Digital criminal justice initiative, aiming to enhance the necessary technical platforms to improve the exchange of information, and victims' access to justice.Established in 2010, the Justice and Home Affairs agencies' Network comprises of nine institutions: CEPOL, EASO, EIGE, EMCDDA, eu-LISA, Eurojust, Europol, FRA and Frontex. Together, they contribute to the implementation of EU's objectives in the fields of migration, asylum and external border management, the fight against serious organised crime, drug trafficking and terrorism, gender equality and respect for fundamental rights.   Further Reading Joint report of the JHA agencies' network on the identification and protection of victims of human trafficking Infographic JHAAN Coordination and joint actions Meta Tags:   "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/EU-Agencies-present-first-full-overview-of-actions-to-detect-and-protect-victims-of-human-trafficking.aspx

EULISA_NEWS_0021	2021-07-30	NEWS	“No More Ransom!” Launches a New Website to Celebrate Turning Five	" Page ContentThe No More Ransom (NMR) project, a public-private initiative designed to help people recover their ransomware encrypted files for free, has been backed by eu-LISA since its inception in 2016, as part of our Agency's ongoing partnerships in the cybersecurity realm. With eu-LISA's expanding role in the digitalisation of the EU's Justice and Home Affairs domain, the Agency is glad to be a part and support the NMR initiative.Five years later, NMR has a brand new website and currently offer 121 tools able to decrypt 151 varieties of ransomware. Available in 37 languages, the portal helped more than 6 million people recover their information to date and prevented almost 1 billion euro from ending up in criminals' pockets.Digitalisation has given us the freedom to easily access a world of information. Digital devices, such as personal computers, laptops and mobile phones, hold hundreds of thousands of different files, which contain important information about our personal and professional lives. Ransomware enables criminals to effectively hold all of that data hostage. Attackers use advanced encryption algorithms to lock the files and demand ransom for providing the decryption keys. Even if users pay there is no guarantee the hackers will be true to their word, thus the advice is to never pay. And this is where NMR comes into play. In addition to the predefined decryption tools, the portal's ""Crypto Sheriff"" can also analyse sample files in order to detect which specific ransomware infected them.No More Ransom was launched in 2016 by the Dutch National Police, our sister agency Europol, and cybersecurity companies M cAfee and Kaspersky Lab.Anyone can be a target of ransomware – So, what can we do?Regularly back up data stored on your electronic devices.Watch your clicks – do you know where a link will take you? Beware of attachments in emails.Ensure that your security software and operating system are up to date.If you become a victim, do not pay!

EULISA_NEWS_0023	2021-07-30	NEWS	Call for Expression of Interest - eu-LISA Industry Roundtable November 2021	 Page ContentThroughout November 2021, the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) will host its next Industry Roundtable – Artificial Intelligence in Large-scale IT Systems: Opportunities and Challenges.The event, organised in cooperation with the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the EU, will take place online, over four consecutive weeks (one afternoon per week: 4/11, 11/11, 18/11, 25/11), using a dedicated platform for virtual events. The 14th edition of the eu-LISA Industry Roundtable will focus on the opportunities and challenges for implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the context of the large-scale IT systems operated by eu-LISA. There is no doubt that AI will become an integral part of the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) area. There are a number of areas where AI can and will play an important role. First and foremost, in the case of customs, AI can be effectively utilised to support risk assessment in border and migration management. eu-LISA together with Frontex are already exploring the integration of an AI-based screening system within the scope of ETIAS, which will allow for automated profiling of travellers on the basis of pre-defined risk indicators and screening rules. AI capabilities are also essential in developing advanced analytics solutions. Here, one of the most prominent use cases is the Central Repository for Reporting and Statistics (CRRS), part of the Interoperability architecture. Within the scope of the CRRS, AI may be deployed in different layers: starting with a multilingual natural language interface, to supporting data quality assurance and advanced data analytics. AI is already deployed and will continue to be essential in IT infrastructure management, and in improving the energy efficiency of data centres operated by eu-LISA. The next edition of the eu-LISA Industry Roundtable will provide a forum for the industry and eu-LISA key stakeholders to exchange views on the developments of AI technologies of immediate relevance for the JHA domain, with a specific focus on the large-scale IT systems. The event will target the following applications of AI technologies:Advanced data analytics and forecasting; AI for advanced data analytics in IT operations;Privacy-preserving technologies for data analytics and AI;Biometric recognition technologies.

EULISA_NEWS_0024	2021-09-15	NEWS	Europe, Back to the Future	 Page Content​Each September, the President of the European Commission delivers a State of the Union address (SOTEU) to the European Parliament, presenting the achievements of the past year and the priorities for the year ahead. The EU agencies' network, which includes eu-LISA, follows the event closely and promotes highlights as well as key take-aways. Look for the #SOTEU and #EUAgencies hashtags to discover more. President Ursula von der Leyen delivered her 2021 State of the Union address on 15 September 2021. Notwithstanding the ongoing grip of COVID-19, Europe is looking confident that all EU Member States' output should be back to pre-pandemic levels by 2022. Looking forward, the Commission devised three sets of targets for 2030: Climate Law: cutting CO2 emissions by at least 55% (the overall goal is to make the EU climate neutral by 2050); Europe Digital Decade: the full digitalisation of public services, so that e-health and all other key services will be available online; in addition, 80% of citizen are foreseen to use digital IDs and have basic digital skills; Porto Social Summit: At least 78% of population aged 20-64 should be in employment, 60% of adults should participate in yearly training, as well as reducing the number of people at risk of poverty by a minimum of 15 million.Of particular interest to eu-LISA and its stakeholders are the recent Pact on Migration and Asylum, Digitalisation and the new Strategy for a stronger and more resilient Schengen Area.To ensure the effective management of the EU's external borders, increase law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and complete the enlargement of the Schengen Area, the Commission's strategy foresees fostering mutual trust in the common implementation.eu-LISA's role in the new strategy is as important as ever. The Agency's mandate, tasks and duties span all of the strategy's key areas. The Schengen Information System (SIS), set up 25 years ago to support Member State law enforcement cooperation and compensate for the removal of internal border checks, the expansion of Eurodac, the reinforcement of VIS and the future rollout of new systems (EES, ETIAS and ECRIS-TCN), along with Interoperability between them all are vital to the strategy's success. The operational management of these, and the foreseen taking over of e-CODEX from the EU's Justice domain, put eu-LISA at the forefront of the European Digital transformation. Eurodac, the European Asylum Dactyloscopy Database - collecting and handling the digitalised fingerprints of asylum seekers and irregular migrants -, is one of the focal points of the Pact on Migration and Asylum. The Agency will be responsible for transforming it into a new and modernised large-scale IT system. The new Eurodac will provide precise figures on how many applicants/ first-time applicants there are in the EU. Furthermore, there will be more accurate and complete data available, including information about the Member State responsible for each asylum claim, shifts of responsibility, a rejected application or a previously granted Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration.  Further ReadingEuropean Commission press release and dedicated page2020-2021 Achievements and Timeline Meta Tags:   	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/Europe,-Back-to-the-Future.aspx
EULISA_NEWS_0025	2021-07-27	NEWS	Bulgaria and Romania Gain Read-only Access to VIS	" Page ContentAs of 26 July 2021, Bulgaria and Romania have been successfully connected to the Visa Information System (VIS) for passive (read-only) access, allowing them to view visa applications and access e-mail services, allowing for smoother visa processing.VIS is one of many large-scale IT managed by eu-LISA in its mission of safeguarding the Europe's internal security. VIS facilitates the exchange of visa data between Schengen States, allowing national authorities to enter and consult data, including biometrics, for short-stay visas in the Schengen Area, with the aim of combating ""visa shopping"" and irregular migration.At the moment, Bulgaria and Romania are not part of the Schengen Area, however having read-only access to VIS will support them in the implementation and usage of EES, the Entry/Exit System, another large-scale IT system that will record entry and exit of third country national to and from the Schengen Area in order to increase automation at border checkpoints and to prevent irregular migration. EES, expected to enter operations in the first half of 2022, will also mean digitalising the current practice of manual passports stamping.The integration comes after both countries successfully completed a series of technical tests required to connect to the system. The project, managed by eu-LISA and covering design, development and testing of the passive mode at central and national level, kicked off in 2019. Bulgaria and Romania will be able to see the visa history of an applicant and to verify the validity and authenticity of Schengen visas issued by other Member States against the data stored in VIS, helping prevent fraud and fight serious crime and terrorism.Full access to the Visa Information System would become possible once Bulgaria and Romania would be fully integrated within the Schengen area. The European Commission has reiterated its call on the European Council to take the necessary steps for Bulgaria and Romania to become part of the single area without internal borders controls in the new Schengen Strategy presented in June this year. Croatia, another EU Member State that is not yet part of the Schengen Area, is currently in the testing phase and is expected to gain passive access to VIS in 2022.

EULISA_NEWS_0032	2021-06-30	NEWS	eu-LISA and the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the EU	 Page ContentAs of 1 July 2021, Slovenia will hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for six months, taking over from Portugal.The four priorities of the Slovenian Presidency programme are:Strengthening the resilience of the European Union in the areas of health, green, cyber and AI;The Conference on the Future of Europe, which began on 9 May 2021 and is expected to conclude in the spring of 2022;Strengthening the rule of law as one of common European values;Increasing the security and stability in the European neighbourhood.AI – Artificial Intelligence – will be a key technology in the near future that will help shape Europe's digital sovereignty; and safeguards must be taken in order to ensure ethical usage. In May 2021, eu-LISA hosted the first meeting of a new Working Group on Artificial Intelligence, that will identify use cases for implementing AI solutions in the large-scale IT systems entrusted to eu-LISA, to maximise the added value of the services the Agency provides to its stakeholders. eu-LISA will be happy to contribute developing  the approach to AI together with the Slovenian Presidency.Strengthening the security within the European neighbourhood covers two important aspects relevant to eu-LISA's core activities, namely the European Commission's New Pact on Migration and Asylum, and the amendment of the Schengen Borders Code, that governs the movement of persons within the Schengen Area. The new Pact on Migration and Asylum sets out improved and faster procedures throughout the asylum and migration system, as well as a balance in the principles of fair sharing of responsibility and solidarity. One of the key focal points with regard to border, migration and asylum management is Eurodac, a large-scale IT system managed by eu-LISA. Through technology, the Agency support the efforts of the EU and its Member States in keeping Europe open and secure.Throughout the years, eu-LISA has had strong ties with all countries within the rotating EU Presidency system and has made it a tradition to co-organise its flagship events together with the presiding country. Our latest Industry Roundtable benefited from the support of the Portuguese Presidency, while last year's Annual Conference was organised under the auspices of the German Presidency. For the 2021 Annual Conference, which will take place on 27 October, our partner will be the Slovenian Presidency. Close cooperation with our partners is essential in contributing to the achievement of Member States' priorities in the area of Justice and Home Affairs.

EULISA_NEWS_0036	2021-06-08	NEWS	eu-LISA to Extend its Portfolio with a New Large-Scale IT System	" Page ContentOn 7 June 2021, the Council of the EU approved a general approach on the regulation on cross-border judicial tool e-CODEX, which foresees handing over its operational management to eu-LISA, in order to provide a sustainable, long-term legal framework for the system.e-CODEX – which aims to improve the efficiency of cross-border communication between European judicial authorities and facilitate access to justice for citizens and businesses – has been developed by a consortium of Member States, who are in charge of its management until 2024.The draft regulation introduces provisions protecting the independence of the judiciary and details the governance and management structure to be implemented within eu-LISA.The decision was taken during the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting taking place 7-8 June 2021. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has put the spotlight on the need to, among others, speed up the digitalisation and interoperability of our justice systems. Providing our judicial authorities with a sustainable, secure system to communicate in cross-border procedures is an important step in this direction"", said Francisca Van Dunem, Portuguese Minister of Justice, during the segment dedicated to discussing e-CODEX.As part of eu-LISA's growing role in the justice domain, the Agency is set to take over operational management of the system as of 1 July 2023.e-CODEX – which stands for ""e-Justice Communication via Online Data Exchange"" – offers a digital, decentralised infrastructure for secure communication between national systems, facilitating its users (judicial authorities, legal practitioners and citizens) to send and receive documents, legal forms and evidence. The reasoning behind e-CODEX is that access to justice should not be discouraged by the complex variety of the different legal systems across EU Member States. The transfer of the system to eu-LISA is not an end in itself, as very soon e-CODEX will be ready for further expansion and will require the introduction of new security and interoperability features. As with all new technology, the implementation must occur hand in hand with the respect of fundamental rights, data protection and privacy regulations. eu-LISA will be responsible, among others, for technical development, maintenance, bug fixing, updates and support, as well as development of new features in order to respond to emerging requirements. ""eu-LISA is considered a newcomer to the Justice community, however the Agency is primed to contribute with its experience and capacity to accelerating the digitalisation of the justice domain. We look at e-CODEX not as a simple communication platform, but as a strategic building block in the overall digitalisation process"", said Executive Director Krum Garkov.  Read more Regulation proposal Council of the EU press release e-CODEX website Meta Tags:   "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/eu-LISA-Extends-its-Portfolio-with-a-New-Large-Scale-IT-System.aspx
EULISA_NEWS_0037	2021-05-10	NEWS	eu-LISA Hosts Its First Working Group Meeting on Artificial Intelligence	" Page ContentOn 11 May 2021, eu-LISA will host the first meeting of a new Working Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI), that will address the use of machine learning algorithms and AI in the context of the large-scale IT systems the Agency develops and manages.eu-LISA and the European Commission will present their initiatives, as well as recent and planned AI-related activities in the area of Justice and Home Affairs (JHA). During the second session, a traditional ""tour de table"" will give EU Member States the opportunity to highlight their expectations, their own AI initiatives, elements of national AI strategies and the overall approaches in their respective countries.The overall goals for the Working Group are to identify use cases for implementing AI solutions in the large-scale IT systems entrusted to eu-LISA, as to maximise the added value of the services the Agency provides to its stakeholders, and to facilitate the development of a common approach for the use of AI-based solutions.AI should become a practical support mechanism for law enforcement practitioners, and bolster Europe's internal security. However, despite the fact that AI is based on algorithms, the main implementation challenges, in the law enforcement context, are not technical, but rather about finding the right balance between AI and data protection, data privacy and fundamental rights.In 2020, eu-LISA published a research and technology monitoring report on potential uses of AI in the operational management of large-scale IT systems: Factsheet • Full Report.In April 2021, the European Commission proposed a regulation for AI, titled ""Europe fit for the Digital Age"".

EULISA_NEWS_0039	2021-06-02	NEWS	Towards a stronger and more resilient Schengen area	 Page ContentToday, the European Commission presented a new Strategy to make – the Schengen area – stronger and more resilient.The Schengen area, as the largest free travel area in the world, is home to more than 420 million people across 26 countries. The removal, 36 years ago, of internal border controls between Schengen States is now an integral part of the European way of life. People have built their lives around the freedoms offered by the Schengen area, with 3.5 million people crossing between Schengen States every day.The free flow of people, goods and services is at the heart of the European Union and is key to Europe's recovery after the pandemic. Today's Strategy takes stock of the challenges faced by the Schengen area in recent years, and sets a path forward that maintains the benefits of Schengen. Still, common action is needed at Union level for Member States to cope with today's challenges.The Strategy aims to: Ensure effective management of the EU's external bordersReinforce the Schengen area internallyImprove preparedness and governanceUnderpinning a sound functioning of the Schengen area are three pillars: effective management of the EU's external borders, strengthening internal measures to compensate for the absence of internal border controls, in particular on police cooperation, security and migration management, and ensuring robust preparedness and governance, including the completion of Schengen. To foster mutual trust in the implementation of the Schengen rules, the Commission is also presenting today a proposal to revise the Schengen evaluation and monitoring mechanism.eu-LISA's role in the new strategy is as important as ever. The Agency's mandate, tasks and duties span all three of the strategy's key areas. The Schengen Information System (SIS), set up 25 years ago to support Member State law enforcement cooperation and compensate for the removal of internal border checks, but also the recast of Eurodac, the reinforcement of VIS and the future rollout of new systems (EES, ETIAS and ECRIS-TCN) along with the Interoperability between them all are vital to the strategy's success. The operational management of these, and the foreseen taking over of e-CODEX from the EU's Justice domain, put eu-LISA at the forefront of the European Digital transformation and makes it the Digital Engine of Schengen!

The Mayor assured eu-LISA that it could count on the city's support and that our presence in Strasbourg, as that of the other EU Institutions, is a matter of pride to her administration. Further to topics related to eu-LISA's premises, talks also focused on the possibility of boosting city transport services in the vicinity of the Agency and collaborating in various public awareness campaigns aimed at increasing local awareness of eu-LISA's direct and indirect contribution to both the local community and the European Union as a whole.eu-LISA sees collaboration with our host countries and cities as a vital part of our growth and integration. The Agency is always ready and looks forward to contributing to local initiatives and being an appreciated member of the community. Strengthening our relationship with the city of Strasbourg can only bring benefits to both parties.  History and background informationIn 2013, eu-LISA was given the former ""Centre du Système d'Information Schengen"" by the French government and has been running the Agency's large-scale IT systems from there ever since. Some renovation works and the construction of a new building in 2017 met the Agency´s short term need, to host the resources required to operationally manage three IT systems in 24/7 mode. With eu-LISA's  new Establishing Regulation, adopted on 11 December 2018, and the enlarged mandate to improve existing and develop new information systems for security, border management and migration that it brought, the lack of space and infrastructure on the operational site became more evident.Earlier that same year, during the inauguration event for the renovated site in Strasbourg, Mr Roland Ries, then mayor of Strasbourg, confirmed during his speech that the city would transfer the neighbouring land for the symbolic value of 1€.On 1 March 2019, the Strasbourg Council of the Eurometropole approved and signed the deliberation that confirmed the land transfer. From the beginning of 2020, with the assistance of the French Interior Ministry the formal handover has been prepared between the local authorities and the French state.The French authorities and the Agency signed the formalisation of land transfer of the plot adjacent to eu-LISA's current building-complex, the purpose of which is to host the extension of the Agency's operational site, on 28/09/2020. Further reading: •            eu-LISA to extend its Strasbourg site Meta Tags:   "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/Strengthening-Ties-with-the-City-of-Strasbourg.aspx

EULISA_NEWS_0056	2021-03-29	NEWS	Eurodac Statistics 2020	 Page Content​In 2020, as in many other areas, the COVID-19 pandemic had an effect on the overall usage of Eurodac, which fell by around 30% compared to 2019. This was as a result of the reduction in border checks and the travel restrictions imposed all over Europe.In September 2020, the European Commission presented the new Pact on Migration and Asylum, a major policy development which will pave the way for a profound evolution of Eurodac in the near future. The amended proposal for a Regulation on the establishment of Eurodac1 was one of the legislative proposals presented in the new Pact. The new Pact preserved the compromises reached on certain legislative proposals that were part of the 2016 reform of the Common European Asylum System, and added new elements to ensure the balance needed in a framework that brings together all aspects of asylum and migration policy. As soon as the proposal for a Regulation on the establishment of Eurodac is adopted, eu-LISA will work in cooperation with Member States to implement the changes in the Eurodac Central System.In 2020, an important work stream was the preparation, including tests and data deletion, of the disconnection of the United Kingdom from Eurodac. As per the legal requirement, this was carried out on 1 January 2021. The United Kingdom was still a Eurodac user in 2020, as reflected in the statistics in this report. The disconnection and related activities will impact the usage of Eurodac in 2021, in particular in the amount of fingerprint datasets stored and the amount of data sets transmitted in the year. Read the Full Report and/or the Factsheet.

EULISA_NEWS_0067	2021-01-08	NEWS	ENISA and eu-LISA - Cooperation for a More Digitally Resilient Europe	" Page Content​Within the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the current Recovery Plan for Europe put forward by the European Commission, the words ""digital"" and ""resilience"" are prominent and at times used together. When combined they bring to mind IT-related challenges that need to be addressed to ensure a stronger and safer Europe for its citizens. One of the primary concerns is cybersecurity; and, given that this is a topic of common interest to the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) and the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA), it gives the two Agencies further impetus to work together to face this growing threat.Earlier today Executive Directors Juhan Lepassaar (ENISA) and Krum Garkov (eu-LISA) signed a multiannual Cooperation Plan. The plan sets out activities that will provide benefits through joint actions to the Agencies themselves and to the EU Member States.The three-year Cooperation Plan complements the existing regulations applicable to ENISA and eu-LISA, and lays out various actions within complimentary areas that the Agencies can draw benefits from by sharing knowledge, information and expertise. Information Security, Business Continuity, Research, Data Protection and Corporate Quality Management are among the priority areas identified for collaboration.ENISA Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar ""Securing our digital future is facilitated by sharing knowledge and expertise. This Cooperation Plan will allow our Agencies to find solutions together.""""With cybersecurity and digital resilience high on the European agenda for the coming years, it seems fitting to take the opportunity to strengthen our cooperation with ENISA and to boost our common contributions to the goals set for Europe's digital future. There are many areas where our respective consolidated expertise can be put to good use. The EU Cybersecurity Strategy, adopted by the Commission in December, is one of these and the fast changing landscape of cyber threats including the ensuing need to secure common cyber spaces are examples of where we can mutually assist each other. This renewed agreement is the best way to kick-off 2021 and eu-LISA is looking forward to extending its relationship with ENISA."" said Krum Garkov, Executive Director of eu-LISA.It is in the common interest of both Agencies to promote and share activities with their stakeholders and the general public in order to provide increased visibility and further improve awareness of their respective responsibilities and joint successes. For this reason, the Cooperation Plan includes core activity related plans, as well as communication and information sharing as important areas for joint actions.Further Information: The EU CyberSecurity Strategy eu-LISA Regulation Discover eu-LISA ENISA website Cybersecurity ActJoint News ItemFor questions related to press and interviews, please contact press (at) enisa.europa.eu and press (at) eulisa.europa.eu Meta Tags:   "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/ENISA-and-euLISA-Cooperation-for-a-More-Digitally-Resilient-Europe.aspx
EULISA_NEWS_0068	2021-01-26	NEWS	A busy year ahead for eu-LISA and its Management Board	" Page Content​Today the eu-LISA Management Board convenes digitally to carry out its first meeting of 2021 and immediately starts, hands-on, to keep the pace and focus needed to efficiently implement the priorities of the Agency, in coordination with the Member States, other Justice and Home Affairs Agencies and the European Commission.The Board will mainly concentrate on the implementation status of EES, ETIAS, Interoperability, ECRIS-TCN and the SIS recast, at both central and national levels.

EULISA_NEWS_0069	2020-12-15	NEWS	The digital transformation of internal security in the EU, AI and the role of eu-LISA	 Page Content​By Krum Garkov, Executive Director of eu-LISAThe ongoing digital transformation of internal security is a fact – today efficient internal security means information driven internal security. In addition, the COVID crisis only accelerated the digital transformation of traditional business models and internal security is no exception to this trend. Furthermore, if digital technologies are the engine of modern internal security, then the fuel of that engine is data. This is why utilizing big data for the purposes of internal security is a new paradigm to achieve better efficiency in the work of law enforcement officers.Better efficiency is necessary because, in the long, run the nature and range of security threats will only grow. At the same time, it is unlikely that in the coming years there will be a substantial increase of the workforce engaged in the area of internal security.Utilizing big data only though, will not be enough. Data is just the raw material. What really matters is the information created from it and put in the hands of practitioners, enabling them to take better and informed decisions.However, the volumes of data and information are constantly growing and that trend will continue in the future. To avoid being flooded with raw data and information, law enforcement practitioners should be provided with a better tool set to handle it. This is where the role of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions come in.AI is one of the most promising disruptive technologies that could create tangible benefits in the area of internal security. It could enable law enforcement practitioners to follow an integrated and risk-based approach to address present and future security threats. Hence, the question is not whether to adopt AI but when and how…In the EU, the great potential of AI for internal security has been recognised and has become a political and operational priority, reflected in the EU Security Union Strategy.eu-LISA has also recognised the potential of AI and is pro-actively looking for ways to implement it practically in the areas of the Agency's responsibilities as per its mandate and in its day-to-day operations. At the same time, the Agency does not look at AI in isolation, but as an essential building block of the new information architecture for internal security and border management, currently under implementation by eu-LISA.In July 2020, the Agency published its research report 'Artificial Intelligence in the Operational Management of Large-scale IT Systems'. The report provides insight on the way eu-LISA can explore the potential of AI in its internal operations and for benefit of its stakeholders. Furthermore, eu-LISA contributed to several EU-wide studies that explored different aspects of the potential use of AI in the JHA domain, in particular:A study on opportunities for AI in border control, coordinated by DG HOME;An impact assessment on hosting a data space for Law Enforcement. In the context of the new information architecture for internal security and border management, eu-LISA identified several use-cases for implementation of AI-based solutions in the coming years:AI for ETIAS, to enable automatic screening of the travellers on the basis of pre-defined risk indicators and screening rules;AI for CRRS, to increase the analytical tool set provided to the Agency's stakeholders;AI for sBMS, to improve and enhance the accuracy of biometric matching algorithms;AI in the EU e-Visa Proof-of-Concept, presently under development at eu-LISA. eu-LISA is considering launching two additional Proofs of Concepts to explore the potential of AI in its internal operations:For the use of a virtual assistant/chat bot in its Service Desk; For the implementation of an AI-based solution for predictive analytics of IT infrastructure and/or network with the aim to improve availability of infrastructure and reduce failures and downtime.Last but not least, eu-LISA intends to establish a horizontal Working Group on AI, to further explore the practical implementation of the findings of DG HOME's study 'Opportunities and challenges for the use of artificial intelligence in border control, migration and security'. This would be done in the context of the systems entrusted to the Agency and the new information architecture for internal security and border management.At the end, I should note that while the implementation of AI solutions might look quite technical, in reality the main challenges are not technical at all. To me, the four main challenges that have to be recognised and addressed in order for the implementation of AI solutions to make sense and to provide tangible benefits, are:Political and operational leaders need to recognise the potential of AI and to promote and steer the implementation of AI solutions;A new balance between use of big amounts of data and data protection/privacy safeguards needs to be found. EU legislation needs to evolve and establish a framework for an ethical use of AI. At the same time, it has to match the evolution of technologies and the needs of practitioners.Substantial effort is required for training and capacity building to enable law enforcement practitioners to explore the benefits of AI fully.Trust needs to be built in society that the capabilities of AI will bring an important added-value and will be used for legitimate purposes.If these challenges are not recognised and addressed properly, the technical excellence of the solutions put in place will bring limited benefits.  In eu-LISA we firmly believe that AI is an indispensable building block of the ongoing digital transformation and that its potential and capabilities should be explored without delay. The Agency is committed to this journey and prepared to play a pro-active role in it. At the same time, it is clear that the proper implementation of AI for internal security in the EU can only be achieved as a collective exercise and should be based on synergies and complementarities between all involved actors, and close collaboration between the public and private sectors.

EULISA_NEWS_0071	2020-11-20	NEWS	EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies put focus on digitalisation	 Page Content​The EU's Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) agencies are stepping up their mutual cooperation on digitalisation. Earlier today, the Heads of JHA Agencies came together for a virtual annual meeting, chaired by Eurojust, where they had a first exchange on Artificial Intelligence and digital capacity building, training tools and innovative learning. With the COVID-19 pandemic having served as a catalyst for teleworking and videoconferencing, the agencies agreed to explore avenues for closer cooperation in order to shape the digital future of law enforcement, border management and justice that respects fundamental rights.All JHA agencies have been able to continue their operational activities during the COVID-19 pandemic with the help of readily available digital and online communication tools. The pandemic has given new insights into how these virtual ways of working can be optimised and, by sharing their experiences and best practices, the agencies now aim to make optimal use of existing capacities and expertise. At the same time, the increasingly important role of Artificial Intelligence in the agencies' operational activities calls for closer cooperation in this field to ensure that AI development and deployment does not negatively impact fundamental rights. eu-LISA Executive Director, Mr Krum Garkov said: 'At eu-LISA we firmly believe in the creation of common Artificial Intelligence capabilities that will allow internal and external synergies, as well as JHA domain communities to develop, test, and explore relevant solutions for the future.AI is an opportunity to be used to support our business needs and to complement and strengthen our work. It`s no longer a matter of if, but rather of when'.Following today's discussions, the Heads of JHA agencies agreed to draw up a list of upcoming challenges and opportunities for joint initiatives in the field of digitalisation. Aware of the resources that future digitalisation measures will inevitably require, they called upon the EU institutions to make sure that adequate funding is available. Eurojust chaired today's meeting and has made digitalisation a priority for the coming years. In close cooperation with the European Commission, the agencies will work towards the full digitalisation of judicial cooperation in the EU. With interoperability, secure online communication channels and innovative technologies as its key ingredients, this Digital Criminal Justice project is expected to also benefit other JHA agencies and help streamline interagency cooperation.

EULISA_NEWS_0075	2020-09-27	NEWS	eu-LISA to extend its Strasbourg site	" Page Content​Today eu-LISA reached another important milestone, which will allow the Agency to efficiently fulfil its tasks and continue to create and build, through digital technologies, next generation services in justice and home affairs realms for the benefit of citizens.The formalisation of land transfer of the 19 192 m² plot adjacent to its current building-complex, the purpose of which is to host the extension of the Agency's operational site in Strasbourg, was completed between the French authorities and the Agency. Members of the European Parliament and representatives of Eurometropol, the Strasbourg City Magistrate and the French Ministry of the Interior attended the ceremony in which the signatures were exchanged between Mr Josine CHEVALIER,  Prefect of Grand Est and Mr Krum GARKOV, the Executive Director of eu-LISA. The formal handover has been planned since the beginning of 2020, while the extension itself is a multi-annual project and is expected to be finalised in the first half of 2026. ""eu-LISA has been a part of the Strasbourg landscape since the beginning of existence of the Agency. Today, the close relations and cooperation that eu-LISA has enjoyed with the French National and Local Authorities and the EU Institutions have reached a notable milestone.  The transfer of land from the French State to eu-LISA ownership is a generous contribution from the French authorities to the future of eu-LISA. It is a clear and tangible demonstration of the values on which EU has been built. At the same time, it is also an important part of to the digital future of Schengen. eu-LISA will not simply manage more systems from here. With the extension of its operational site in Strasbourg, the Agency will continue to be the digital engine of Schengen and the enabler of the implementation of one of the fundamental right of the EU citizens – freedom of movement. Increased capacity at our operational site in Strasbourg will support eu-LISA in the implementation of its extended mandate - to ensure efficiency of management of the EU's external borders, internal security and migration management across the Schengen Area and beyond. Furthermore, our extended site will enable the Agency to broaden its service portfolio and to accelerate digital transformation in the Home Affairs and Justice domains and others. Our extended site in Strasbourg will enable eu-LISA to successfully address the growing expectations and demands of its stakeholders and to increase further its contribution to the EU and the EU's citizens"", said Krum Garkov, Executive Director of eu-LISA. History and background informationIn 2013, eu-LISA was given the former ""Centre du Système d'Information Schengen"" by the French government and has been running the Agency's large-scale IT systems from there ever since. Some renovation works and the construction of a new building in 2017 met the Agency´s short term need, to host the resources required to operationally manage three IT systems in 24/7 mode. With eu-LISA's new Establishing Regulation Reg. (EU) 2018/1726, adopted on 11 December 2018, and the enlarged mandate to improve existing and develop new information systems for security, border management and migration that it brought, the lack of space and infrastructure on the operational site became more evident.Earlier that same year, during the inauguration event for the renovated site in Strasbourg, Mr Roland Ries, then mayor of Strasbourg, confirmed during his speech that the city would transfer the neighbouring land for the symbolic value of 1€.On 1 March 2019, the Strasbourg Council of the Eurometropole approved and signed the deliberation that confirmed the land transfer. From the beginning of 2020, with the assistance of the French Interior Ministry the formal handover has been prepared between the local authorities and the French state.

EULISA_NEWS_0076	2020-09-23	NEWS	A Fresh Start on Migration - EC Proposes New Approach	" Page ContentToday, the European Commission proposed a new Pact on Migration and Asylum, covering all of the different elements needed for a comprehensive European approach to migration. It sets out improved and faster procedures throughout the asylum and migration system as well as a balance in the principles of fair sharing of responsibility and solidarity. This is crucial for rebuilding trust between Member States and confidence in the capacity of the European Union to manage migration.Following extensive consultations and an honest and holistic assessment of the situation, the Commission proposes to improve the overall system. This includes looking at ways of improving cooperation with the countries of origin and transit, ensuring effective procedures, successful integration of refugees and return of those with no right to stay. No single solution on migration can satisfy all sides, on all aspects – but by working together, the EU can find a common solution.Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, said: ""Migration has always been and always will be part of our societies. What we are proposing today will build a long-term migration policy that can translate European values into practical management.  This set of proposals will mean clear, fair and faster border procedures, so that people do not have to wait in limbo. It means enhanced cooperation with third countries for fast returns, more legal pathways and strong actions to fight human smugglers. Fundamentally it protects the right to seek asylum"".Stronger trust fostered by better and more effective proceduresThe first pillar of the Commission's approach to building confidence consists of more efficient and faster procedures. In particular, the Commission is proposing to introduce an integrated border procedure, which for the first time includes a pre-entry screening covering identification of all people crossing the EU's external borders without permission or having been disembarked after a search and rescue operation.This will also entail a health and a security check, fingerprinting and registration in the Eurodac database. After the screening, individuals can be channeled to the right procedure, be it at the border for certain categories of applicants or in a normal asylum procedure. As part of this border procedure, swift decisions on asylum or return will be made, providing quick certainty for people whose cases can be examined rapidly.Further Readings:European Commission Press ReleaseWebpage: New Pact on Migration and AsylumPact on Migration and Asylum: Legislative Documentation Meta Tags:   "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/A-Fresh-Start-on-Migration---EC-Proposes-New-Approach.aspx

EULISA_NEWS_0080	2020-07-24	NEWS	Connecting the Dots in a New Security Ecosystem	 Page Content​Today, the European Commission sets out a new EU Security Union Strategy for the period 2020 to 2025, focusing on priority areas where the EU can bring value to support Member States in fostering security for all those living in Europe. From combatting terrorism and organised crime, to preventing and detecting hybrid threats and increasing the resilience of our critical infrastructure, to promoting cybersecurity and fostering research and innovation, the strategy lays out the tools and measures to be developed over the next 5 years to ensure security in our physical and digital environment. This strategy lays out 4 strategic priorities for action at EU level: A future-proof security environmentIndividuals rely on key infrastructures, online and offline, to travel, work or benefit from essential public services; and attacks on such infrastructures can cause huge disruptions. Preparedness and resilience are key for quick recovery. The Commission will put forward new EU rules on the protection and resilience of critical infrastructure, physical and digital. Tackling evolving threatsCriminals increasingly exploit technological developments to their ends, with malware and data theft on the rise. The Commission will make sure that existing EU rules against cybercrime are fit for purpose and correctly implemented, and will explore measures against identity theft. Protecting Europeans from terrorism and organised crimeFighting terrorism starts with addressingthe polarisation of society, discrimination and other factors that can reinforce people's vulnerability to radical discourse. The work on anti-radicalisation will focus on early detection, resilience building and disengagement, as well as rehabilitation and reintegration in society. A strong European security ecosystemGovernments, law enforcement authorities, businesses, social organisations, and those living in Europe all have a common responsibility in fostering security. Research and innovation are powerful tools to counter threats  and to anticipate risks and opportunities.

EULISA_NEWS_0084	2020-06-12	NEWS	SIS-25: digital technology at the service of citizens for a secure Europe	" Page Content​This year we are marking the 25th anniversary of the Schengen Information System (SIS), the most widely used and largest information sharing system for security and border management in Europe. It is one of the largest IT systems managed by eu-LISA, aimed at making Europe safer.   Launched in 1995, as a tool for seven EU Member States, to support internal security and exchange of information between national police forces as well as border, customs, visa and judicial authorities, the system has expanded and had its functionalities continually improved to assist the national authorities of 30 European countries in sharing information with their European counterparts whilst performing border checks and confronting cross-border crime and terrorism.eu-LISA, responsible for the operational management and further development of SIS, has focused on improving and modernising the system for the past eight years, the period for which the Agency has so far been accountable for the IT systems for EU justice and home affairs. ""Free movement of people is one of fundamental achievements of the European Union. eu-LISA is an indispensable element of the Schengen architecture as, with its services and systems, it ensures the normal functioning of  the Schengen area, supporting with technologies the efforts of Member States to make Europe stronger and safer. Today, eu-LISA holds even broader responsibilities having been tasked to deploy the new information architecture of the EU for border management and internal security. However, digitalization is not a potion that can magically increase operational efficiency. It does not stem from the amount of money spent on novelties either, nor the excellence of the technical solutions implemented. It comes from the capability to make the best use of these technologies and the trust of citizens in the efforts of the national and European authorities towards a safer and more secure Europe,"" emphasised Krum GARKOV the Executive Director of eu-LISA.  Background:In 2018, eu-LISA launched the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), which introduced a biometric search capability in SIS, allowing for the identification of persons of interest solely using fingerprints The latest legislation foresees improvements within SIS to better address counter-terrorism and irregular migration. A more extensive use of biometric data and the creation of new categories of alerts, as well as the inclusion of more items in the already existing categories, is also foreseen.

EULISA_NEWS_0096	2020-02-19	NEWS	Commission presents strategies for data and Artificial Intelligence	 Page ContentToday, the Commission unveils its ideas and actions for a digital transformation that works for all, reflecting the best of Europe: open, fair, diverse, democratic and confident. It presents a European society powered by digital solutions that put people first, opens up new opportunities for businesses, and boosts the development of trustworthy technology to foster an open and democratic society and a vibrant and sustainable economy. Digital is a key enabler to fighting climate change and achieving the green transition. The European data strategy and the policy options to ensure the human-centric development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presented today are the first steps towards achieving these goals.The President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: “Today we are presenting our ambition to shape Europe's digital future. It covers everything from cybersecurity to critical infrastructures, digital education to skills, democracy to media. I want that digital Europe reflects the best of Europe – open, fair, diverse, democratic, and confident.”Europe as a leader in trustworthy Artificial IntelligenceEurope has all it needs to become a world leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that can be safely used and applied. We have excellent research centres, secure digital systems and a robust position in robotics as well as competitive manufacturing and services sectors, spanning from automotive to energy, from healthcare to agriculture. In its White Paper presented today, the Commission envisages a framework for trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, based on excellence and trust. In partnership with the private and the public sector, the aim is to mobilise resources along the entire value chain and to create the right incentives to accelerate deployment of AI, including by smaller and medium-sized enterprises. This includes working with Member States and the research community, to attract and keep talent. As AI systems can be complex and bear significant risks in certain contexts, building trust is essential. Clear rules need to address high-risk AI systems without putting too much burden on less risky ones. Strict EU rules for consumer protection, to address unfair commercial practices and to protect personal data and privacy, continue to apply.For high-risk cases, such as in health, policing, or transport, AI systems should be transparent, traceable and guarantee human oversight. Authorities should be able to test and certify the data used by algorithms as they check cosmetics, cars or toys. Unbiased data is needed to train high-risk systems to perform properly, and to ensure respect of fundamental rights, in particular non-discrimination. While today, the use of facial recognition for remote biometric identification is generally prohibited and can only be used in exceptional, duly justified and proportionate cases, subject to safeguards and based of EU or national law, the Commission wants to launch a broad debate about which circumstances, if any, might justify such exceptions.Read the full Press Release here:Shaping Europe's digital future: Commission presents strategies for data and Artificial Intelligence Meta Tags:   	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/Commission-presents-strategies-for-data-and-Artificial-Intelligence.aspx
EULISA_NEWS_0097	2019-12-20	NEWS	Third Working Group for Carriers Meeting in Brussels	 Page ContentOn 19 December 2019, in Brussels, eu-LISA organised the third meeting of the informal Working Group for Carriers, in collaboration with the European Commission (DG HOME). The meeting tackled legal, operational and technical aspects, in the context of the Entry/Exit System (EES) and the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) Web Services implementation. The Working Group for Carriers (WG) is an informal coordination body between eu-LISA, the European Commission, Frontex and carrier associations (for carriers operating at air and sea borders, and international carriers transporting groups overland by coach). According to the regulations, carriers will have to query EES and ETIAS and receive answers regarding the status of travellers. EES replaces the manual stamping of passports with an electronic record of entries and exits, and carriers will verify if a third-country national travelling to the EU with a short-stay, single or double entry visa has already used the number of entries authorised by their visa. Once ETIAS enters into operation, carriers will have to verify, prior to boarding, that their visa-exempt passengers have a valid travel authorisation. Information about the meetings' conclusions is published regularly on our dedicated page.

EULISA_NEWS_0099	2020-01-10	NEWS	New SIS II Release Successfully Deployed	" Page ContentA new release of the Schengen Information System (SIS II) has been successfully deployed earlier this week. Adhering to the new legal base, version 9.3.0 includes new access control features that enable Europol, Eurojust and Frontex to query all types of alerts in the system and perform fingerprint and extended search queries.SIS II acts as an information sharing system between all the countries that use it and holds information in the form of ""alerts"". Each Person alert can contain biographical information such as, name, date of birth, gender and nationality. SIS II can also store fingerprints and photographs of the person an alert is related to.In addition, Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) functionality for SIS II (initially introduced in March 2018) has been enriched with search on slaps – an alternate method of collecting flat fingerprints that helps prevent mistakes or fraud.SIS II is a highly efficient large-scale information system that supports law enforcement cooperation and external border control throughout the Member States of the European Union (and Schengen Associated Countries). It enables competent authorities, for example police officers and border guards, to enter and consult alerts on specific categories of wanted or missing persons and objects.

EULISA_NEWS_0106	2019-11-21	NEWS	The Nine JHA Agencies Discuss Joint Efforts in Building Interoperability	 Page ContentOn 22 November 2019, the Heads of the nine EU Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) agencies, including eu-LISA, met in The Hague, to discuss the state-of-play and the Agencies' joint efforts in building interoperability - an effort to link together the several information systems operating EU level that provide border guards as well as immigration and law enforcement officers with relevant information on security threats.eu-LISA LISA Executive Director Krum Garkov highlighted the ongoing preparations and future developments for the new JHA information architecture for border management and internal security. He noted that today the EU faces an important challenge: to stay open while also maintaining a high level of security. This is getting even more challenging as the shift from physical to virtual security becomes more apparent. Building interoperability is an iterative process, with multiple dependencies. Krum Garkov emphasised the need for continuous coordination and cooperation between the JHA Agencies, Commission and Member States, common standards in research and development, as well as a redesign of the work processes and procedures.The discussions of the Heads of the Agencies, hosted by the 2019 Chair of the JHA Network - Europol, also covered the implementation of the New Strategic Agenda 2019-2024 and common efforts in reinforcing diversity and inclusion in the workplace. The Agencies’ representatives have signed a formal statement to champion equality and ensure equal opportunities for all staff members while embracing their diversity. The outcome of the meeting, as well as different areas of cooperation and subjects relevant to JHA discussed throughout 2019, will serve for the drafting of a joint strategic report with recommendations for the EU Council on the future Internal Security Strategy. BackgroundThe Justice and Home Affairs Agencies Network (JHAAN) is composed of nine EU agencies: eu-LISA, CEPOL, EASO, Frontex, Europol, EMCDDA, Eurojust, FRA, EIGE. DG Home, DG JUST, EEAS are invited to the network meetings as observers. The Chair of the network is held for a year, on a rotating basis. In 2019, Europol has the Chair of the JHA Agencies Network.The network was established in 2010 to foster bilateral and multilateral cooperation among the JHA agencies working on a range of justice and security issues such as migration, counter-terrorism, information exchange, serious and organised crime, monitoring of drugs use and addiction, cybercrime and cybersecurity, fundamental rights, police training, gender balance.The network also aims at increasing the visibility of JHA agencies’ work in the implementation of key policy initiatives in the EU security architecture such as the European Agenda on Migration and the European Agenda on Security.

EULISA_NEWS_0109	2019-10-18	NEWS	Transversal - the new way of procuring at eu-LISA	 Page Content​In the coming period, eu-LISA plans to launch a procurement procedure for “transversal” services related to engineering aspects for the large-scale IT-systems it manages. This call for tenders will address the Agency’s operational needs in relation to the setup, development and evolutions of the European Travel Information Authorisation System (ETIAS), possible future large scale IT systems (e.g. ECRIS-TCN), interoperability elements and evolutions of existing large scale IT systems.This approach, which will be a new way of procuring for the Agency, aims to create a framework in which several contractors can work together, following common standards and practices, to create and deliver in an interdependent-systems environment. The collaboration between contractors that ensues from having to set clear responsibilities between themselves and agreeing to shared working methodologies will improve the coherence and transparency of the system deliverables. This will permit an improved management of dependencies and access control between the systems.Changing the way in which the Agency procures its technology-related services allows it to better tackle the challenges that derive from a growing, interoperable system landscape. As depicted in the figure (download here), the procurement and contractual approach comprises a total of two calls for tender:The first call for tenders consists of four distinct lots covering engineering aspects (engineering framework). The first lot (generic design and support lot) will cover the high-level design of systems and will assist the Agency with scheduling and quality assurance. Support with and coordination of the integration, training, transition to operations, and maintenance of the systems is also included in this lot; The second lot will encompass the detailed design, development and evolution activities (development lots) for the Core Business Systems (CBS) as well as for the shared and reusable components (including interoperability components); The third lot will provide infrastructure and platforms; The fourth lot (generic testing lot) will address testing across all systems;The second call for tenders will comprise daily operations and maintenance (except for evolutionary maintenance) across all systems (maintenance framework contract).Companies specialised in the above domains, are kindly requested to respond to the calls for tenders. The first call for tenders on Transversal Engineering Framework is planned to be launched in the coming weeks.The second call for tenders on Transversal Operations Framework is planned to be launched in the course of 2020.

EULISA_NEWS_0114	2019-07-26	NEWS	#NoMoreRansom turns 3	" Page ContentToday, the No More Ransom! (NMR) project turns 3 years old. As a partner right from the beginning, eu-LISA is proud to support this international initiative that has helped more than 200 000 victims of ransomware recover their files free of charge.There is far more to mark than a birthday! The following facts are worthy of notice too: Since its launch in 2016, the web portal has received more than 3 million visits from 188 different countries. This highlights the global nature of the threat and has driven to the implementation of NMR in 36 different languages.No More Ransom is the first initiative of its kind and a unique public-private reality. It is formed by more than 150 entities, like EU Agencies, law enforcement bodies and private companies that deal with internet security and financial services. This demonstrates a shared and common will to fight this type of crime internationally, a reality in which cooperation and shared information are key. The NMR project can now count on 82 tools, 14 of which added this year, that allow the system to recognize 109 types of ransomware-related menaces and keep 108 million US dollars' worth of profit out of the wrong pockets.For more details about the initiative, read about how everything started here: Cracking the code: How the EU protects our computers from cybercriminalsPREVENTION IS THE KEY However, even if the NMR online portal has considerably grown and developed in only three years, the best solution against ransomware is always prevention and be precaution. There are easy ways to do so:Firstly, back-up offline your digital files;Be sure to update your software and apps;Use reliable and strong antivirus programs;Be aware or ""strange"" links and attached files, and do not click on them if you are suspicious;And if you are a victim, DON'T pay the ransom, and REPORT it to the police.

EULISA_NEWS_0116	2019-09-19	NEWS	Second Working Group for Carriers Meeting in Brussels	 Page ContentOn 20 September 2019, in Brussels, eu-LISA organised the second meeting of the informal Working Group for Carriers, in collaboration with the European Commission (DG HOME).The event will facilitate the preparation of carriers for the implementation of their obligations stemming from the legal framework as stated in the Entry/Exit System (EES) and the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) Regulations.The Working Group for Carriers (WG) is an informal coordination body between eu-LISA, the European Commission, Frontex and carrier associations (for carriers operating at air and sea borders, and international carriers transporting groups overland by coach). According to the regulations, carriers will have to query EES and ETIAS and receive answers regarding the status of travellers. EES replaces the manual stamping of passports with an electronic record of entries and exits, and carriers will verify if a third-country national travelling to the EU with a short-stay, single or double entry visa has already used the number of entries authorised by their visa. Once ETIAS enters into operation, carriers will have to verify, prior to boarding, that their visa-exempt passengers have a valid travel authorisation.The first WG meeting took place on 4 June 2019.

The regulation will also contribute to improving cooperation with third countries on readmission by introducing a new mechanism for using visa processing as leverage.Under this mechanism, the Commission will regularly assess third countries' cooperation on readmission. Where a country is not cooperating, the Commission will propose that the Council adopt an implementing decision applying specific restrictive visa measures related to visa processing and, eventually, to the visa fee.On the other hand, if a country is found to be cooperating on readmission, the Commission may propose that the Council adopt an implementing decision providing for either a reduction in the visa fee, a reduction in the time to decide on visa applications, or an increase in the period of validity of multiple entry visas.

EULISA_NEWS_0120	2019-06-07	NEWS	A Leader of a Successful Organisation Knows that Progress Never Stops	 Page ContentKrum Garkov, head of the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) pursues objectives based on principles that are more difficult to follow than they seem. Novel technological solutions, a changing agency, a strictly regulated legal area and teams in different countries raise the question of how it all works.  What is your focus and mission?We are one of the agencies of the European Union that forms the basis of the Schengen area. Our services play a crucial role because without these Europe would not be what it is today. As a result, the work that I do is very exciting and provides many challenges.Last year the mandate of the Agency was extended, so now we have more tasks to carry out. In addition, we are now accountable for the implementation of several large-scale projects. All new IT systems put in place will enhance the capabilities of border guards, the Migration Board and law enforcement and will transform the information architecture of the European Union in the coming years. That is my mission.Another current focus is the transformation of the Agency, which is currently under way. Seven years ago, we started out as a small organisation with a total of 100 people and were accountable for three IT systems. Today, however, we are growing very quickly and by the end of 2020 the number of employees at the Agency is expected to be more than 400 people.Our activities are significantly more ambitious, a trend that is set to continue, including also the services in the Agency's portfolio. The prerequisite for all this is the fundamental modernisation of the organisation, because the agency as it was formed years ago is no longer able to achieve the new objectives. The transformation of the Agency will include its structure, working processes, operational model, competency and rolling out new systems as well as updating their supporting features.  Obviously, you now have a very exciting and challenging role?I do not know what the future will bring, but this role has so far been my greatest professional challenge. I have more than 25 years' experience of working in similar professions, more or less equally in both the public and private sectors. It is a coincidence that the IT agency is the fourth organisation that I've built from scratch. It is always interesting to compare experiences and I can confirm that right now is the most exciting time in my career.  Are speculations about computers replacing people at some point true, and does this affect the expansion of the Agency?This does not apply in our agency and I think it does not apply in a more general way either. IT and new technologies are powerful but neutral – they are not designed to replace anyone or to do something more or better than people can. They are made to support people in different activities and to improve their lives.I think the global trend of digital transformation will bring more efficiency in the way people work. We should not forget that IT, computers and artificial intelligence are invented by us. We therefore have the responsibility to make the best use of new technologies and capabilities, while making a clear difference between what IT can do and what a person can do. There is an ongoing discussion about drawing a line between a computer and a person, but no clear position has been reached. Replacing people is a discussion for the future, but right now that is a long way off.  Could you describe the Agency management as an international team?The Agency has teams in its headquarters in Tallinn, in Strasbourg in France and in Brussels in Belgium. It is certainly not easy to manage teams in different countries because the geographical aspect has an impact on the arrangement of work. However, this does not limit efficiency as technical means can be used to organise work. There are, however, no substitutes for face-to-face communication, which is why many employees often travel between our offices. We combine different ways and means to keep the team together. This is very important because we are an organisation with a mission and objectives that we need to achieve as a team.  Based on your experience, what are the common mistakes that are made in managing international teams?There are many things that can easily go wrong. The main issue is lack of transparency. All the members of an organisation need to understand what is being done and why. This is particularly important for teams working in different countries because there is a risk that everyone may not always have the same picture. Documented and comprehensive working procedures and processes are important as well. In order to correct and improve the work and to create success stories, feedback needs to be given. Feedback is also a tool for giving recognition and rewards.In order to keep the team spirit alive, it is essential to communicate face to face, even via a video call. I also consider it important to provide people with opportunities for development. The Agency is a public organisation and we do not have unlimited career possibilities, but we can create opportunities for development. Our work is very interesting and has a direct impact on the people living in Europe. A good example is the fact that EU citizens now regard freedom of movement and no border checks as standard. Without the IT systems for which we are responsible, the Schengen area in its current form could not function and freedom of movement, one of the main principles of the EU, would not be possible.  How do you find the right people for the team in the current labour market situation?This is indeed quite difficult. Our experience in the Agency has shown for a while that the situation in the labour market both in Estonia and in Europe as a whole is difficult. But the secret of success is not just about recruiting excellent people. We deal with IT operations and compete with private companies in the labour market. Of course, we cannot provide similar benefits and perhaps that is why we are not the most attractive choice for top talent, but we recruit people with potential and then invest in developing them. We have done this since the creation of the Agency and excellent talent has emerged from our staff. Developing talent is a way to cope with the situation in the labour market.  What do you think about Estonians as employees?I have made some positive observations about Estonians working in our agency. Estonians are hard-working, dedicated and frank. At the beginning we had a small staff in Tallinn and half of them were Estonians. Estonians have therefore played a very important role in the establishment and development of the Agency. Today we have an international team; as an organisation of the European Union, we aim for our staff to be diverse and have people from different countries.  Is the diversity of the staff always a positive aspect?On the one hand, a diverse team is a treasure because that way we can combine the experiences of different people which certainly benefits the organisation. On the other hand, cultural diversity is one of the greatest challenges that international managers have to face. People may, for example, interpret messages very differently depending on their cultural background and this needs to be taken into account in adjusting one's management style and communication. Otherwise the best of intentions may turn out to be a catastrophe.  What are the principles you follow when communicating with your teams?Communication is one of the key elements that helps keep the organisation together and is at the same time one of the most important management tools. We have made strong efforts to do it right, and direct communication is a large part of my work. Communication should always serve a purpose and aim to convey a message. Cultural aspects have to be taken into account when communicating and this needs to be done regularly rather than on an occasional basis.Communication requires preliminary work to be done in order to know your target audience. The staff of the Agency is one of our target audiences, whose needs I have to take into account as a manager. Our external target audiences have other interests that we need to be aware of in order to properly focus our communication. Whatever the field, a thorough analysis of the target audience is the foundation of successful communication – you need to know what to communicate and why and how to do it. In addition, the structure, frequency and consistency of communication is essential.We have a comprehensive communication plan for both internal and external target audiences and a separate strategy for clarifying changes. Last year, a commitment survey among Agency staff showed that more than 80% of people were in favour of change. People understand why change is needed, what changes and how, the impact on them personally and what their path is within the renewed organisation. I personally update staff on any changes happening on a monthly basis, and so do other managers. Honesty is, of course, important, and should be kept in mind even in difficult situations.  Start-ups name a flat structure as one of the elements of their success. What do you think about this?They are right, but a flat structure cannot be a lasting response to all management issues. A flat structure is appropriate for start-ups and smaller organisations because there is direct contact and ideas can be implemented quickly.However, every organisation reaches a point in its development where such a structure no longer works. The organisation would then have to rebuild and restructure itself. We have been in this situation, because we initially had only two levels of management: me and my management team and the rest of the staff. However, with the growth and development of the organisation this model was no longer sustainable because otherwise managers would have around 50 people in their teams and that would be unmanageable. We decided to add levels of management and we currently operate with four. Creating management positions at a lower level will provide talented employees with an opportunity to develop and become a manager. Managers should embrace the idea that change and progress are always there and there is nothing of a lasting nature in an organisation.  How difficult is it to implement changes in a public sector organisation?The activities of public sector organisations are strictly regulated, particularly in the light of EU institutions and that is why changes are indeed more difficult in that case. The rules we need to follow in our work are not particularly flexible or favourable for making changes. In the private sector, if the work of a person does not meet the needs and expectations of the position, that person's time in the organisation will be short-lived. However, the stability of the position is secured in a public organisation, which may, in certain cases, take the form of inefficiency in employees. We have to be very creative to make our resources work in the best possible way.  In addition to the fact that there is a shortage of labour in the technology sector, what other issues would you single out?For one thing, cyber security. People increasingly connect through technology, but this makes us more vulnerable to people and countries with bad intentions. Technology is developing rapidly, and in order to keep up with innovation, the organisation needs to develop this ability and make the right decisions.The lack of proper regulation is a concern. A good example of this is that legislation still lags behind innovation in the field of artificial intelligence and self-driving vehicles. This is also true for data protection because the power of technologies is in the data they collect. More and more data is personal and, when collecting data, companies have to follow increasingly stringent rules in accordance with the GDPR. Finding a balance is quite difficult here as this may enter into conflict with companies' business objectives.  Do you see yourself in the public or private sector in the future?The good thing about future is that I do not know what it will bring. It is always interesting to work on something new and exciting. I am confident that I will continue my role as senior manager but whether that will be in the public or private sector is yet to be seen. As my mandate ends in 2023, I will be with the Agency for four more years. So, I have time to think about what to do next!Garkov's CVKrum Garkov has been the head of eu-LISA since the end of 2012.

EULISA_NEWS_0130	2019-02-04	NEWS	Political Agreement for Interoperability between EU Information Systems	" Page ContentOn 5 February 2019, the European Parliament and the Council reached a preliminary political agreement on the Commission's proposal for two regulations establishing a framework for interoperability between EU information systems for security, migration and border management. The purpose of the regulations is to ensure that border guards and police officers have access to the right information when and where they need it to perform their duties, thus further closing security gaps.According to the Executive Director of eu-LISA, Krum Garkov, reaching a political consensus on the new regulations is an important starting point for eu-LISA. Developing the technical components that will make large-scale IT systems in the EU interoperable needs a solid legislative foundation to build upon.The new components will allow the existing and future EU information systems, such as the Entry/Exit System (EES) and the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) to talk to each other, preventing important pieces of information from going undetected. The new tools will:Crosscheck existing data with one click: A European search portal will allow border guards and police to carry out simultaneous checks of identity documents against all EU information systems on a single screen;Better detect identity fraud: a common identity repository, which will store biographical data of non-EU citizens will allow border guards and police to better identify dangerous criminals;Improve access for law enforcement: once the information searched by an officer matches information contained in one of the systems (i.e. gets a ""hit""), he/she will be able to request more targeted access, in line with the specific rules for each system;Protect fundamental rights: the rules on access and purpose limitation of the EU's information systems will not change, thus ensuring that fundamental rights remain protected.​​Next stepsThe two Regulations establishing the framework for the interoperability of EU information systems for security, border and migration management will now need to be formally adopted by the European Parliament and the Council.Once adopted, eu-LISA will be responsible for the development and the roll-out of the technical components that will make EU information systems interoperable.

EULISA_NEWS_0131	2019-01-21	NEWS	High-Level ETIAS Seminar held in Warsaw	 Page Content A High-Level seminar on ETIAS co-organised by eu-LISA, Europol, the European Commission and Frontex, took place in Warsaw on 21 January 2019.The aim of the seminar was twofold: 1) to raise awareness on the project and the various stakeholder roles and 2) to help Member States move forward with their decision making processes on organisational matters. Member State representation was high with representatives coming mostly from ministries, police and border guard forces as well as SIRENE authorities. Including participants from the organising institutions, there were close to 100 attendees.Krum Garkov, Executive Director of eu-LISA, explained that the meeting was taking place at the right time as the need to map out tasks and prepare is now. ETIAS, he noted, is arguably the most complex project currently underway in terms of border management and requires close collaboration. Mr Garkov emphasised that ETIAS was about more than technology, as it will change how border guards work and have significant effects on the travel industry as a whole.The European Commission emphasised the important work that Member States need to be ready for in terms of connecting to the ETIAS system whilst noting the pressure to complete developments within the set timeframe. Frontex expressed their appreciation for the support of the organising parties and their spirit of constructive cooperation that would be vital for further progress with ETIAS.Europol noted from the outset their full commitment to and engagement in the cooperative work to come on ETIAS, noting it to be an important milestone on the way to interoperability.Member States appreciated the seminar and the opportunity to compare their plans and readiness with one another with regard to implementing ETIAS within their national environments.A similar seminar will be held later this year during which further practicalities will be discussed and shared.  Meta Tags:   	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/High-Level-ETIAS-Seminar-held-in-Warsaw.aspx
EULISA_NEWS_0132	2019-02-26	NEWS	eu-LISA and #NoMoreRansom	 Page Content​No More Ransom (NMR) showcases the value of public-private cooperation in disrupting criminal businesses with ransomware connections. Victims should no longer be forced to either pay a ransom or lose their files. By restoring access to their infected systems free of charge, we provide users with a thirdchoice they did not have before.What is ransomware?Ransomware is a type of malware that prevents or limits users from accessing their systems or devices. The malware asks them to pay a ransom through specific online payment methods by a certain deadline to regain control of their data.The infection can happen in many different ways, such as:visiting compromised websites;downloading fake application updates or compromised software;clicking on malicious links and attachments embedded in phishinge mails;connecting infected external devices (e.g. USBs) to the computer systemWhat is No More Ransom?NMR is a public-private partnership between law enforcement and industry leaders launched in July 2016.Through www.nomoreransom.org, the project aims to:assist victims in the recovery of their encrypted files;raise awareness of the ransomware threat in the public arena;provide direct links to the national police agencies of the EU Member States and beyond to encourage citizens to report the attacks.How does it work?The victim uploads two encrypted files and the ransomware note to the NMR Crypto Sheriff.The Crypto Sheriff matches the information against a list of available decryption tools.If there is a positive hit, the link to the tools is provided. The victim only needs to follow the instructions to unlock their files.If no tool is available at the moment, the victim is advised to continue checking in the future, as new tools are added on a regular basis.Who can join the project?Official entities from all sectors bringing a unique skill set (an approval procedure applies).There are two partnership levels:Associate partner: providing unique decryption tools or decryption keys not yet available in the project portal. The signature of a dedicated legal agreement applies.Supporting partner: promoting the NMR project in their geographical area of influence or service, contributing material for prevention campaigns and translating portal content into different languages. Only a consent form is required.Contact nomoreransom@europol.europa.eu if you think you qualify! Meta Tags:   	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/NoMoreRansom2019.aspx

This tool has allowed so far more than 4 400 victims from 150 countries to recover their encrypted files, with several hundreds of thousands of other victims who could be helped.Already strong of 129 partners, No More Ransom was joined today by Bleeping Computer, Cisco and ESET as new associate partners, while Microsoft, Symantec, Coveware and Northwind Data Recovery joined in a supporting capacity. Cyprus, Estonia, Scotland and Sweden also joined over the course of the past year, bringing the number of involved law enforcement agencies to 41.So far, the tools provided on No More Ransom have managed to decrypt the infected computer of over 72 000 victims worldwide – yet there are still many more victims out there which need help, this even more so as the threat of ransomware is going nowhere in 2019.Join the fight against ransomwareAre you a cybersecurity company willing to join forces with law enforcement and industry leaders in the fight to disrupt ransomware?Do you have an innovative solution for ransomware families not covered yet in the portal to help victims recover their files without giving into the demands of the criminals?Then we want to hear from you!Better safe than sorryThe best cure against ransomware remains diligent prevention. Users are strongly advised to:Always keep a copy of their most important files somewhere else: in the cloud, on another drive, on a memory stick, or on another computer.Use reliable and up-to-date anti-virus software.Not download programs from suspicious sources.Not open attachments in e-mails from unknown senders, even if they look important and credible.And if you are a victim, don’t pay the ransom!Find more information and prevention tips on www.nomoreransom.org Meta Tags:   	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/NoMoreRansom2018.aspx

The non-legislative report was adopted by 514 votes to 107, with 38 abstentions.EU ministers should admit Bulgaria and Romania to the border check-free Schengen area as soon as possible, MEPs urge.A two-step approach - first ending checks at internal sea and air borders, followed by stopping checks at internal land borders - would pose a number of risks and could negatively impact the future enlargement of the Schengen area, say MEPs. The decision should therefore be taken in the form of a single legal act.Parliament also calls on EU Ministers to decide on Croatia’s Schengen accession as soon as Croatia has successfully met the required criteria.Read the full EP Press Release Meta Tags:   	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/Extending-the-Schengen-area.aspx

The final decision on crossing the external border lies with the destination Member State. ETIAS will carry out pre-travel screening to assess the security and migration risks of travellers who benefit from visa-free access to the Schengen area, and thus allow Member States to deny authorisation to travellers considered to pose a security threat, or a risk in terms of irregular migration or public health. In order to cross an external Schengen border, visa-free travellers will need to have both a valid travel document and an ETIAS authorisation.eu-LISA is responsible for the development and the technical management of the ETIAS Information System, whilst Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, will manage the ETIAS Central Unit.The ETIAS Information System foresees, among others: a centralised system to process the applications a national uniform interface in each Member State that connects the central system and the national infrastructures a secure communication infrastructure between the central system and the national uniform interfaces a public website and a mobile app for mobile devices an email service as well as a number of tools for applicants, such as an account service, a verification tool, and a tool to provide or withdraw consent for data retention beyond the general retention period. ETIAS is due to become operational by the end of 2021.

EULISA_NEWS_0152	2018-09-21	NEWS	eu-LISA Industry Roundtable – Technologies to Facilitate Land Border Crossing	 Page ContentOn 18th October, eu-LISA invites industry to participate in a roundtable event focussed on innovative ideas to ensure smooth and secure crossing of the EU's external green borders. In the coming years, the implementation of the Entry-Exit System (EES) and European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) will imply the introduction of new border crossing processes. At many borders, introduction of automated technologies such as e-gates and self-service kiosks will be possible to ensure facilitated travel, meaning that overall border crossing times may decrease despite the introduction of new requirements such as biometric enrolment and verification and the inclusion of additional database queries in the overall process. However, land borders present more significant challenges than most. Conclusion of future border checks for travellers in personal vehicles or travelling on buses and trains will surely require new technological solutions and perhaps reconfiguration of the overall process of checks. eu-LISA, as the authority responsible for the development and implementation of the EES and ETIAS and as chair of the EES Advisory Group, has taken note of requests from EU Member State experts to consider the challenges of future border checks at land borders and coordinate collaborative analysis on possible future solutions. The Agency would like to convene industry responsible for development of relevant technologies and/or providing general expertise to authorities in border management processes to brainstorm or contribute to this initial brainstorming event. Member State experts belonging to the working group established by the Agency will also attend to support discussions along with representatives of other relevant EU Agencies. The Agency requests interested parties to consider possible solutions that they would be in a position to discuss and to register their interest in participating by October 5th at the latest. We are particularly interested in demonstration of proposed technologies/prototypes that you may consider feasible based on your experience. Please note that we will not have the capacity for demonstration of large-scale physical infrastructure at the location, and therefore demonstration of such solutions through videos/slides is requested. Based on requirements identified by the working group and those known to the Agency and its partners through their work, the most promising proposals will be selected for presentation at the roundtable on the day. Please complete your registration at the following link, and, should you wish to present, submit a maximum one page summary of your proposed presentation to research@eulisa.europa.eu. Further logistical information will be made available to participants following their registration. In case of questions or further follow up, please do not hesitate to contact research@eulisa.europa.eu. › Event Agenda​.

They will need to obtain a travel authorisation before their trip, via an online application. For each application, the applicant will be required to pay a travel authorisation fee of 7 euros.The information submitted in each application will be automatically processed against EU and relevant Interpol databases to determine whether there are grounds to refuse a travel authorisation. If no hits or elements requiring further analysis are identified, the travel authorisation will be issued automatically and quickly. This is expected to be the case for most applications.Before boarding, air carriers and sea carriers will need to check whether third country nationals subject to the travel authorisation requirement are in possession of a valid travel authorisation.Next stepsThe Council and the European Parliament now need to sign the adopted regulation. The signed text will be published in the EU Official Journal and will enter into force 20 days later. eu-LISA, is expected to start building the new system, which should  be operational by 2021.Further reading:The full Press Release can be found on the European Council website as well as explanatory videos and infographics.

EULISA_NEWS_0158	2018-06-25	NEWS	EES Advisory Group comes together for their first meeting	" Page ContentThe newly formed Entry-Exit System Advisory Group (EES AG), part of eu-LISA's governance structure, will hold its first working meeting on 25 June in Tallinn. The Advisory Group convenes at a time when the Agency, having received the legal mandate for the establishment of an Entry-Exit System, has made all the preparations for the new system and will start regular working meetings with the new system's governing body.  The role of the EES AG is to provide, during the designing and development phase of EES, technical expertise to support the tasks of the EES Programme Management Board, follow-up and coordinate all related activities both centrally and at national level, as well as provide support with various technical issues related to developing the system. The EES AG will also follow-up and coordinate all activities related to adapting VIS and BMS for EES purposes and will provide the Agency's Management Board with expert technical advice. The EES Advisory Group will be composed of national EES project managers, Europol's included, and chaired by eu-LISA.The first meeting will bring together all relevant project teams to go through various topics, amongst which the current state of play and a plan for the next steps.The Executive Director of eu-LISA, Krum Garkov, explained the importance of the Advisory Group: ""The Entry-Exit System Advisory Group has been setup by eu-LISA and it is an important step towards the implementation of EES. The group will be instrumental in supporting the tasks of the EES Programme Management Board. Its primary tasks will be to coordinate the work of the Agency and the Members States in their efforts to implement EES in the EU and to serve as a focal point to address technical and operational matters related to the implementation and use of EES. In short, the EES advisory Group gathers expert parties around the same table in order to support successful implementation of the latest EU information system, entrusted to eu-LISA by our legislators.""Theofanis Syrigos, the Chairman of EES Advisory Group, added: ""The Schengen Area allows people to travel without internal border controls; the increasing numbers of people travelling to the Union requires efficient management of the Union's common external borders to ensure strong protection. EES is a new central register that will address the effective access management to the EU and will be essential to efficient cross-border movement. eu-LISA, in close cooperation with Member States, will build up the new system and will extend the existing Visa Information System and the Biometric Matching System in line with the legal provisions, for the benefit of all EU citizens. Therefore the coordination amongst all involved stakeholders is extremely important."" Background The Entry Exit System, the development of which is entrusted to eu-LISA, addresses an important gap in the landscape of existing EU information systems and will replace, amongst others, the current practice of manual stamping of passports. It will do this by electronically registering, in a central database, biographic and biometric information, the date and place of entry and exit of the third country nationals, visiting the Schengen area for a short stay. The system will modernise and increase automation at border-controls as well as improve reliable identification of over-stayers, whilst strengthening internal security and fighting terrorism and organised crime.

EULISA_NEWS_0163	2018-06-12	NEWS	Major funding increase for stronger borders and migration proposed	" Page ContentFor the next long-term EU budget 2021-2027, the European Commission proposes to almost triple funding for migration and border management to €34.9 billion, as compared to €13 billion in the previous period.The Commission's proposal is a response to increased migratory, mobility and security challenges, with more flexible funding instruments to address unforeseen migratory events and border protection at the core of the new budget. A new separate fund for integrated border management will be created and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency will be further strengthened with a new standing corps of around 10,000 border guards. The new border fund will also help Member States carry out customs controls by financing customs control equipment.First Vice-President Frans Timmermans said: ""Based on past experience and the knowledge that migration will remain a challenge in the future, we are proposing an unprecedented increase in funding. Strengthening our common EU borders, in particular with our European Border and Coast Guard, will continue to be a big priority. Increased flexibility of our funding instruments means we are ready to support Member States quickly; where they need it, when they need it – particularly in the event of crisis.""Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, Dimitris Avramopoulos said: ""Better managing our external borders and migration will remain key priorities for the EU, the Member States and our citizens in the years to come. Bigger challenges need bigger resources – this is why we propose to almost triple the budget in this area. The reinforced funding will be pivotal in ensuring that we can implement these political priorities: further secure our external borders, continue to grant protection to those who need it, better support legal migration and integration efforts, counter irregular migration, and effectively and swiftly return those who have no right to stay.""The effective protection of the EU's external borders is crucial to manage migration and ensure internal security. Strong external borders are also what allow the EU to maintain a Schengen area without internal border controls. The Commission proposes to allocate €21.3 billion to border management overall and create a new Integrated Border Management Fund (IBMF) worth more than €9.3 billion.The full press release including details about the IBMF, next steps and background readings can be found here: http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4106_en.htm Meta Tags:   "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/Major-funding-increase-for-stronger-borders-and-migration.aspx

Consulted over 5 billion times by national authorities in 2017, the reinforced SIS will help border guards to better monitor who is crossing the EU's borders; support police and law enforcement in capturing dangerous criminals and terrorists; and offer greater protection for missing children and vulnerable adults, in line with the new data protection rules.Welcoming the agreement Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Dimitris Avramopoulos, said: “The Schengen Information System is a vital instrument for enhancing our internal security and strengthening the management of the EU's external borders. The system lies at the heart of Schengen. With the new obligatory alerts for terrorist suspects, new alerts on return decisions and stronger interoperability with other systems for security, borders and migration management, it will help preserve free movement and the very essence of Schengen for our citizens, knowing that their Union is protecting them.""Commissioner for the Security Union Julian King said: “A strengthened SIS will provide police and border guards with the information they need to do their jobs and help keep Europeans safe. It is the centrepiece of information exchange in Europe and the main law enforcement database in the EU, and has contributed to almost 40,000 arrests and 200,000 serious criminals being tracked down. We have been making the SIS stronger and smarter – for example with the launch of the Automated Fingerprint Identification System earlier this year – and it will in future be a key pillar underpinning the interoperability of the EU's information systems.”The full Statement from the European Commission including details on the foreseen improvements to SIS, the next steps and background information can be read here: http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-18-4133_en.htm Meta Tags: regulation; SIS II "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/Commission-welcomes-agreement-on-a-reinforced-Schengen-Information-System.aspx

EULISA_NEWS_0181	2018-02-23	NEWS	Happy 100th anniversary to the Republic of Estonia!	 Page Content On 24 February 2018, one hundred years will have passed since the proclamation of Estonia as an independent, democratic republic. This is undoubtedly one of the most important and greatest milestones in the history of Estonia. eu-LISA’s head office has been in Tallinn, Estonia since the Agency started working back in 2012 and is proud to be part of the contemporary history of this country.”Estonia is an example of the great success amongst the nations of Europe. The story of Estonia is a story of constant self-creation. This country has built a vibrant democracy and new prosperity, and has become a model for the rest of Europe of how citizens can interact with their government in the 21st century” said Krum Garkov, Executive Director of eu-LISA.  Estonia 100 is a celebration for everyone – regardless of ethnic origin, native language, creed or how long they have been living in the country – everyone is welcome to join in the festivities. All Estonians abroad and friends of Estonia throughout the world are also invited to take part in the centenary programme.Background:The Republic of Estonia was born hundred years ago, on February 24th, 1918. From the next day, the new country was in turmoil. A brief occupation by German forces was followed by an attack from Soviet Russia and the Estonian War of Independence. The war ended and a ceasefire started on January 3rd, 1920.Regardless political tensions, Estonia grew, local society developed and cultural life flourished for the next 20 years. In the course of World War II Estonia became occupied by Soviet forces in 1940 and by Germany in 1941 and then again by the Soviet Union in 1944.The Estonian government continued its work in exile from 1944 until 1992 and the acting Prime Minister was also the acting head of Estonian state. The Estonian government in exile was internationally recognized.This way the Estonian government in exile carried the legal continuity of the Estonian state. In October 1992 Heinrich Mark, the last Prime Minister who acted as the head of state, handed over his credentials to Lennart Meri. Lennart Meri became the President of Estonia and the continuity of the Republic of Estonia was guaranteed.  Be a part of the celebration: local programme, international programme More info here: https://www.ev100.ee/en Meta Tags: Estonia; Anniversary 	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/Happy-100th-anniversary-to-the-Republic-of-Estonia.aspx
EULISA_NEWS_0182	2018-03-06	NEWS	eu-LISA Industry Roundtable 16 May 2018 – Save the date!	" Page Contenteu-LISA, the European Agency for Operational Management of Large-scale IT systems in the area of Freedom, Security and Justice, will host an Industry Roundtable entitled ""EU external borders – streamlining of information exchange"" in Sofia, Bulgaria on May 16th 2018. The event is intended to convene representatives of entities involved in the carriage of travellers to and from the EU by air, sea and/or land, industry involved in the development and implementation of tools for advance passenger checks, academia who may have a strong research interest in such topics and EU Agencies/Institutions involved in relevant operational activities and policy discussions. The roundtable will focus on two new large-scale IT systems to be launched in the area of freedom, security and justice, namely the Entry/Exit System (EES) and the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), and the use of API/PNR data in the context of carrier queries against these systems. Generally, possible centralised approaches to exchange of such data will be considered. It is foreseen that industry, international organisations and/or national authorities provide presentations on methods and tools for carriers to conduct foreseen mandatory checks against these systems. Discussions will aim towards identification of optimal approaches for data submission and possible synergies while taking full account of modern carrier processes and the roles of technology therein. Means to ensure provision of high quality data by carriers will also be examined.   The roundtable will provide an opportunity for carriers to express their views on how mandatory checks will impact their work and how such checks can be incorporated into their processes so as to minimise any negative impacts. It will also be a forum for bringing together the various entities who will be involved in work on relevant solutions in the coming years, providing a foundation for further discussions and collaboration between eu-LISA and other relevant parties. Industry will have the chance to indicate how their technologies and developments might help to increase efficiencies in the future.Carrier organisations and industry are invited to show their interest in attending by e-mailing externalaffairs@eulisa.europa.eu by 13th April 2018. Please note that participation is limited to two persons per company/entity. Those with an interest in providing presentations are especially invited to say so in their message. Both strategic presentations on foreseen future setups for carrier-system interactions and practical presentations of possible tools/solutions will be welcomed. The roundtable will be held in cooperation with the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and will be followed by a conference on border security organised by the Presidency on the next day.Follow our website for updates regarding speakers, participation and registration.

EULISA_NEWS_0183	2018-03-06	NEWS	eu-LISA successfully launches SIS II AFIS Phase One	" Page ContentAfter a little less than two years of intense efforts, the eu-LISA Internal Security Systems Sector successfully launched the first phase of the SIS II AFIS platform. The platform enables the identification of a person from his/her fingerprints alone.  The introduction of a biometric search capability in SIS II was achieved by eu-LISA in tight cooperation with ten Member States who showed both interest and willingness to use biometric queries once deployed at the Central System level. Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia will soon be followed by more Member States.The aim of SIS II AFIS is to allow all the Member States to leverage on a centralized policing-oriented database. As such, it will strengthen the fight against crime within Europe which is a mission we should bear in mind each day. Using the platform to locate those who either lie about their identity or changed it to avoid detection is paramount to Europe's security.SIS II AFIS Phase One entered into operation on 5 March 2018 at 22:00 CET. The entire project was performed without any deviation from the timescale and in full compatibility with the requests from eu-LISA's Governing Bodies.""This is an important milestone in the evolution of SIS II. With its new biometric search capabilities the system becomes an even more important platform for law-enforcement cooperation and information exchange. At the same time, this is a great achievement for the Agency as a whole, demonstrating again our agility and ability to deliver towards the needs of eu-LISA's stakeholders."" said Krum Garkov, Executive Director of eu-LISA.BackgroundArticles 22 (c) of the SIS II Decision and the SIS II Regulation have foreseen an evolution towards the normal law enforcement practice of comparing a person's fingerprints to the many sets of prints stored in SIS II ('one-to-many' search) to identify the person solely on the basis of his/her fingerprints.However, this can only be achieved by using an Automatic Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS).LinksSISII RegulationSISII DecisionSIS II Technical ReportContactsfor media requests:e-mail: press@eulisa.europa.eufor general information:e-mail: info@eulisa.europa.eu Meta Tags: SIS II; Cooperation; Member States; AFIS "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/eu-LISA-successfully-launches-SIS-II-AFIS-Phase-One.aspx
EULISA_NEWS_0184	2018-03-02	NEWS	AFIS for SIS II to be deployed this month	" Page Content The Schengen Information System (SIS II) is a highly efficient large-scale information system that supports law enforcement cooperation and external border control throughout the Member States of the European Union (and Schengen Associated Countries).The SIS II enables competent authorities, for example police officers and border guards, to enter and consult alerts on specific categories of wanted or missing persons and objects.SIS II acts as an information sharing system between all the countries that use it and holds information in the form of ""alerts"". Each Person alert can contain biographical information such as, name, date of birth, gender and nationality. In addition to this, SIS II can also store fingerprints and photographs of the person an alert is related to. Although the legal basis of SIS II permits the storage of fingerprints, they have only been used so far to confirm the identity of a person who has been identified following a check on his/her name and/or date of birth. Though this feature has been useful, the real added value of fingerprints is to be able to identify a person from his/her fingerprints alone. In order for this to occur, an Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) is necessary and is now ready to go live. How is an AFIS used?Many people, sought after by the police, can be evasive about their identity and tend to use multiple aliases. Some subjects of SIS II alerts for ""refusal of entry"" have even sought to legally change their identity to avoid detection. AFIS provides the technology to identify a person on the basis of fingerprints held in SIS II. What is the purpose?The SIS II central system database already contains many thousands of fingerprint records, but there was no fingerprint search capability at the central level. The SIS II AFIS allows all Member States to leverage on a centralized policing-oriented database. As such, it will strengthen the fight against crime within Europe. Who is part of the AFIS Project?The Project Management Forum (PMF) is responsible for managing technical implementation at both national and central system levels. Its members are:The eu-LISA AFIS team,National Project Managers of all the SIS II Member States,Representatives of the European Commission,SIS II contractor – responsible for the design and delivery of the AFIS to eu-LISA.The first PMF meeting took place in June 2016, followed by 15 further regular meetings, that gathered the end-users from the Member States and Associated Countries. Training sessions for the Member States has already been delivered in Strasbourg and via web-based seminars. When will it be implemented?The Phase 1 Go-live will take place on 5 March 2018. It will introduce the biometric search capability into SIS II. Ten Member States (AT, CH, DE, LI, LU, LV, NL, PL, PT & SI) have confirmed that they will be ready to use the biometric queries from day 1. Within 2018, it is expected that other Member States will also use this functionality offered by the Central System.Further work will take place to develop the AFIS' capabilities in Phase 2 which will be implemented in 2019.

EULISA_NEWS_0187	2018-01-29	NEWS	Data Protection Day 2018	 Page Content On January 28th the EU and the Council of Europe celebrated the European Data Protection Day. On the same day, back in 1981, the Convention 108 – Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data – was signed. It is for this very reason that the Council of Europe launched in 2016 a Data Protection Day to be celebrated each year on 28 January.Data Protection Day is now celebrated across the globe and is called Privacy Day outside of Europe. In 2009, the United States Congress passed a resolution declaring January 28 as Data Privacy Day. The Convention 108, is the first binding international instrument to protect an individual against abuses of the processing of their personal information. Moreover, it also imposes some restrictions on transborder flows of personal data to countries where legal regulation does not provide equivalent protection. At present the Convention has 51 ratifications.The right to the protection of personal data, is a fundamental right laid down in Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental rights and in article 16 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the EU. The right to the protection of personal data may be considered as one of the most important human rights of the modern age. In fact, topics such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Machine and Deep learning, Internet of Things, Ubiquitous Computing, Surveillance and Data Transfer are examples that demonstrate the need for a right like this. This right also preserves the dignity and self-determination of an individual.  On this date, governments, parliaments, national data protection bodies and other bodies perform activities to raise awareness about the right to personal data protection and privacy. In the course of our activities at eu-LISA, we process personal data. Thus, one of our jobs is keeping data secure.  It is immeasurably important for the Agency to be compliant with the provisions of Regulation (EC) N° 45/2001 as well as other legal instruments in the area of the protection of personal data.

Today's vote reflects the political commitment of the European Parliament to swiftly deliver on this priority file. It is an important step towards achieving more effective border management and better oversight of who is crossing the EU's external borders – and the Commission warmly welcomes this decision.As President Juncker recalled in his Letter of Intent accompanying his State of the Union Address of 13 September, the Entry/Exit System is a priority initiative which will modernise the management of the EU external border and contribute to the fight against terrorism and serious crime. It will replace the stamping of passports and will allow for an increased automation of border controls, improved detection of document and identity fraud as well as better monitoring of unauthorised short stays of non-EU nationals.The Entry/Exit System will also close an important information gap and will contribute to achieving full interoperability of EU information systems by 2020, in full respect of fundamental rights and data protection rules. Following the introduction of systematic checks on all travellers crossing the external border and with the new European Border and Coast Guard Agency being fully operational, the Entry/Exit System represents further concrete action towards making our borders even stronger, smarter and more secure. The Commission is now looking forward to the Council continuing to deliver on this political priority, so that the system can be up and running by 2020 at the latest.""Further details can be found here:European Commission Press Release Database Meta Tags: EES "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/Commission-welcomes-adoption-of-EES.aspx

Croatia will now be able to exchange information with other Member States through SIS on persons wanted in relation to terrorism and other serious crimes, missing persons and certain objects such as stolen vehicles, firearms and identity documents. This will further enhance information exchange between Member States and will contribute to the security of all European citizens. Croatia's integration into SIS will also help reduce waiting time at land borders between Croatia and Slovenia - with both Member States having access to SIS II, there will no longer be a need for checks against databases on both sides of the border.The Commission had proposed the gradual integration of Croatia into the SIS on 18 January 2017, with the Council adopting the Commission proposal on 25 April 2017 and setting the date for the entry into operation for 27 June 2017. In December 2016, the Commission presented a legislative proposal to further strengthen the operational effectiveness of the Schengen Information System by improving the security and accessibility of the system and including new alert categories as well as the obligation for Member States to create SIS alerts in cases related to terrorist offences.The addition of Croatia now brings the total number of Members States and Associated Countries that use SIS to 30. Further to these EU Agencies Europol and Eurojust also have access to the system. The second generation of the Schengen Information System (SIS II) is one of the large-scale IT systems that have been entrusted to eu-LISA.Further readings: SIS II Information LeafletSource:  http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEX-17-1805_en.htm Meta Tags: Member States; SIS II 	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/Croatia-becomes-part-of-SIS.aspx

Twice a year the Data Protection Officers (DPO) from European Union Institutions, Bodies and Agencies meet in order to discuss and brainstorm on data protection related matters and reinforce collaboration efforts. For the first time, in light of the preparations for the new privacy rules, a member of the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) and two members of the DAPIX Working Party took part in the conference. Soon the European Union data protection framework will change and be aligned with the newly adopted General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the future ePrivacy Regulation. This modification will ensure that European Union Institutions, Bodies and Agencies will also offer a high standard of protection while they process personal data. In this regard eu-LISA, as operational manager of European Union large-scale IT systems, is dedicated to comply with the data protection rules respecting the fundamental rights of privacy and data protection of data subjects. This point is currently of utmost importance since eu-LISA’s mandate will soon be extended to cover news IT systems. The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) was very satisfied of the discussions since key topics such as the role of the DPO within organisation, Data Breach, Accountability, Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and Privacy by Design and by Default were tabled and tackled during the meeting. All the DPOs took this opportunity to exchange views, raise concerns and learn from each other in order to gather useful knowledge for upcoming data protection challenges. The blogpost on this topic, penned by Wojciech Wiewiórowski, Assistant Supervisor at the EDPS, is available here. eu-LISA’s Data Protection Office, and eu-LISA as a whole, are very pleased with the outcome of this event. Praises on both the content and organisation of the meeting came from all participants.The next DPO meeting will be hosted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in London.

The need for swift and secure data sharing has become highly important to fight the ever more complex transnational security threats. Thus, the ability of IT systems to ""speak to each other"", being the priority for the Commission, was addressed also at the board meeting. Commissioner King emphasised that ""/…/ eu-LISA is a crucial actor in the technical work to achieve this (interoperability) /…/ guided by the new approach to the management of data for borders and security/…/"".The Commissioner acknowledged that for interoperability to work eu-LISA needs to be strengthened via the revised mandate enabling the Agency to implement the new approach.Krum Garkov assured the Commissioner and the board that providing high-quality and efficient services and solutions to its stakeholders will remain the key priority to eu-LISA also under the revised mandate. The role of the Management Board stays highly important to guide the Agency in line with the expectations of the Member States and make the best use of the technical capabilities available in eu-LISA.  Background:List of members of the Management Board Commissioner King's statement to the Management Board meeting of eu-LISA in Strasbourgeu-LISA leafletContacts:e-mail: press@eulisa.europa.eufor general information: info@eulisa.europa.eu Meta Tags: interoperability; Management Board; Strasbourg "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/eu-LISA-welcomes-its-Management-Board-in-Strasbourg.aspx

EULISA_NEWS_0220	2017-03-22	NEWS	60th Anniversary of the Treaties of Rome	 Page Content 2017 marks the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome, widely regarded as the foundation stone of the movement towards greater political and economic union that has become known as the ‘European project.’ Signed on 25 March 1957, the treaties established the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). While their immediate objectives were to integrate trade and strengthen the economies of the area, one of its underlying political desires was to ‘lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the people of Europe’.Sixty years later we can witness how modern information and communication technologies have affected EU societies and created additional frameworks to foster links within this ‘ever closer union among the people’.  Today information and communication technologies are one of the EU’s driving forces for the digital transformation of public services. We are now moving towards a newer and faster generation of smart technical solutions which can transform people’s lives, industry and the overall outlook of the EU.  ICT is the modern tool to provide people with services that are based on innovative solutions and aim to protect the values that we have cherished for the past 60 years: freedom, justice and security. In eu-LISA, the European Agency for the management of large-scale IT systems in the area of justice, freedom and security, we believe that the keywords for the EU of the generations to come are:  innovation and digitalization. They are the backbone of the present and the future union where policy-makers, regulators and industry work closely together for the benefit of the people.  This is not an easy glide upwards only. From the past and present of the EU we know that challenges and setbacks are an inevitable part of progress. However, we also know that as long as we embrace our common values, working smart and making the best use of new technologies will continue to lead us to growth and prosperity. Let us think today about the EU success-stories of the past 60 years and celebrate the achievements of the ‘European project’! Happy Anniversary! Krum GarkovExecutive DirectorRead more about Digital Day here: http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_AGENDA-17-522_en.htm Meta Tags: European Institutions; Anniversary 	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/60-EU-Rome.aspx

EULISA_NEWS_0240	2016-05-09	NEWS	eu-LISA industry workshop - Call for Registration	" Page Content eu-LISA will organise a workshop entitled ""Increasing the Efficiency of Hotspots: Handling Migratory Pressure through Practical Technological Solutions"" on June 14th 2016 in Strasbourg, France. In the European Agenda on Migration presented in May 2015, the European Commission introduced the so-called hotspots approach. The approach was designed to provide immediate necessary support to Member States who faced disproportionate pressures at the EU's external borders during the migratory crisis and entailed the coordinated collaboration of the Member States' authorities with EU Agencies on the ground. eu-LISA experts worked with colleagues from Frontex, EASO, Europol and Eurojust at the hotspot in Lesbos, Greece, in late 2015, providing technological assistance on topics in which they had specialised knowledge, in particular related to the recording of data in Eurodac and the overall use of the system. The joint endeavours of the EU Agencies and the Greek authorities, during the first stage of this project, resulted in an increase in the capacity of those working on the ground to deal with the influx of individuals needing to be enrolled into Eurodac, leading to both an easing of the backlogs in processing and an improvement in humanitarian conditions.In the course of the work eu-LISA and its partners identified a number of areas in which processes could be made more efficient and effective. In particular, it was clear that more modern technological solutions could better support some of the ongoing processes. Considering lessons learned and given that migratory patterns change over time, the Agencies are also currently assessing how technologies could be better developed so as to be more helpful as demands and needs change. In order to advance this work, supported by knowledge and understanding of the state-of-the-art in developments in IT that could increase the efficiency of migration management, eu-LISA would like to convene relevant vendors working in this field for an industry workshop. As a centre of expertise in the field, eu-LISA will also utilise this opportunity to open the forum to other relevant participants, particularly its partner Agencies.The agenda of the workshop can be accessed here. Organisation and contextThe workshop ""Increasing the Efficiency of Hotspots: Handling Migratory Pressure through Practical Technological Solutions"" will be held on June 14th from 9.00 to 15.00 in Hotel Sofitel, Strasbourg, France. The event will provide an opportunity for industry to update on and discuss current or near-future solutions pertaining to the current border and migration challenges in Europe. Discussions will be open to all attendees and no bilateral meetings will be organised.  The aim is to assemble and share thoughts; under no circumstances should the event be considered as a prelude or an advantage to eventual procurement exercises. FormatThe event will open with keynote presentations from EU Agencies who will introduce the various challenges that have been identified in recent work and that need to be overcome. Subsequently, vendors will have the opportunity to propose and discuss possible means to address the noted challenges through individual presentations and group discussions. Participation and LogisticsIn view of the above eu-LISA would like to call on all vendors with expertise of likely relevance to express their interest in attending the event. Attendees may have the opportunity to present their work and should indicate a willingness to do so in their registration request. eu-LISA will select presenters from those submitted based on the relevance of the topics proposed and the expertise of the proposing companies. Capacity is limited and eu-LISA reserves the right to select attendees based on their areas of expertise and knowledge and their likely relevance to the proposed discussions. The Agency will not be in a position to cover any costs associated with attendance at the event. Please express your interest to eu-LISA by 09 June 2016 by completing the online registration form.

EULISA_NEWS_0241	2016-04-15	NEWS	Eurodac storage capacity increased	 Page Content​Earlier this month, on the 5th of April, a new Eurodac release was successfully deployed increasing the storage capacity of the system to 5.5 Million records. This deployment was the first step in the implementation of a planned upgrade to 7 Million records that will take place over the coming months. This latest roll-out forms part of a series of upgrades that started late in 2015 intended to appropriately size the Eurodac system in order to cope with the huge data traffic increase that stems from the ongoing migration influx towards Europe.What is Eurodac? Eurodac is the European Dactyloscopy (fingerprints) database. It facilitates the application of the Dublin Regulation by helping to determine the country responsible for the assessment of an asylum claim presented in the European Union or the Associated Dublin States (Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein). The system is used in 32 countries: 28 EU Member States and 4 Associated Dublin States. Since 20 July 2015, Eurodac Recast Regulation No 603/2013 took effect and national police forces as well as Europol can have access to the system subject to strict conditions, for the purpose of prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences as well as other serious criminal offences.

EULISA_NEWS_0253	2015-12-16	NEWS	VIS has processed 20,000,000 visa applications	 Page Content Following the successful roll-out of the Visa Information System (VIS) at consular posts worldwide, it gives eu-LISA great pleasure to inform you that VIS has processed its 20,000,000th visa application. This represents around 1,0Bn€ in non-fiscal revenues for Member States since its entry into operations on the 11th of October 2011. Following the provisions of the Commission’s Implementing Decision 2015/731, Member States hav started using VIS globally and only this year VIS will have efficiently processed close to 9.5Mi applications. This solely has brought in around 500Mi€ for Member States, not accounting for the additional touristic revenues drawn from those who travelled to Europe. The Central System is consistently performing very well, subsequent to the completion of the full VIS roll-out schedule to the consular authorities. eu-LISA is continuously enhancing the performance of the system by upgrading the current VIS storage-processing capacity and increasing its processing times to better support the business and particularly border related activities of Member States. By Q2 2016 the system processing capability will be upgraded towards an intermediate step of 60Mi applications. In the next couple of years the VIS storage-processing capacity will be further increased to a target estimated between 80Mi and 120Mi visa applications, in line with data protection and retention rules. The plan for roll-out in the region ‘external borders’ is under further discussions, with the roll-out to this last region enabling border guards to issue biometric visas. In addition, VIS Mail phase 2 will soon enter into operations and replace the VISION mechanism. From that moment onwards, Member States will globally use VIS Mail for the Schengen consultation processes. The Agency is thus very pleased to inform all stakeholders of the smooth operations of the Visa Information System globally.

EULISA_NEWS_0272	2015-08-06	NEWS	Smart Borders Pilot interim report presented by eu-LISA	 Page ContentAn interim report on the preliminary technical observations of eu-LISA's Smart Borders Pilot​ has been provided to the European Commission and co-legislators. The report reflects important mid-term findings which provide initial insight into the feasibility of concepts that use biometric data at both automated and manual border controls.To assess how the different technologies are perceived, feedback was collected from both border guards and participating travellers. When asked about the use of biometric identifiers such as fingerprints and facial recognition, 80% of border guards were more confident than before about the added value of the new equipment while 82% found the proposed technology user friendly.Travellers were also surveyed to see how satisfied they felt with the new concepts. The report found that travellers were 'very satisfied/satisfied' across all types of borders – air (92%), land (87%) and sea (88%). eu-LISA will continue to test innovative technologies for future border checks as part of the operational phase of the Smart Borders Pilot which started in February 2015 and ends in September 2015. Test locations are spread across the EU in Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden. A more detailed analysis on Smart Borders will then be presented in the final report when it is delivered on 30 November 2015.

Therefore, people who wanted to get eu-LISA gadgets, had to solve special quizzes on the Agency. By the end of the day hundreds of people had spent quite some time reading the eu-LISA information materials to solve the not too easy questions of the quizzes and were visibly happy to receive the prizes with eu-LISA logo.  According to official records around 14 000 visitors attended the Europe Day activities and 4000 participated at the Passport Game.  eu-LISA was one of the mandatory check-points for the very popular Passport Game, meaning that the eu-LISA ""stamp"" had to be issued in the passports that were produced for the Europe Day travel game and that were later used to win prizes. Consequently, we made at least 4000 direct contacts in addition to the several hundreds who participated directly in the eu-LISA  quizzes or came just to discuss the future of Europe and the role that eu-LISA has in serving Member States and the citizens.  352 selfies were uploaded to the special Greeting Card of the 2015 Europe Day sent to Europe.

First they managed the meetings of the Advisory Groups and subsequently welcomed several visiting groups from European academia and schools.On 01 June a group of 15 students from the Berlin School of Economics & Law and their professor visited eu-LISA within the framework of a Police Management Course. A delegation of 21 PhD students and professors from the Romanian Police Academy came to the Agency on 05 June under the Operational Programme for Human Resource Development. The research interest of the bachelor and post-graduate students focused around topics related to public order and national safety. eu-LISA staff members explained the role of the Agency in safeguarding the European Union's internal security and the functioning of the three large-scale IT systems which are used in law enforcement and border management. The debate focused around the impact of the use of advanced biometric systems and sophisticated information and communication technology to implement the Union's policies in the area of justice, security and freedom.   More general discussions about the Agency and its daily activities took place with a group of 40 pupils and teachers from the European Schools in  Tallinn, Helsinki, Parma, Strasbourg and Heraklion, visiting Estonia as part of an Erasmus Plus project. The aim of the project is to allow 11-14 year old pupils to learn about different EU countries and the EU Agencies they host, as without such agencies there would hardly be the system of European Schools as it exists today. Many eu-LISA staff members are directly involved in the life of the European School in Tallinn and thus it was easy to find a ""common language"" with the pupils and their teachers to explain the impact of eu-LISA on everyday life of European citizens. Contact:info@eulisa.europa.eu Meta Tags: Awareness raising; Students; Training "	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/A-week-for-teaching-and-learning-about-eu-LISA.aspx

Subsequently, from 13 April 2015 the UK shall enter data into SIS II and use SIS II data. The Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) provides law enforcement alerts on wanted criminals, suspected terrorists, missing people, and stolen or missing property. The IT system is already used by 28 European countries. Since April 2013, UK has worked closely with eu-LISA to achieve technical readiness for the accession to SIS II. The support extended by eu-LISA to the UK authorities comprised testing, training of national staff and setting up the workflow for the exchange of information.The SIS II provides for sharing of 'alerts' on five main categories of persons or objects: persons wanted for arrest for surrender or extradition purposes (mainly linked to the European Arrest Warrant); missing persons; persons sought to assist with a judicial procedure; persons and objects subject to discreet or specific checks (i.e. police surveillance); and objects for seizure or use as evidence in criminal proceedings. SISII is a highly targeted IT system, focussing only on those individuals involved in the criminal law process, or police surveillance, or banned from entry from the EU's territory. SIS II does not provide for a basis for sharing criminal records or various other categories of criminal law data. The system provides real-time alerts to speed up the exchange of information. eu-LISA is responsible for running the SIS II Central System and keeping it operational 24/7, allowing national authorities to constantly exchange and share information. eu-LISA is also responsible for implementing security measures, training on the technical use of the system, producing related statistics and reports as well as monitoring relevant research. ​ Meta Tags: SIS II; Stakeholder; Member States 	https://www.eulisa.europa.eu/Newsroom/News/Pages/Accession-of-UK-to-SIS-II-approved.aspx
