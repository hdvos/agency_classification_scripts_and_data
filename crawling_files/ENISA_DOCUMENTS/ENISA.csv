ENISA_NEWS_0002	2021-10-18	NEWS	EU National Telecom Authorities analyse Security Supervision and Latest Security Threats	 Launched more than 10 years ago, the European Competent Authorities for Secure Electronic Communications (ECASEC) group serves as a platform for collaboration and exchange of information among the national authorities supervising telecom security in Europe. The ECASEC group also develops and endorses guidelines for telecom security authorities on how to implement different aspects of EU telecom security policy. Besides the ECASEC meeting, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) hosted the 1st edition of the ENISA Telecom Security Forum on 13 October. The goal of this event, held in a hybrid format, was to bring together experts from both national authorities and the private sector to exchange views and discuss cybersecurity challenges and good practices. Highlights of the 35th ECASEC Expert Group meeting A total of more than 50 experts from national authorities supervising the European telecom sector in the EU, EFTA, EEA, and EU candidate countries attended the meeting held on 14th October, with almost a third of them being present physically. The meeting was the opportunity for the experts to follow an analysis of the supply chain threat landscape recently published by ENISA. BEREC also presented their report on the location of the Network Termination Points. The location of the Network Termination Points has an impact on whether an equipment is part of the public network or part of the telecommunications terminal equipment (TTE) and that distinction affects in turn the legal power of the National Regulatory Agencies (NRAs). ENISA introduced the main points of the upcoming ENISA reports on Consumer Outreach and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) Security and participants listened to an analysis of Confidentiality, Integrity and Authenticity attacks in public electronic communication networks. This type of attacks is of great interest for the members of the ECASEC Expert Group since the definition of security in the EECC includes also confidentiality of communications. Finally, the group dived into the recent Facebook outage and stressed the need for streamlining the incident reporting process so as to avoid unclear and overlapping obligations on providers and effectively cover cross-border incidents that involve several countries. The 1st edition of the ENISA telecom security forum in a nutshell A total of more than 250 telecom security experts met both physically in Athens and online to discuss the following points of the agenda: latest developments on the Electronic Communications Framework and other legislative initiatives at both European and national levels; good practices and experience in dealing with emerging security threats; emerging technologies and related initiatives. The Forum was opened by Evangelos Ouzounis, Head of the Policy Development and Implementation Unit of ENISA and by Warna Muzenbrock, chair of the ECASEC group. They both highlighted the challenges and opportunities of the new regulatory environment for the telecom sector. On behalf of the Greek mobile operators, George Stefanopoulos welcomed the participants and highlighted the challenges for operators during the pandemic and in view of the 5G rollout. The forum had three parts: a policy session about EU legislation, a technical session about ongoing cyber threats and a future networks session, with talks including topics such as 5G and edge computing. The Policy session: The Forum focused on the latest policy developments, the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) and the updated NIS Directive (NIS2) and how these affect the European telecom operators. The policy session started with an intervention from the European Commission presenting the NIS2 proposal and its implications for the telecom sector. Magnus Falk from ZOOM and Paolo Grassia from the European Telecommunications Network Association analysed the impact of the new legislation on telecom providers, both Number-Independent Interpersonal Communication Services providers and traditional ones. Finally, Kinga Pawlowska from a Polish media law firm discussed recent legislative proposals in Poland addressing the EECC and the NIS Directive. The Analysis of current threats and attacks – Technical session: The technical session of the Forum included a presentation of the sub-sea fibre network of Liberty Global and an analysis of SIM Swapping attacks by Europol. Additionally, the Centre for Cybersecurity of Denmark shared their work on the threat from ransomware for the telecoms sector. Kevin Meynell, from the Internet Society, explained the MANRS project, an industry collaboration that aims to set good practices for more secure Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing.  The future networks session: Julie Ruff, Deputy Head of Unit of Cybersecurity Technologies and Capacity building of European Commission DG CNECT, introduced the work of the 5G cybersecurity work stream of the NIS Cooperation Group. Silke Holtmanns, from Adaptive Mobile Security, member of the ENISA Advisory Group, presented an analysis of the Secure Integration of 5G Private Networks. The discussions focused on threat vectors seen in Multi Edge Computing (MEC) deployments and the security controls deployed by service providers. GSMA presented its Network Equipment Security Assurance Scheme (NESAS). The presentations given by the experts during the forum are available here: ENISA Telecom Security Forum - Agenda NIS Cooperation Group Work Stream 10 and joint meeting with the ECASEC Expert Group ENISA hosted the NIS Cooperation Group Work Stream 10, the group of EU national authorities supervising the security of the digital infrastructure under the NIS Directive, the day before the Telecom Security Forum.  On the day of the Forum, the members of ECASEC Expert Group and of WS10 had a joint meeting to discuss about common threats, challenges and possible synergies. Background on ECASEC Expert Group, formerly known as the ENISA Article 13a group Established in 2010, the ENISA ECASEC expert group, formerly known as ENISA Article 13a group, consists of about 100 experts from national telecom security authorities from all EU countries, the EFTA countries, and EU candidate countries. The group is a forum for exchanging information and good practices on telecom security. It produces policy guidelines for European authorities on the implementation of EU telecom security rules and publishes an annual summary report about major telecom security incidents. This work is done under the ENISA's Annual work programme Output 2.3 “Recommendations, technical guidelines and other activities to assist and support the implementation of the policies within NISD sectors, in the area of trust services and electronic identity, under the EECC and its implementing acts, in the field of privacy and data protection (especially Privacy by Design, Privacy Enhancing Technologies and security of personal data processing building on the work of previous years) and artificial intelligence (building on ENISA’s AI Threat Landscape)”.

ENISA_PR_0004	2021-10-12	PR	Blue OLEx 2021 : Testing the  Response to Large Cyber Incidents	 The Blue OLEx exercise of 12th October was designed to test the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) of the EU CyCLONe at executive level in case of a large-scale cross-border cyber crisis or incident affecting EU citizens and businesses. Organised by the Romanian National Cyber Security Directorate with the support of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the event took place in Bucharest as well as online. Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar stated that “The Blue OLEx exercise is the opportunity for a practical assessment of and possible improvements to the standard operating processes to be followed in case of a cyber crisis. The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity supports EU Member States in their efforts to test and strengthen the efficiency of the procedures to be implemented should large-scale cross-border incidents occur.” Blue OLEx 2021: Key Takeaways This third edition of the table-top Blueprint Operational Level Exercise (Blue OLEx) marks the first anniversary of operation of the Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe). This is also the first year that the same scenario is tested at technical and operational levels: At the technical level with CySOPEx 2021, by the CSIRTs Network, the network of EU Member States’ appointed CSIRTs and CERT-EU established by the NIS Directive; At the operational level, where CyCLONE operates, with both CySOPex 2021, the exercise tailored for the CyCLONe Officers and; BlueOlex 2021 the exercise tailored for the high-level actors of national cybersecurity authorities. Role of the EU CyCLONe in Blue OLEx 2021 The Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe) is a cooperation network for Member States national authorities in charge of cyber crisis management to collaborate and develop timely information sharing and situational awareness based on tools and support provided by the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, which serves as the CyCLONe Secretariat. The objective of the CyCLONe’s is to contribute to the implementation of the European Commission's Blueprint for rapid emergency response in case of a large-scale cross-border cyber incident or crisis. The results of the Blue OLEx 2021 will therefore feed into developing and enhancing the standard operating procedures of the EU CyCLONe and help shape the future response to large-scale cross-border cyber incident or crisis in the EU. Objectives of the Blue OLEx 2021 The exercise tests the role of the high-level actors in the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) of the EU CyCLONe, and to: improve on situational awareness and information sharing processes based on results; develop roles and responsibilities of the CyCLONe both at high-level actors and officer’s levels; identify improvements and/or potential gaps in the standardised way of responding to incidents and crises (namely CyCLONe Standard Operating Procedures); enhance the relationship among the members of the cybersecurity high-level actors of national cybersecurity authorities of CyCLONe to strengthen coordination in case of large-scale cross-border cyber incident or crisis affecting EU citizens and businesses. Who was involved? The event gathered high level actors from the competent authorities in charge of cyber crisis management and/or cyber policy of 22 Member States. It also included the participation of the European Commission. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity participates both as exercise organiser and as the secretariat of the EU CyCLONe. The CyCLONe in a nutshell The EU CyCLONe was launched in 2020 during the 2nd edition of the BlueOLEx. The goals of EU CyCLONe are to: establish a network to enabling the cooperation of the appointed national agencies and authorities in charge of cyber crisis management; provide the missing link between the EU CSIRTs Network (technical level) and the EU political level. Considering the importance of the network within the EU cybersecurity landscape, the European Commission proposal for the revised NIS Directive includes a provision for the formal establishment of the European Cyber Crises Liaison Organisation Network (EU CyCLONe). The role of Romania in the EU CyCLONe initiative A first BLUE OLEx pilot-exercise was organised in Paris in 2019 following the initiative of France and Spain, respectively, within the NIS Cooperation Group. Romania strongly supported this initiative during the EU Presidency. This year, the execise is hosted by the recently established Romanian National Cyber Security Directorate. What is the role of ENISA in operational cooperation? By coordinating both the secretariat of the EU CyCLONe and the CSIRTs Network, ENISA means to synchronise the technical and operational levels and all actors involved in the EU to collaborate and respond to large-scale incidents and crises by providing the best tools and support by: Enabling operation and information exchange by resorting to infrastructure, tools and expertise; Acting as a facilitator (switchboard) between the different networks, the technical and operational communities as well as decision makers responsible for crisis management; Providing the infrastructure and support for exercises and training sessions. Background Blue OLEx is a high-level event organised each year by one Member State and supported by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, in collaboration with the European Commission. It aims to test the EU preparedness in the event of a cyber-related crisis affecting the EU Member States and to strengthen the cooperation between the national cybersecurity authorities, the European Commission and ENISA.

This year’s edition featured the introduction of a new activity to allow participants from different teams, hence from different nationalities, to work together on international cooperation. In 2022, ENISA will organise the first International Cybersecurity Challenge in Athens, Greece. More details on this competition will be published on ENISA website. #CyberBecause Launched on 7 September, the #CyberBecause campaign aims to promote cybersecurity careers and provide role models for young people. There is more to cybersecurity than simply hacking – and what’s more, anyone can forge a career in cybersecurity, regardless of background. The number of cybersecurity professionals needs to grow by 89% globally just to meet the current demand. Yet careers in cybersecurity are far more diverse than many people think. A cybersecurity career can take many avenues and can expand beyond technical skills whether IT, engineering, finance, law, communications, policy or any other fields. Using the #CyberBecause hashtag, we encourage all cybersecurity professionals to share their story of how they started their career and education. Let’s meet again next year! The 2022 edition of the European Cybersecurity Challenge will take place in Vienna, Austria. Stay tuned on the ECSC website. Background In a world, that is changing fast, young people hold the key to innovation. The ENISA European Cyber Security Challenge was born out of this philosophy to encourage young people to pursue a career in cybersecurity. The European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC) is an annual exercise, coordinated by the European Union Agency for cybersecurity. The event offers a platform for young cyber talents across Europe to gather and engage in networking over a unique opportunity to experience cooperation in trying to resolve a cybersecurity problem. The ECSC is intended to encourage young people to pursue a career in cybersecurity, by challenging and developing the participants’ skills needed in such extreme situations and connecting them with industry.

ENISA_PR_0006	2021-09-30	PR	Uniting to raise awareness on Cyber Threats: European Cybersecurity Month 2021	     The annual cybersecurity awareness campaign is coordinated by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) and is supported by the European Commission, EU Member States, Europol, the European Central Bank, European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries and more than 300 partners from the public and private sector. The month-long campaign promotes up-to-date cybersecurity recommendations to build trust in online services and support citizens in protecting their personal, financial and professional data online. Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President for a Europe Fit for the Digital Age, said: “We will not use technology if we don’t trust it; and trust comes from feeling safe. That’s why cybersecurity is really central to our digitalisation, and to the use of technology. Especially nowadays when due to the pandemic we have been doing so many things online: working, learning, shopping, and more. By adopting good cybersecurity habits, we are building a safe and secure digital life.” European Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: “Cyber-attacks put at risk our businesses, our critical infrastructures, our data, the functioning of our democracies. Cyber criminals exploit the slightest vulnerability in our digital environment. The European Cybersecurity Month campaign aims at helping everyone acquire the necessary skills to shield ourselves and our way of life against cyber threats. The campaign’s motto “Think Before U Click” is especially this year more relevant than ever”. EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar said: “The European Cybersecurity Month campaign this year is bringing EU citizens the information to use in their everyday lives and provide tips to protect themselves from cybersecurity threats. We are uniting with Member States and EU institutions to advance awareness of these threats and to build a trusted and cyber secure Europe.” The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the importance of cybersecurity. Now, more than ever, education on digital security is key for citizens to identify risks and react effectively to cyber threats. Each year, for the entire month of October, the ECSM brings together EU citizens, Member States, the European Commission, EU bodies, and governmental organisations, the private sector and academia to promote healthy cybersecurity habits under the motto ‘Think Before U Click’. Online activities, including trainings, conferences, quizzes, presentations and national campaigns, across Europe, and beyond, are held to boost awareness of cybersecurity risks and share the up-to-date guidelines and ways to mitigate them. This year’s ESCM campaign will again address security issues surrounding the digitalisation of everyday life, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Encouraging people to ‘Think Before U Click’, the 2021 campaign presents two cybersecurity themes to help EU citizens recognise and prepare for cyber threats. The first theme centres around ‘Being Cyber Secure From Home’ by providing tips on how one can remain cyber secure when doing online transactions, communicating, working or studying online. Advice will be provided on good cyber hygiene for everyday practices online. The second theme provides ‘First Aid’ guidelines of what to do in case of a cyber incident. The goal of this theme is to encourage citizens to have a heightened awareness of the most common cyber threats and to provide advice on how to react in case one falls victim of online shopping frauds, when their credit card and/or bank account has been compromised and when their social media account has been hacked. Real-life stories of victims will be shared in the form of interviews and videos. The official website of the ECSM campaign is cybersecuritymonth.eu. The website acts as a ‘hub’ of cybersecurity information and includes a page to register activities related to awareness raising open to the public, and dedicated Member State campaign material in each local language (all 24 official EU languages are represented) as welll as the visual guidelines of the campaign for download. The ECSM also features a cybersecurity quiz for users to test their knowledge, and an interactive map of participating countries, giving information on services available in each country to report and get advice when one falls victim of a cyberattack.

ENISA_NEWS_0007	2021-09-22	NEWS	Moving forward in securing Online Trust via the Digital Wallets	 Electronic signatures, electronic seals and other online trust services have become a staple in the life of many Europeans. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, a key aspect to ensure a viable business model for qualified trust service providers was an increasing usage of online trusted services among European citizens, businesses and public administrations in an online mode.  This new reality across the EU has highlighted the security concerns of remote identification and authentication processes. The necessity for a new framework for EU digital identity became apparent. The European Commission presented last June a new framework for the EU digital identity by offering to citizens and businesses the digital wallets that will allow EU citizens to retain their documents such as national digital identities, licences, diplomas and bank credentials securely in their smartphone. The wallet should also allow them to log in to online services across the EU and to electronically sign their documents. On September 21st, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) in collaboration with the European Commission delivered the 7th consecutive ‘’Trust Service Forum’’. It attracted over to 1000 participants and brought more than forty experts, service providers, conformity assessment, supervisory bodies and national authorities together, to discuss the online trust market and its emerging issues under the European Commission’s Regulation 910/2014, on electronic identification and trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS Regulation). On 22nd September, D-TRUST in cooperation with TÜViT and the European School of Management and Technology (ESMT), held the 13th CA-Day. Both conferences were held in a hybrid format, with physical presence for the panellists at the ESMT premises in Berlin and virtually for the participants. The forum was jointly opened by the European Commission’s Director of Digital Society, Trust and Cybersecurity Ms. Lorena Boix Alonso and ENISA’s Head of Policy Development and Implementation Unit Mr. Evangelos Ouzounis and it was consisted of three main distinct blocks. In the first one, the panellists discussed the new ‘’EU Digital Identity Framework- bringing opportunity to wider use of online trust solutions across the EU’’. The concept of decentralised online identity, that gives back control to users over their personal data and leverages the use of an identity wallet, was additionally discussed. Second block focused on certification and standardisation efforts and the third one on the trust service market – current state of play, opportunities and outlook. Panellists had also the opportunity to further elaborate on the upcoming revisions of the eIDAS Regulation that proposes to further extend its application to the private sector and to promote trusted digital identities across the EU. Background The Trust Services Forum acts as a platform for participants to share their good practices on the implementation of trust services; review the standards, implementing acts and technical guidelines within the eIDAS; and discuss strategies to promote the adoption of qualified trust services. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity supports the Commission on the implementation of the eIDAS by providing security recommendations for the implementation of trust services, mapping technical and regulatory requirements, promoting the deployment of qualified trust services in Europe and raising awareness among users on securing their e-transactions. Under the EU Cybersecurity Act of 2019, the Agency gained an extended mandate to explore the area of electronic identification (eIDs) included in the regulation. EU's Digital Wallet's proposal The Commission on the 3rd June 2021 proposed a framework for a European Digital Identity which will be available to all EU citizens, residents, and businesses in the EU. Citizens will be able to prove their identity and share electronic documents from their European Digital Identity wallets with the click of a button on their phone. They will be able to access online services with their national digital identification, which will be recognised throughout Europe. Large platforms are proposed to accept the use of European Digital Identity wallets upon request of the user, for example to prove their age. Use of the European Digital Identity wallet will always be at the choice of the user. The new European Digital Identity Wallets will enable all Europeans to access services online without having to use private identification methods or unnecessarily sharing personal data. With this solution they will have full control of the data they share.

ENISA_NEWS_0009	2021-09-13	NEWS	Risky business or a leap of faith? A risk based approach to optimise cybersecurity certification	 The Methodology for Sectoral Cybersecurity Assessments (SCSA Methodology) in a nutshell The Methodology for a Sectoral Cybersecurity Assessment - (SCSA Methodology) was developed to enable the preparation of EU cybersecurity certification schemes for sectoral ICT infrastructures and ecosystems. SCSA aims at market acceptance of cybersecurity certification deployments and supports the requirements of market stakeholders and the EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA). In particular, SCSA endorses the identification of security and certification requirements based on risks associated with the “intended use” of the specific ICT products, services and processes. The SCSA Methodology makes available to the ENISA stakeholders a comprehensive ICT security assessment instrument that includes all aspects pertinent to sectoral ICT systems and provides thorough content for the implementation of ICT security and cybersecurity certification. While SCSA draws from widely accepted standards, in particular ISO/IEC 27000-series and ISO/IEC 15408-series, the proposed enhancements tackle multi-stakeholder systems and the specific security and assurance level requirements concerning ICT products, processes and cybersecurity certification schemes. This is achieved by introducing the following features and capabilities: Business processes, roles of sectoral stakeholders and business objectives are documented at ecosystem level, overarching the ICT subsystems of the individual stakeholders. Stakeholders are invited to actively contribute to the identification and rating of ICT security risks that could affect their business objectives. A dedicated method associates the stakeholders’ ratings of risks with the security and assurance level requirements to dedicated ICT subsystems, components or processes of the sectoral ICT system. SCSA specifies a consistent approach to implement security and assurance levels across all parts of the sectoral ICT system and provides all information required by the sectoral cybersecurity certification schemes. Benefits of the SCSA Methodology for stakeholders The sectoral cybersecurity security assessment provides a comprehensive approach of the multi-faceted aspects presented by complex multi-stakeholder ICT systems and it features the following benefits: The security of a sectoral system requires synchronisation across all participating stakeholders. SCSA introduces comparability of security and assurance levels between different stakeholders’ systems and system components. SCSA enables building open multi-stakeholder ecosystems even among competitors to the benefit of suppliers and customers. The risk-based approach supports transparency and a sound balance between the cost for security and certification and the benefit of mitigating ICT-security-related business risks for each concerned stakeholder. Security measures can focus on the critical components, optimising the security architecture of the sectoral system, hence minimising cost of security. SCSA generates accurate and consistent information on security and certification level requirements for all relevant ICT subsystems, components or processes. On this basis, suppliers can match their products to their customers’ requirements. SCSA supports the integration of existing risk management tools and information security management systems (ISMS). Due to a consistent definition of assurance levels, the re-use of certificates from other cybersecurity certification schemes is supported. Target audience - Who is it meant for? SCSA aims at an expert level audience, in particular ICT experts, ICT security experts and decision-makers in charge of sectoral multi-stakeholder systems, as well as suppliers. Examples of relevant market sectors include mobile networks / 5G, electronic identity (eID), eHealth, payments, Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and automotive. Next steps After successfully passing a pilot implementation in a 5G context, SCSA will be used towards the development of the EU 5G candidate cybersecurity certification scheme.

ENISA_NEWS_0010	2021-09-08	NEWS	New Tool is another step towards securing the Digital Future of SMEs	 According to the European Commission’s data, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) constitute 99% of all businesses in the EU and employ around 100 million people. In order to overcome the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic many SMEs applied new business continuity measures and turned to new technologies such as adopting to cloud services, upgrading their internet services, improving their websites, and enabling staff to work remotely. Although SMEs have turned to new technologies, they often fail to raise the level of their security, mainly due to the lack of funding and cybersecurity guidelines. The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity is providing continuous support to SMEs. In doing so the “SecureSME” Tool has been created as a means to raise awareness and help SMEs become digitally secure. The “SecureSME’’ tool is a one-stop shop for European SMEs, which provides related cybersecurity recommendations, guidelines and tips in a simplistic and user friendly manner. The goal of the tool is to support those businesses in securing their ICT services and infrastructure from cyberattacks and ensure business continuity. The tool will be presented and become directly accessible to the public on the 8th September 2021, within the framework of the International Cybersecurity Forum (FIC 2021) in Lille, France. ENISA is an active participant to the fair dedicated to public and private cybersecurity operators, by running an awareness campaign dedicated to SMEs. What is the “SecureSME” Tool? Cybersecurity doesn’t necessarily have to be costly for SMEs to implement and maintain. There are several measures that can be implemented, without having to invest a large amount. ENISA’s ‘’SecureSME Tool’’ is a dedicated platform designed to support small and medium size businesses in their efforts to become digitally secure. This is achieved through the provision of practical and concise cyber tips and guidelines on how to secure ICT infrastructure. The “SecureSME’’ tool presents the following main sections of particular interest to SMEs: Cyber tips that include instructions on how to: Protect Employees Enhance Processes Strengthen technical measures Overcome Covid19 issues Videos Guidelines in relation to SME cybersecurity published by ENISA and Member States’ National Authorities EU H2020 related projects Background “SecureSME’’ tool comes as the next step following the publication of the “Cybersecurity for SMEs” report by ENISA last June. The report provides SMEs with advice on how to successfully cope with cybersecurity challenges, particularly those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the report, ENISA also published a short cybersecurity guide in the form of a leaflet: “12 steps to securing your business”, which provides SMEs with practical high-level actions to better secure their systems and hence their businesses. The short cybersecurity guide, which is also accessible via the “SecureSME” Tool, is now translated in the following languages:  Czech, German, Greek, Spanish, French, Italian, Latvian, Polish, Portuguese and Romanian.

ENISA_NEWS_0011	2021-09-07	NEWS	Prague hosts a meeting of the best European talents in cybersecurity	 This year's ECSC will be held in Prague for the first time since its inception and will take place from 28 September until 1 October 2021. The competition will be attended by 200 competing national teams players under the age of 25, winners of national cybersecurity competitions from the individual European countries and Canada. The teams will test their strengths in penetration testing, cryptography, reverse engineering, forensic analysis, and other challenging tasks. The ECSC is not just a competition, the aim of this annual activity is to actively address the global problem of the lack of IT professionals and cybersecurity in general. The competition aims to motivate young people to work in IT and to popularise the issue of cybersecurity. The month of October is the European Cybersecurity Month that aims to advance awareness of cybersecurity and build trust in online services. #CyberBecause Today, we launch the #CyberBecause campaign to promote the cybersecurity careers and provide role models for young people. There is more to cybersecurity than simply hacking – and what’s more, anyone can forge a career in cybersecurity, no matter what their background is. The number of cybersecurity professionals needs to grow by 89% globally just to meet current demand. Yet careers in cybersecurity are far more diverse than many people think. A cybersecurity career can take you down many paths, whether your experience lies in IT, engineering, finance, law, communications, policy and much much more. Using the #CyberBecause hashtag, we encourage all cybersecurity professionals to share their story of how they started their career and education. ECSC 2021 This year, the organisation of competition tasks was prepared by the winning team of the national competition of the Czech Republic, in cooperation with professionals from the Czech Republic and ENISA. The set-up of the entire competition as a sci-fi story taking place in the distant future where the competitors in a role of cyber experts need to defend the space colonisation expedition from hacker attacks. The introductory short story was written for ECSC 2021 by the Czech science fiction writer Jan Kotouč, the author of novels from the science fiction genre and alternative history. The European Finals in Prague will be sponsored by the Czech Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Education. Mario Campolargo, Director General of DG Informatics (DIGIT) at the European Commission will present the awards to the winning teams. Without the support and help of all partners, it would not be possible to carry out such an extensive and significant activity. Further Information On 29 September, a press conference will be held in Prague to provide further information on the European Cybersecurity Challenge. During the Challenge, a conference will also take place on the topic of ‘Does the human brain stand a chance?’ For more information about the competition, please visit the web pages www.ecsc.eu and www.ecsc2021.cz For more information on the #CyberBecause and to explore our community stories, check out https://ecsc.eu/about/cyberbecause Contacts Erika Pupišová as the ECSC 2021 main coordinator  M: 731 475 547 | E: erika.pupisova@ecsc2021.cz Adrian Belmonte as the ENISA coordinator for the ECSC M: +306985173256| E: adrian.belmonte@enisa.europa.eu Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0014	2021-07-29	PR	Understanding the increase in Supply Chain Security Attacks	 Supply chain attacks have been a concern for cybersecurity experts for many years because the chain reaction triggered by one attack on a single supplier can compromise a network of providers. Malware is the attack technique that attackers resort to in 62% of attacks. According to the new ENISA report - Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks, which analysed 24 recent attacks, strong security protection is no longer enough for organisations when attackers have already shifted their attention to suppliers. This is evidenced by the increasing impact of these attacks such as downtime of systems, monetary loss and reputational damage. Supply chain attacks are now expected to multiply by 4 in 2021 compared to last year. Such new trend stresses the need for policymakers and the cybersecurity community to act now. This is why novel protective measures to prevent and respond to potential supply chain attacks in the future while mitigating their impact need to be introduced urgently. Juhan Lepassaar, EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director said: “Due to the cascading effect of supply chain attacks, threat actors can cause widespread damage affecting businesses and their customers all at once. With good practices and coordinated actions at EU level, Member States will be able to reach a similar level of capabilities raising the common level of cybersecurity in the EU.” What is a supply chain? A supply chain is the combination of the ecosystem of resources needed to design, manufacture and distribute a product. In cybersecurity, a supply chain includes hardware and software, cloud or local storage and distribution mechanisms. Why is a good level of cybersecurity not good enough? Composed of an attack on one or more suppliers with a later attack on the final target, namely the customer, supply chain attacks may take months to succeed. In many instances, such an attack may even go undetected for a long time. Similarly to Advanced Persistence Threat (APT) attacks, supply chain attacks are usually targeted, quite complex and costly with attackers probably planning them well in advance. All such aspects reveal the degree of sophistication of the adversaries and the persistence in seeking to succeed. The report reveals that an organisation could be vulnerable to a supply chain attack even when its own defences are quite good. The attackers explore new potential highways to infiltrate organisations by targeting their suppliers. Moreover, with the almost limitless potential of the impact of supply chain attacks on numerous customers, these types of attacks are becoming increasingly common. In order to compromise the targeted customers, attackers focused on the suppliers’ code in about 66% of the reported incidents. This shows that organisations should focus their efforts on validating third-party code and software before using them to ensure these were not tampered with or manipulated. For about 58% of the supply chain incidents analysed, the customer assets targeted were predominantly customer data, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data and intellectual property. For 66% of the supply chain attacks analysed, suppliers did not know, or failed to report on how they were compromised. However, less than 9% of the customers compromised through supply chain attacks did not know how the attacks occurred. This highlights the gap in terms of maturity in cybersecurity incident reporting between suppliers and end-users. The recommendations, in a nutshell: Apply good practices and engage in coordinated actions at EU level. The impact of attacks on suppliers may have far reaching consequences because of the increased interdependencies and complexities of the techniques used. Beyond the damages on affected organisations and third parties, there is a deeper cause for concern when classified information is exfiltrated and national security is at stake or when consequences of a geopolitical nature could emerge as a result. In this complex environment for supply chains, establishing good practices and getting involved in coordinated actions at EU level are both important to support all Member States in developing similar capabilities – to reach a common level of security. The report issues an extensive number of recommendations for customers to manage the supply chain cybersecurity risk and to manage the relationship with the suppliers. Recommendations for customers include: identifying and documenting suppliers and service providers; defining risk criteria for different types of suppliers and services such as supplier & customer dependencies, critical software dependencies, single points of failure; monitoring of supply chain risks and threats; managing suppliers over the whole lifecycle of a product or service, including procedures to handle end-of-life products or components; classifying of assets and information shared with or accessible to suppliers, and defining relevant procedures for accessing and handling them. The report also suggests possible actions to ensure that the development of products and services complies with security practices. Suppliers are advised to implement good practices for vulnerability and patch management for instance. Recommendations for suppliers include: ensuring that the infrastructure used to design, develop, manufacture, and deliver products, components and services follows cybersecurity practices; implementing a product development, maintenance and support process that is consistent with commonly accepted product development processes; monitoring of security vulnerabilities reported by internal and external sources that includes used third-party components; maintaining an inventory of assets that includes patch-relevant information.  Download the Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks Background The cyber threat landscape is constantly evolving. Both policy makers and practitioners need to have access to up-to-date and accurate information on the current threat landscape, supported by threat intelligence. To respond to this need, the ENISA Threat Landscape has been published on an annual basis since 2012. These reports are based on publicly available data and provides an independent view on observed threats, threat agents, threat trends and attack vectors. ENISA set up an Ad-Hoc Working Group on Cyber Threat Landscapes in order to interact with a broad range of stakeholders and to receive advice in designing, updating and reviewing the methodology needed to draw cyber threat landscapes, including the annual ENISA Threat Landscape.  The Agency provides threat analysis on a range of emerging technologies and challenges including recent threat landscapes on Artificial Intelligence and 5G. On the issue of supply chain attacks, ENISA released the Supply Chain Integrity Report in 2012 (and updated in 2015) which identifies the nature of these threats and examines the possible strategies to counter them.

ENISA_PR_0015	2021-07-26	PR	Telecom & Trust Services Incidents in 2020: System Failures on the Rise	 Incident reporting is the invaluable tool used across the EU for the notification of significant cybersecurity incidents, their impact assessment and the evaluation of trends. The national regulatory authorities (NRAs) of each EU Member State provide a summary of these incidents to the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA on a yearly basis but also on an ad-hoc basis. The two reports published today provide an extensive analysis on incident root causes, the impact of incidents that occurred in 2020 and assesses multiannual trends. Juhan Lepassaar, EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director said: “Incident reporting allows to make projections and to continually maintain a view over the cyber threat landscape. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity is dedicated to support national authorities and the wider cybersecurity community to ensure coherence, coordination and efficiency in incident reporting and analysis.” EU-wide agreed thresholds apply in how incidents are selected although Member States have the right to deviate at national level. Such reports therefore only provide information related to incidents reported by Member states. However, as thresholds can change over the years, ENISA takes precautionary measures to perform the analysis of trends in a coherent and informed way. Why is incident reporting important? The major objective of telecom services and trust services incident reporting is to help national authorities with their supervision tasks, to map cybersecurity trends as well crosscutting issues and sector weaknesses. Aggregating this information is important to understand gaps and to identify and address emerging issues. ENISA has been supporting the EU telecom security authorities since 2011 and the supervisory bodies for EU trust services since 2016 on the respective incident reporting. The role of ENISA is to develop procedures, information gathering templates and data processing tools in relation to these incidents and to publish a report every year on the previous year’s incidents. What are the key takeaways of the reports on 2020 incidents? Telecom Security Incidents 2020 - Annual Report The annual report on telecom security incidents for 2020 reveals that faulty software changes and/or updates constitute a major aggravating factor in terms of impact resulting in 346 million hours lost which is equivalent to 40 % of the total number of hours lost. System failures continue to dominate as the most frequent cause of incidents leading to severe adverse impact. The total of incidents caused by human errors or third-party failures remain similar to the levels seen in 2019. The multiannual trends show that although system failures continue to be the most frequent cause of incidents (61%), these incidents are decreasing in size. The analysis also reveals that incidents cause by human errors have been on the increase between 2016 and 2020, reaching 26% of the total number of incidents. Trust Services Security Incidents 2020 - Annual Report The annual report on trust services incidents also reveals system failures remain the dominant root cause of incidents with human errors ranking second. Overall, the level of severity remains steadily low, which indicates that Trust Service Providers (TSPs) report more incidents, even those that are less severe. In 2020, 69% of total incidents had an impact on qualified trust services when compared with approximately 33% of incidents reported on non-qualified trust services. The study highlights a concern over non-qualified trust services incidents considered to be under reported although such services are very widely used. A good example of this is website certificates used by 80 % of websites globally. The rather limited number of incident reports on non-qualified trust services under the eIDAS regulation suggests there is still under-reporting in the specific market. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that one Member State reported 11 incidents during 2020. Besides, the analysis also revealed PDF sign-in vulnerabilities with the emerging of new “shadow attacks” affecting a wide range of software products. The information collected and analysed in the telecom and trust services security incident reports is stored on CIRAS, an online visual tool that allows the analysis of incidents and can be used to generate custom graphs. ENISA is considering issuing a consolidated report in 2022. More reporting activities are expected in the future with the revision of the NIS directive. Event – Trust Services Forum 2021 Together with the European Commission, ENISA will organise the Trust Service Forum on 21st September 2021. This edition takes place for the 7th year in 2021 following its inception in 2015. Collocated with D-TRUST/TUVIT CA Day on 22 September 2021, the event is to take place in Berlin, Germany, provided that the travelling and gathering controls allow for this. More information: Trust Services Forum - CA Day 2021 Background information On electronic communications, providers in the EU have to notify telecom security incidents having significant impact to the national authorities for telecom security in their country. At the beginning of every calendar year, the authorities send summary reports about these incidents to the EU Agency for Cybersecurity. Established in 2010, the European Competent Authorities for Secure Electronic Communications expert group (ECASEC), or former Article 13a group, consists of about 100 experts from national telecom security authorities from EU Member States, European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and European Economic Area (EEA) countries, as well as EU candidate countries. Electronic trust services include a range of electronic services around digital signatures, digital certificates, electronic seals, timestamps, etc. used to secure electronic, online, transactions. The eIDAS regulation is the EU wide legal framework meant to ensure the interoperability and security of the electronic trust services across the EU. One of the goals of the eIDAS is to ensure electronic transactions can have the same legal validity as traditional paper - based transactions, to create a framework in which a digital signature has the same value as a hand-written signature. Security is an important pillar of the overall framework.

ENISA_NEWS_0016	2021-07-16	NEWS	Remote Identity Proofing: How to spot the Fake from the Real?	 What is identity proofing? Traditionally, proofing an individual’s identity consists in physically providing evidence of an individual’s identity, by presenting a government issued ID. Remote identify proofing methods are a way to identify individuals, without relying on physical presence. Remote identity proofing has received a lot of attention recently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Remote identity proofing is usually done over a webcam or a customer’s mobile phone, where the customers show themselves along with their government issued document – an identity card or passport. ENISA will soon publish a report focusing on remote face presentation attacks, where someone attempts to impersonate someone else, or create a fake identity. Remote identity proofing can be used in a variety of contexts where trust in the identity of a natural or legal person is essential – such as financial services, e commerce, travel industry, human resources, matching platforms (including delivery and ride-hailing services), public administrations, online gambling and many other sectors. Why a workshop on remote identity proofing attacks? With the remote identity proofing methods used today in the EU, you can remotely create a bank account or obtain a qualified electronic signature and sign legal documents. However, resorting to these solutions make it necessary to understand and analyse the different possible attacks. The workshop presented and discussed technologically enhanced deluding attacks and explored the countermeasures, to finally peek into the future and anticipate challenges to come. The workshop was also intended to validate the analysis and key elements of the upcoming report “Remote Identity Proofing Practices: Attack Scenarios” which ENISA expects to publish in October. What did the workshop focus on? The first part of the workshop was dedicated to the threat landscape and included a presentation of the desktop research results and preliminary findings. The attack scenarios explored consisted of: deepfake video injection; high-quality 3D silicone masks; video manipulation of an identity document. Participants were also asked to identify a deepfake participant hidden among workshop panellists. The second part focused on the emerging threats and the future of spoofs. Each part included a question and answer session to allow for an interactive discussion between participants and panellists. Nowadays, most of remote ID attacks are low tech, with attackers presenting fake IDs or presenting someone else’s face on a display (so-called replay attack). However, deepfake attacks are expected to become more frequent and harder to detect. As a consequence, countermeasures will need to evolve as well. Both active (i.e. asking the user to read random set of numbers) and passive (i.e. face texture analysis) security controls will play their role in the future, and synergies between AI and human operators will need to be further developed in order to spot the fakes. With over 180 participants, the interactive sessions made it an engaging and positively received workshop. Who was the workshop intended for? Industry – EU companies and other public or academic organisations with a focus on EU remote identity technology providers; National governments and other relevant public bodies, academia and other interested parties; Trust service providers and identity providers; Conformity assessment bodies and supervisory bodies; Security researchers and the wider security community. Background Electronic identification under the eIDAS regulation constitutes a digital solution designed to provide proof of identity for citizens or organisations, in order to access online services or perform online transactions. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity has been at the forefront of the developments in the eIDAS regulation since 2013. The Agency has been supporting the Commission and the Member States in the area of trust services in many ways, including but without being limited to the following: security recommendations for the implementation of trust services; mapping technical and regulatory requirements; promoting the deployment of qualified trust services across Europe; raising awareness for relying parties and end-users. The EU Cybersecurity Act of 2019 strengthened the Agency’s role is supporting the implementation of eIDAS.  The European Digital Identity is intended to be available to all EU citizens, residents and businesses in order to identify themselves or provide confirmation of personal information. Its purpose is to facilitate access to public and private digital services across the European Union. Last year ENISA mapped the full landscape of remote identity proofing methods and countermeasures in a report publish in March of this year: The Agency continues to engage in such work which is expected to develop in the future. Event announcement – save the date for the Trust Services Forum 2021 Together with the European Commission, ENISA will organise the Trust Service Forum on 21st September 2021. This edition takes place for the 7th year in 2021 following its inception in 2015. Collocated with D-TRUST/TUVIT CA Day on 22 September 2021, the event is to take place in Berlin, Germany, provided that the current travelling and gathering restrictions will be lifted by then.

ENISA_PR_0017	2021-06-28	PR	Phishing most common Cyber Incident faced by SMEs	 Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are considered to be the backbone of Europe's economy. 25 millions of SMEs are active today in the European Union and employ more than 100 million workers. The report Cybersecurity for SMEs ENISA issues today provides advice for SMEs to successfully cope with cybersecurity challenges, particularly those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. With the current crisis, traditional businesses had to resort to technologies such as QR codes or contactless payments they had never used before. Although SMEs have turned to such new technologies to maintain their business, they often failed to increase their security in relation to these new systems. Research and real-life experience show that well prepared organisations deal with cyber incidents in a much more efficient way than those failing to plan or lacking the capabilities they need to address cyber threats correctly. Juhan Lepassaar, EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director said: “SMEs cybersecurity and support is at the forefront of the EU’s cybersecurity strategy for the digital decade and the Agency is fully dedicated to support the SME community in improving their resilience to successfully transform digitally.” In addition to the report, ENISA also publishes today the Cybersecurity Guide for SMEs: “12 steps to securing your business”. The short cybersecurity guide provides SMEs with practical high-level actions to better secure their systems, hence their businesses.   Based on an extended desktop research, an extensive survey and targeted interviews, the report identifies those pre-existing cybersecurity challenges worsened by the impact of the pandemic crisis. Key findings 85% of the SMEs surveyed agree that cybersecurity issues would have a serious detrimental impact on their businesses with 57% saying they would most likely go out of business. Out of almost 250 SMEs surveyed, 36% reported that they had experienced an incident in the last 5 years. Nonetheless, cyberattacks are still not considered as a major risk for a large number of SMEs and a belief remains that cyber incidents are only targeting larger organisations. However, the study reveals that phishing attacks are among the most common cyber incidents SMEs are likely to be exposed to, in addition to ransomware attacks, stolen laptops, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) frauds. For instance, with the concerns induced by the pandemic, cyber criminals seek to compromise accounts using phishing emails with Covid-19 as a subject. CEO frauds are other decoys meant to lure an employee into acting upon the instructions of a fraudulent email displayed as if sent from their CEO, and usually requesting a payment to be performed in urgency under business-like circumstances. The report unveils the following challenges SMEs are faced with: Low awareness of cyber threats; Inadequate protection for critical and sensitive information; Lack of budget to cover costs incurred for implementing cybersecurity measures; Availability of ICT cybersecurity expertise and personnel; Absence of suitable guidelines tailored to the SMEs sector; Moving online; Low management support. How to address those challenges? The recommendations issued fall into three categories: People People play an essential role in the cybersecurity ecosystem. The report draws attention to the importance of responsibility, employee buy-in and awareness, cybersecurity training and cybersecurity policies as well as third party management in relation to confidential and/or sensitive information. Processes Monitoring internal business processes include performing audits, incident planning and response, passwords, software patches and data protection. Technical At the technical level, a number of aspects should be considered in relation to network security, anti-virus, encryption, security monitoring, physical security and the securing of backups. Target audience The report intends to deliver actionable guidance to the owners and employees of SMEs. In addition, this work can be of use to other entities involved in the SME ecosystem, such as SMEs national and European associations, policymakers and implementers, SME ICT providers and others. Background For nearly 15 years, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity has been pushing forward cybersecurity initiatives to assist SMEs to integrate cybersecurity into their digital environments. Starting in 2006 and 2007, the Agency published two Information Package for SMEs reports, providing risk assessment and management methodologies for SMEs. In 2010, the Agency published the Business Continuity for SMEs report to help facilitate IT knowledge transfer to SMEs. In 2015, the Cloud Security Guide for SMEs report was released to assist SMEs understand the security risks and opportunities regarding cloud services. Two years later, the Agency published the Guidelines for SMEs on the security of personal data processing. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity released last year a series of tips to help businesses face the rapidly changing digital sphere during the pandemic: Tips for selecting and using online communication tools; Tips for cybersecurity when buying and selling online; Tips for cybersecurity when working from home; Top ten cyber hygiene tips for SMEs during covid-19 pandemic. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity and the National Cyber Security Alliance published a joint checklist for SME in November 2020, offering businesses on both sides of the Atlantic a basic guide to maintaining digital security.

ENISA_PR_0018	2021-06-23	PR	EU Boost against cyberattacks: EU Agency for Cybersecurity welcomes proposal for the Joint Cyber Unit	" The concept of the Joint Cyber Unit (JCU), suggested two years ago by European Commission President von der Leyen, is an important step towards completing the European cybersecurity crisis management framework. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) welcomes the proposal for the Commission Recommendation to build a Joint Cyber Unit and the role it is foreseen to play. The Cybersecurity Act mandates the Agency to cooperate at the operational level and establish synergies with Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. The JCU helps the Agency to achieve this in a structural manner. The support the EU Agency for Cybersecurity would provide to building a Joint Cyber Unit comes as a reinforcement of the provisions set out in the Cybersecurity Act, which has widened the scope of the activities of the Agency. This new initiative is an important step on how the Agency can further contribute to achieve a higher common level of cybersecurity within the European Union. Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President for a Europe Fit for the Digital Age, said: ""Cybersecurity is a cornerstone of a digital and connected Europe. And in today’s society, responding to threats in a coordinated manner is paramount. The Joint Cyber Unit will contribute to that goal. Together we can really make a difference.” Margaritis Schinas, Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, said: ""The recent ransomware attacks should serve as a warning that we must protect ourselves against threats that could undermine our security and our European Way of Life. Today, we can no longer distinguish between online and offline threats. We need to pool all our resources to defeat cyber risks and enhance our operational capacity. Building a trusted and secure digital world, based on our values, requires commitment from all, including law enforcement.” Thierry Breton, Commissioner for the Internal Market, said: ""Today we have put in place an ambitious building block in protecting ourselves from cyber threats that are evolving rapidly and are becoming more complex. We have set clear milestones and timelines that will allow us to concretely improve crisis management cooperation in the EU. The Joint4 Cyber Unit leverages the expertise that is scattered across Europe and will enable us to not only detect threats but also react faster.” Juhan Lepassaar, EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director said: “The EU Agency for Cybersecurity is committed to support the Union and its Member States in the response to cyberattacks. The Joint Cyber Unit will build stronger relationships within the cybersecurity ecosystem and shape an effective framework for crisis management. Our future local office in Brussels will operate closely with the Unit to coordinate response, create situational awareness and ensure preparedness in times of crisis.” Cybersecurity Ecosystem Infographic EU Agency for Cybersecurity office in Brussels While the Agency’s headquarters remain in Athens, a bridge-head has become important to coordinate activities such as operational cooperation and incident response. By establishing this local office in Belgium, ENISA’s work will be further strengthened as a Brussels base will facilitate the implementation of the operational cooperation activities foreseen by the Cybersecurity Act. ENISA is dedicated to ensure that its seat in Greece will remain and expand in the coming years. Today, the European Commission gave their consent to the establishment of an ENISA office in Brussels while the Management Board of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity had already provided their prior consent. The Agency also received the positive opinion of the Hellenic and Belgian authorities. The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity will serve as secretariat for the preparatory phase of the JCU. Therefore, the Unit will be physically located next to the new Brussels office of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity and the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU institutions, bodies and agencies (CERT-EU). The Joint Cyber Unit and the role of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity The Joint Cyber Unit is considered as a concrete deliverable of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy and the EU Security Union Strategy to contribute to a secure digital economy and society. It aims to connect a number of cybersecurity communities using a common space designed to foster cooperation and allow existing networks to realise their full potential. EU Agency for Cybersecurity’s role in operational cooperation The role of ENISA is to support operational cooperation among Member States, Union Institutions, Bodies, Offices and Agencies. ENISA is mandated to ensure that an effective cooperation framework is in place among the operational actors within the Union in case of large-scale cross-border cyberattacks and crises. By coordinating both the secretariat of the EU CyCLONe and the CSIRTs Network, ENISA aims at synchronising the technical and operational levels and all actors involved in the EU to collaborate and respond to large-scale incidents and crises by providing the best tools and support.

ENISA_NEWS_0019	2021-06-22	NEWS	How to Help National Authorities deal with the Challenges of Mobile Networks Security?	 The series of educational webinars on mobile networks security topics was organised in collaboration with OTE Academy. These webinars, scheduled over the month of June covered the three generations of mobile networks, namely 3G, 4G and 5G and also addressed the migration from these generations to 5G. Why a webinar series on mobile network security? Further development of specialised knowledge on mobile networks security is considered even more necessary and relevant today in light of the wider 5G rollout in Europe. Besides, investigating the related challenges and addressing the capabilities in this area has become increasingly pressing now that the European Electronic and Communications Code (known as the EECC) needs to be implemented and transposed into national laws. What did the webinars focus on? The webinars focused on four different topics, as follows: Basic security concepts for 3G, 4G and 5G The participants received focused training sessions on architecture, interfaces and a high-level security framework for all three generations of mobile networks.  Signalling Security Topics covered included the protection of signalling over the air interface, the transport network and signalling interconnection security. Security considerations for migrations from 3G/4G to 5G The participants examined scenarios of migration from 3G/4G to 5G, security vulnerabilities and mitigation controls in 3G, 4G and 5G. Security risks and mitigation controls for Non-Standalone (NSA) 5G deployment In addition, the training encompassed 5G core network and virtualisation techniques, as well as cloud security risks and mitigation controls. Topics extensively explored included the security vulnerabilities of Non-Standalone (NSA) 5G deployments and the relevant security framework and procedures. Target audience More than 70 experts from the 5G cybersecurity work stream of the NIS Cooperation Group and those of the European Competent Authorities for Secure Electronic Communications Expert Group (ECASEC EG, former Article 13a EG) formed the participants who engaged in the webinars. ENISA plans further knowledge building activities for its stakeholders foreseen to take place during the 3rd quarter of 2021.  About ENISA’s knowledge building webinars These webinars are part of a broader series of knowledge building seminars that ENISA organises for national authorities in the EU on new technologies and the cybersecurity opportunities and risks associated with them. Previous seminars for national authorities covered topics such as cloud security, internet backbone security and applications of cryptography. The overarching goal of this initiative is continuous knowledge building on technology topics and related security challenges meant to implement the Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade of the EU.

ENISA_PR_0020	2021-06-18	PR	Pandemic urges strong measures to address risks on the security of personal data  	" Privacy goes hand in hand with security. This is what is aimed to be achieved with the EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy of December 2020. A harmonised approach in security and data protection is also evident to the recent proposal on European Digital Identity and the EU Regulation for Digital COVID-19 Certificates, which aim to ensure a high level of both cybersecurity and data protection. Juhan Lepassaar, EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director said: “The pandemic and recent technological innovations such as 5G and AI have highlighted the importance of a “by design” approach, for both security and data protection. The Annual Privacy Forum provides the opportunity for the different actors to enhance this approach together.” Lorena Boix Alonso, Director for Digital Society, Trust and Cybersecurity in the European Commission’s Directorate General for Communications Networks Content and Technology (DG CONNECT) said: ‘The COVID crisis has demonstrated the usefulness of electronic communications metadata in the fight against the pandemic. Therefore, clear and updated rules will help us to use these data in an even more optimal manner in order to protect European citizens. This trust environment will unlock the potential for our digital society with innovative solutions for the future.’ Aleid Wolfsen, European Data Protection Board Deputy Chair said: ""The EDPB is committed to supporting the co-legislators and be a part of ongoing discussions, especially in those areas where the rights to privacy and protection of personal data are important factors.” Wojciech Wiewiórowski, European Data Protection Supervisor stated “The world is watching us, Europe, on how we will frame the rules for Artificial Intelligence. The race to AI shall not justify cutting corners on the framing of the legal framework. We want it to be fair for people, and to bring additional protection, not any less to what is right in EU from a fundamental rights perspective.” Among 800 participants, policymakers, data protection practitioners, researchers, industry representatives and the wider privacy community connected online to discuss current privacy and data protection issues and emerging challenges on securing personal data. Key highlights of the conference This year’s APF welcomed keynote speeches from the Director of Directorate CNECT H, Digital Society, Trust and Cybersecurity, Lorena Boix Alonso, the European Data Protection Supervisor Wojciech Wiewiórowski, the Deputy Chair of the European Data Protection Board, Aleid Wolfsen and the General Director of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, Bjørn Erik Thon. On day one, researchers presented their work on implementing data protection principles and promoting compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The European Commission presented the EU Digital Principles initiative, which is part of the Commission’s vision for Europe’s digital transformation by 2030 and the European Fundamental Rights Agency presented the Agency’s work on Artificial Intelligence and fundamental rights. Later in the day, ENISA moderated a panel discussion on the security considerations of personal data in the “new” normality, discussing how the aftermath of the pandemic and new technologies such as AI could affect personal data processing.  Further to legal provisions, protection can also be achieved by deploying correctly appropriate security measures, such as pseudonymisation and encryption. On day two, a panel discussion on the draft ePrivacy Regulation took place with interventions from the European Parliament rapporteur MEP Birgit Sippel, Ursula Pachl from European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) and Antonio Muñez from the telecommunications sector (Telefónica). The discussion focused on the importance and relevance of the ePrivacy Regulation for the protection of confidentiality of communications and the processing of electronic communications metadata and its use in the fight against the pandemic. The ePrivacy Regulation will modernise the current rules and will enhance the protection of our citizens' rights to their privacy and confidentiality of communications. Researchers presented their work on Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) and the Norwegian Consumer Council discussed the traction between consumers and the online advertising industry. The final panel discussion was moderated by the European Data Protection Board where the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, the European Data Protection Supervisor and ENISA discussed how to engineer data protection principles into practical guidelines for developers. Conclusions As European Union we should continue to put forward and adopt legislative initiatives, such as ePrivacy Regulation, NIS2, AI, Digital Identity and DORA that promote a high level of protection and respect fundamental rights and freedoms. Similar to the recent legislative initiatives on AI and Digital Identity, we must provide assurance to the end-user not only on the level of cybersecurity but also on whether their personal data are being processed according to legal provisions. Security and data protection are two sides of the same coin. To achieve this, respect for fundamental rights is essential. This is why we need to develop the appropriate legal and policy framework. After the GDPR's recent third anniversary, it is now high time to progress with the ePrivacy Regulation that will complete the legislative framework. Implementation is another important challenge. There is no need though to start from scratch. We have to use available techniques and technologies, incorporate security and privacy by design and default into new products and services and adopt security measures proportional to the level of risk presented.

ENISA_NEWS_0022	2021-10-18	NEWS	EU National Telecom Authorities analyse Security Supervision and Latest Security Threats	 Launched more than 10 years ago, the European Competent Authorities for Secure Electronic Communications (ECASEC) group serves as a platform for collaboration and exchange of information among the national authorities supervising telecom security in Europe. The ECASEC group also develops and endorses guidelines for telecom security authorities on how to implement different aspects of EU telecom security policy. Besides the ECASEC meeting, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) hosted the 1st edition of the ENISA Telecom Security Forum on 13 October. The goal of this event, held in a hybrid format, was to bring together experts from both national authorities and the private sector to exchange views and discuss cybersecurity challenges and good practices. Highlights of the 35th ECASEC Expert Group meeting A total of more than 50 experts from national authorities supervising the European telecom sector in the EU, EFTA, EEA, and EU candidate countries attended the meeting held on 14th October, with almost a third of them being present physically. The meeting was the opportunity for the experts to follow an analysis of the supply chain threat landscape recently published by ENISA. BEREC also presented their report on the location of the Network Termination Points. The location of the Network Termination Points has an impact on whether an equipment is part of the public network or part of the telecommunications terminal equipment (TTE) and that distinction affects in turn the legal power of the National Regulatory Agencies (NRAs). ENISA introduced the main points of the upcoming ENISA reports on Consumer Outreach and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) Security and participants listened to an analysis of Confidentiality, Integrity and Authenticity attacks in public electronic communication networks. This type of attacks is of great interest for the members of the ECASEC Expert Group since the definition of security in the EECC includes also confidentiality of communications. Finally, the group dived into the recent Facebook outage and stressed the need for streamlining the incident reporting process so as to avoid unclear and overlapping obligations on providers and effectively cover cross-border incidents that involve several countries. The 1st edition of the ENISA telecom security forum in a nutshell A total of more than 250 telecom security experts met both physically in Athens and online to discuss the following points of the agenda: latest developments on the Electronic Communications Framework and other legislative initiatives at both European and national levels; good practices and experience in dealing with emerging security threats; emerging technologies and related initiatives. The Forum was opened by Evangelos Ouzounis, Head of the Policy Development and Implementation Unit of ENISA and by Warna Muzenbrock, chair of the ECASEC group. They both highlighted the challenges and opportunities of the new regulatory environment for the telecom sector. On behalf of the Greek mobile operators, George Stefanopoulos welcomed the participants and highlighted the challenges for operators during the pandemic and in view of the 5G rollout. The forum had three parts: a policy session about EU legislation, a technical session about ongoing cyber threats and a future networks session, with talks including topics such as 5G and edge computing. The Policy session: The Forum focused on the latest policy developments, the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) and the updated NIS Directive (NIS2) and how these affect the European telecom operators. The policy session started with an intervention from the European Commission presenting the NIS2 proposal and its implications for the telecom sector. Magnus Falk from ZOOM and Paolo Grassia from the European Telecommunications Network Association analysed the impact of the new legislation on telecom providers, both Number-Independent Interpersonal Communication Services providers and traditional ones. Finally, Kinga Pawlowska from a Polish media law firm discussed recent legislative proposals in Poland addressing the EECC and the NIS Directive.

ENISA_NEWS_0023	2021-10-15	NEWS	European Cybersecurity Month: Test your Skills with a Quiz	 The new ECSM Quiz goes live today. The game will guide players through mock adventures with IT, testing their skills on everyday online actions, such as replying to an email, which could have hidden traps. Everyone is welcome to play. After each quiz, players will learn about the risks and the traps to avoid. The aim of the quiz is to increase cyber hygiene among players, encouraging them to stay vigilant and #ThinkB4UClick. Take the ECSM Quiz The ‘Cyber First Aid’ theme running from today until 31 October, will introduce guidelines on how to deal with a cyberattack. Citizens will be able to access an interactive EU map to find local services they can contact and get advice from in case they fall victim of online shopping frauds, identity theft or social media hacks. In addition, they will also be able to register to interactive events on the ECSM platform and access videos and tips. Covering topics such as online shopping fraud and social media hacks, organisers will showcase first aid resources for the most common cyber threats. ‘Cyber First Aid’ will kick off with a video on the real life story of a small business owner who experienced a ransomware attack and came out on top ‘Cyber First Aid’ includes key advice for online users: #ThinkB4UClick: When receiving a message that appears to be from a social media provider, check the source of the email address first; Secure online accounts with a multi-factor authentication (MFA) and with strong, unique passwords; In the case of a cyberattack, immediately inform the social media provider(s) and report it to the relevant local authorities, find local resources using the interactive map; Never pay ransom to cyber criminals, as there is no guarantee they will give in and paying ransom only encourages them to continue their criminal activity towards others. Learn more about ‘Cyber First Aid’ and view the video at cybersecuritymonth.eu/cyber-first-aid-2021 This year’s ECSM campaign started with theme one, ‘Being Cyber Secure From Home’, which addressed the COVID-19-led increase in the use of digital technologies by promoting tips on how to remain cyber secure when communicating, working or studying online from home. During the first two weeks of October 2021, ECSM organisers and supporters introduced videos, infographics and events across Europe, and beyond – all about staying secure online in the home. Learn more about ‘Being Cyber Secure from Home’ at cybersecuritymonth.eu/be-cyber-secure-at-home About the European Cybersecurity Month (ECSM) The European Cybersecurity Month (ECSM) is the European Union’s annual campaign dedicated to promoting cybersecurity among citizens and organisations, and to providing up-to-date digital security information through awareness raising and the sharing of good practices. Each year, for the entire month of October, hundreds of activities take place across Europe, including conferences, workshops, trainings, webinars, presentations, online quizzes and more, to provide resources for citizens to learn more about protecting themselves online. The ECSM is coordinated by ENISA and supported by the European Commission, Europol, the European Central Bank and EU Member States, EFTA countries, and more than 300 partners (governments, universities, think tanks, NGOs, professional associations, private sector businesses) from Europe. The European Cybersecurity Month was first launched in 2012. The campaign is now part of the actions designed to implement the provisions of the EU Cybersecurity Act on awareness raising and education. The Act mandates the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) to organise regular outreach campaigns in cooperation with Member States, and EU Institutions, bodies, offices and other agencies. The ECSM is one of the areas in which ENISA assists Member States in their efforts to raise cybersecurity awareness and promote cybersecurity education across the Union. Get involved online The ECSM 2021 campaign continues with the same slogan used last year, ‘Think Before U Click!’ with hashtag #ThinkB4UClick. The general tagline, ‘Cybersecurity is a Shared Responsibility’ also still applies in 2021. Follow the ECSM campaign on Twitter @CyberSecMonth with hashtags #CyberSecMonth and #ThinkB4Uclick, and on Facebook @CyberSecMonthEU.

ENISA_PR_0024	2021-10-12	PR	Blue OLEx 2021 : Testing the  Response to Large Cyber Incidents	 The Blue OLEx exercise of 12th October was designed to test the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) of the EU CyCLONe at executive level in case of a large-scale cross-border cyber crisis or incident affecting EU citizens and businesses. Organised by the Romanian National Cyber Security Directorate with the support of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the event took place in Bucharest as well as online. Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar stated that “The Blue OLEx exercise is the opportunity for a practical assessment of and possible improvements to the standard operating processes to be followed in case of a cyber crisis. The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity supports EU Member States in their efforts to test and strengthen the efficiency of the procedures to be implemented should large-scale cross-border incidents occur.” Blue OLEx 2021: Key Takeaways This third edition of the table-top Blueprint Operational Level Exercise (Blue OLEx) marks the first anniversary of operation of the Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe). This is also the first year that the same scenario is tested at technical and operational levels: At the technical level with CySOPEx 2021, by the CSIRTs Network, the network of EU Member States’ appointed CSIRTs and CERT-EU established by the NIS Directive; At the operational level, where CyCLONE operates, with both CySOPex 2021, the exercise tailored for the CyCLONe Officers and; BlueOlex 2021 the exercise tailored for the high-level actors of national cybersecurity authorities. Role of the EU CyCLONe in Blue OLEx 2021 The Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe) is a cooperation network for Member States national authorities in charge of cyber crisis management to collaborate and develop timely information sharing and situational awareness based on tools and support provided by the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, which serves as the CyCLONe Secretariat. The objective of the CyCLONe’s is to contribute to the implementation of the European Commission's Blueprint for rapid emergency response in case of a large-scale cross-border cyber incident or crisis. The results of the Blue OLEx 2021 will therefore feed into developing and enhancing the standard operating procedures of the EU CyCLONe and help shape the future response to large-scale cross-border cyber incident or crisis in the EU. Objectives of the Blue OLEx 2021 The exercise tests the role of the high-level actors in the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) of the EU CyCLONe, and to: improve on situational awareness and information sharing processes based on results; develop roles and responsibilities of the CyCLONe both at high-level actors and officer’s levels; identify improvements and/or potential gaps in the standardised way of responding to incidents and crises (namely CyCLONe Standard Operating Procedures); enhance the relationship among the members of the cybersecurity high-level actors of national cybersecurity authorities of CyCLONe to strengthen coordination in case of large-scale cross-border cyber incident or crisis affecting EU citizens and businesses. Who was involved? The event gathered high level actors from the competent authorities in charge of cyber crisis management and/or cyber policy of 22 Member States. It also included the participation of the European Commission. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity participates both as exercise organiser and as the secretariat of the EU CyCLONe. The CyCLONe in a nutshell The EU CyCLONe was launched in 2020 during the 2nd edition of the BlueOLEx. The goals of EU CyCLONe are to: establish a network to enabling the cooperation of the appointed national agencies and authorities in charge of cyber crisis management; provide the missing link between the EU CSIRTs Network (technical level) and the EU political level. Considering the importance of the network within the EU cybersecurity landscape, the European Commission proposal for the revised NIS Directive includes a provision for the formal establishment of the European Cyber Crises Liaison Organisation Network (EU CyCLONe). The role of Romania in the EU CyCLONe initiative A first BLUE OLEx pilot-exercise was organised in Paris in 2019 following the initiative of France and Spain, respectively, within the NIS Cooperation Group. Romania strongly supported this initiative during the EU Presidency. This year, the execise is hosted by the recently established Romanian National Cyber Security Directorate. What is the role of ENISA in operational cooperation? By coordinating both the secretariat of the EU CyCLONe and the CSIRTs Network, ENISA means to synchronise the technical and operational levels and all actors involved in the EU to collaborate and respond to large-scale incidents and crises by providing the best tools and support by: Enabling operation and information exchange by resorting to infrastructure, tools and expertise; Acting as a facilitator (switchboard) between the different networks, the technical and operational communities as well as decision makers responsible for crisis management; Providing the infrastructure and support for exercises and training sessions. Background Blue OLEx is a high-level event organised each year by one Member State and supported by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, in collaboration with the European Commission. It aims to test the EU preparedness in the event of a cyber-related crisis affecting the EU Member States and to strengthen the cooperation between the national cybersecurity authorities, the European Commission and ENISA.

ENISA_PR_0025	2021-10-01	PR	Germany wins the European Cybersecurity Challenge	 The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) congratulates the winners of the competition ending today who have shown such passionate engagement. From 28th September to 1st October, the European Finals in Prague were supported by the Czech Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Education. The Director General of Directorate General for Informatics (DIGIT) at the European Commission Mr Mario Campolargo presented the awards to the winning teams: 1st place: Germany 2nd place: Poland 3rd place: Italy ENISA takes this opportunity to warmly thank the Czech Republic for their cooperation and support in hosting and organising the event. ENISA wishes to express its gratitude to all the community and experts who contributed to make the Challenge an even bigger and more engaging event every year. Juhan Lepassaar, EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director said: “The cybersecurity capacity of the Union heavily relies on a workforce adequate in size and equipped with the right knowledge and skills. The European Cybersecurity Challenge encourages cybersecurity careers and attracts the young talent needed tomorrow to ensure the continuity of the EU efforts dedicated to the cybersecurity of our digital space.” The event in a nutshell The event was the opportunity to gather 271 participants including 163 contestants supervised by the teams’ coaches and steering committee members, coming from 19 countries including EU Member States and EFTA countries. Participating countries included Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland. For the first time ever, the event featured the presence of Canada and Slovakia as guests and of Norway and Estonia as observers. European Cybersecurity Month The winners of the competition will now be designated as ambassadors for the European Cybersecurity Month https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/ campaign starting today. Selected members of the ECSC winning team will also be offered the possibility to experience a traineeship at ENISA. The European Cybersecurity Month campaign this year is organised around two themes: “Being Cyber Secure from Home” and “First Aid”. How were the competitors challenged? Participants had to solve security-related challenges from domains such as web and mobile security, crypto puzzles, reverse engineering, forensics to test their abilities and challenge their different cybersecurity-related skills in escape rooms. This year’s edition featured the introduction of a new activity to allow participants from different teams, hence from different nationalities, to work together on international cooperation. In 2022, ENISA will organise the first International Cybersecurity Challenge in Athens, Greece. More details on this competition will be published on ENISA website. #CyberBecause Launched on 7 September, the #CyberBecause campaign aims to promote cybersecurity careers and provide role models for young people. There is more to cybersecurity than simply hacking – and what’s more, anyone can forge a career in cybersecurity, regardless of background. The number of cybersecurity professionals needs to grow by 89% globally just to meet the current demand. Yet careers in cybersecurity are far more diverse than many people think. A cybersecurity career can take many avenues and can expand beyond technical skills whether IT, engineering, finance, law, communications, policy or any other fields. Using the #CyberBecause hashtag, we encourage all cybersecurity professionals to share their story of how they started their career and education. Let’s meet again next year! The 2022 edition of the European Cybersecurity Challenge will take place in Vienna, Austria. Stay tuned on the ECSC website. Background In a world, that is changing fast, young people hold the key to innovation. The ENISA European Cyber Security Challenge was born out of this philosophy to encourage young people to pursue a career in cybersecurity. The European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC) is an annual exercise, coordinated by the European Union Agency for cybersecurity. The event offers a platform for young cyber talents across Europe to gather and engage in networking over a unique opportunity to experience cooperation in trying to resolve a cybersecurity problem. The ECSC is intended to encourage young people to pursue a career in cybersecurity, by challenging and developing the participants’ skills needed in such extreme situations and connecting them with industry. Supported by the European Commission and EU Member States, the ECSC falls within the skills chapter of the EU Cyber Security Strategy for the Digital Decade and the NIS Directive.

ENISA_PR_0026	2021-09-30	PR	Uniting to raise awareness on Cyber Threats: European Cybersecurity Month 2021	     The annual cybersecurity awareness campaign is coordinated by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) and is supported by the European Commission, EU Member States, Europol, the European Central Bank, European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries and more than 300 partners from the public and private sector. The month-long campaign promotes up-to-date cybersecurity recommendations to build trust in online services and support citizens in protecting their personal, financial and professional data online. Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President for a Europe Fit for the Digital Age, said: “We will not use technology if we don’t trust it; and trust comes from feeling safe. That’s why cybersecurity is really central to our digitalisation, and to the use of technology. Especially nowadays when due to the pandemic we have been doing so many things online: working, learning, shopping, and more. By adopting good cybersecurity habits, we are building a safe and secure digital life.” European Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: “Cyber-attacks put at risk our businesses, our critical infrastructures, our data, the functioning of our democracies. Cyber criminals exploit the slightest vulnerability in our digital environment. The European Cybersecurity Month campaign aims at helping everyone acquire the necessary skills to shield ourselves and our way of life against cyber threats. The campaign’s motto “Think Before U Click” is especially this year more relevant than ever”. EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar said: “The European Cybersecurity Month campaign this year is bringing EU citizens the information to use in their everyday lives and provide tips to protect themselves from cybersecurity threats. We are uniting with Member States and EU institutions to advance awareness of these threats and to build a trusted and cyber secure Europe.” The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the importance of cybersecurity. Now, more than ever, education on digital security is key for citizens to identify risks and react effectively to cyber threats. Each year, for the entire month of October, the ECSM brings together EU citizens, Member States, the European Commission, EU bodies, and governmental organisations, the private sector and academia to promote healthy cybersecurity habits under the motto ‘Think Before U Click’. Online activities, including trainings, conferences, quizzes, presentations and national campaigns, across Europe, and beyond, are held to boost awareness of cybersecurity risks and share the up-to-date guidelines and ways to mitigate them. This year’s ESCM campaign will again address security issues surrounding the digitalisation of everyday life, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Encouraging people to ‘Think Before U Click’, the 2021 campaign presents two cybersecurity themes to help EU citizens recognise and prepare for cyber threats. The first theme centres around ‘Being Cyber Secure From Home’ by providing tips on how one can remain cyber secure when doing online transactions, communicating, working or studying online. Advice will be provided on good cyber hygiene for everyday practices online. The second theme provides ‘First Aid’ guidelines of what to do in case of a cyber incident. The goal of this theme is to encourage citizens to have a heightened awareness of the most common cyber threats and to provide advice on how to react in case one falls victim of online shopping frauds, when their credit card and/or bank account has been compromised and when their social media account has been hacked. Real-life stories of victims will be shared in the form of interviews and videos. The official website of the ECSM campaign is cybersecuritymonth.eu. The website acts as a ‘hub’ of cybersecurity information and includes a page to register activities related to awareness raising open to the public, and dedicated Member State campaign material in each local language (all 24 official EU languages are represented) as welll as the visual guidelines of the campaign for download. The ECSM also features a cybersecurity quiz for users to test their knowledge, and an interactive map of participating countries, giving information on services available in each country to report and get advice when one falls victim of a cyberattack.

ENISA_NEWS_0027	2021-09-22	NEWS	Moving forward in securing Online Trust via the Digital Wallets	 Electronic signatures, electronic seals and other online trust services have become a staple in the life of many Europeans. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, a key aspect to ensure a viable business model for qualified trust service providers was an increasing usage of online trusted services among European citizens, businesses and public administrations in an online mode.  This new reality across the EU has highlighted the security concerns of remote identification and authentication processes. The necessity for a new framework for EU digital identity became apparent. The European Commission presented last June a new framework for the EU digital identity by offering to citizens and businesses the digital wallets that will allow EU citizens to retain their documents such as national digital identities, licences, diplomas and bank credentials securely in their smartphone. The wallet should also allow them to log in to online services across the EU and to electronically sign their documents. On September 21st, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) in collaboration with the European Commission delivered the 7th consecutive ‘’Trust Service Forum’’. It attracted over to 1000 participants and brought more than forty experts, service providers, conformity assessment, supervisory bodies and national authorities together, to discuss the online trust market and its emerging issues under the European Commission’s Regulation 910/2014, on electronic identification and trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS Regulation). On 22nd September, D-TRUST in cooperation with TÜViT and the European School of Management and Technology (ESMT), held the 13th CA-Day. Both conferences were held in a hybrid format, with physical presence for the panellists at the ESMT premises in Berlin and virtually for the participants. The forum was jointly opened by the European Commission’s Director of Digital Society, Trust and Cybersecurity Ms. Lorena Boix Alonso and ENISA’s Head of Policy Development and Implementation Unit Mr. Evangelos Ouzounis and it was consisted of three main distinct blocks. In the first one, the panellists discussed the new ‘’EU Digital Identity Framework- bringing opportunity to wider use of online trust solutions across the EU’’. The concept of decentralised online identity, that gives back control to users over their personal data and leverages the use of an identity wallet, was additionally discussed. Second block focused on certification and standardisation efforts and the third one on the trust service market – current state of play, opportunities and outlook. Panellists had also the opportunity to further elaborate on the upcoming revisions of the eIDAS Regulation that proposes to further extend its application to the private sector and to promote trusted digital identities across the EU. Background The Trust Services Forum acts as a platform for participants to share their good practices on the implementation of trust services; review the standards, implementing acts and technical guidelines within the eIDAS; and discuss strategies to promote the adoption of qualified trust services. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity supports the Commission on the implementation of the eIDAS by providing security recommendations for the implementation of trust services, mapping technical and regulatory requirements, promoting the deployment of qualified trust services in Europe and raising awareness among users on securing their e-transactions. Under the EU Cybersecurity Act of 2019, the Agency gained an extended mandate to explore the area of electronic identification (eIDs) included in the regulation. EU's Digital Wallet's proposal The Commission on the 3rd June 2021 proposed a framework for a European Digital Identity which will be available to all EU citizens, residents, and businesses in the EU. Citizens will be able to prove their identity and share electronic documents from their European Digital Identity wallets with the click of a button on their phone. They will be able to access online services with their national digital identification, which will be recognised throughout Europe. Large platforms are proposed to accept the use of European Digital Identity wallets upon request of the user, for example to prove their age. Use of the European Digital Identity wallet will always be at the choice of the user. The new European Digital Identity Wallets will enable all Europeans to access services online without having to use private identification methods or unnecessarily sharing personal data. With this solution they will have full control of the data they share.

ENISA_NEWS_0029	2021-09-13	NEWS	Risky business or a leap of faith? A risk based approach to optimise cybersecurity certification	 The Methodology for Sectoral Cybersecurity Assessments (SCSA Methodology) in a nutshell The Methodology for a Sectoral Cybersecurity Assessment - (SCSA Methodology) was developed to enable the preparation of EU cybersecurity certification schemes for sectoral ICT infrastructures and ecosystems. SCSA aims at market acceptance of cybersecurity certification deployments and supports the requirements of market stakeholders and the EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA). In particular, SCSA endorses the identification of security and certification requirements based on risks associated with the “intended use” of the specific ICT products, services and processes. The SCSA Methodology makes available to the ENISA stakeholders a comprehensive ICT security assessment instrument that includes all aspects pertinent to sectoral ICT systems and provides thorough content for the implementation of ICT security and cybersecurity certification. While SCSA draws from widely accepted standards, in particular ISO/IEC 27000-series and ISO/IEC 15408-series, the proposed enhancements tackle multi-stakeholder systems and the specific security and assurance level requirements concerning ICT products, processes and cybersecurity certification schemes. This is achieved by introducing the following features and capabilities: Business processes, roles of sectoral stakeholders and business objectives are documented at ecosystem level, overarching the ICT subsystems of the individual stakeholders. Stakeholders are invited to actively contribute to the identification and rating of ICT security risks that could affect their business objectives. A dedicated method associates the stakeholders’ ratings of risks with the security and assurance level requirements to dedicated ICT subsystems, components or processes of the sectoral ICT system. SCSA specifies a consistent approach to implement security and assurance levels across all parts of the sectoral ICT system and provides all information required by the sectoral cybersecurity certification schemes. Benefits of the SCSA Methodology for stakeholders The sectoral cybersecurity security assessment provides a comprehensive approach of the multi-faceted aspects presented by complex multi-stakeholder ICT systems and it features the following benefits: The security of a sectoral system requires synchronisation across all participating stakeholders. SCSA introduces comparability of security and assurance levels between different stakeholders’ systems and system components. SCSA enables building open multi-stakeholder ecosystems even among competitors to the benefit of suppliers and customers. The risk-based approach supports transparency and a sound balance between the cost for security and certification and the benefit of mitigating ICT-security-related business risks for each concerned stakeholder. Security measures can focus on the critical components, optimising the security architecture of the sectoral system, hence minimising cost of security. SCSA generates accurate and consistent information on security and certification level requirements for all relevant ICT subsystems, components or processes. On this basis, suppliers can match their products to their customers’ requirements. SCSA supports the integration of existing risk management tools and information security management systems (ISMS). Due to a consistent definition of assurance levels, the re-use of certificates from other cybersecurity certification schemes is supported. Target audience - Who is it meant for? SCSA aims at an expert level audience, in particular ICT experts, ICT security experts and decision-makers in charge of sectoral multi-stakeholder systems, as well as suppliers.

ENISA_NEWS_0030	2021-09-08	NEWS	New Tool is another step towards securing the Digital Future of SMEs	 According to the European Commission’s data, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) constitute 99% of all businesses in the EU and employ around 100 million people. In order to overcome the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic many SMEs applied new business continuity measures and turned to new technologies such as adopting to cloud services, upgrading their internet services, improving their websites, and enabling staff to work remotely. Although SMEs have turned to new technologies, they often fail to raise the level of their security, mainly due to the lack of funding and cybersecurity guidelines. The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity is providing continuous support to SMEs. In doing so the “SecureSME” Tool has been created as a means to raise awareness and help SMEs become digitally secure. The “SecureSME’’ tool is a one-stop shop for European SMEs, which provides related cybersecurity recommendations, guidelines and tips in a simplistic and user friendly manner. The goal of the tool is to support those businesses in securing their ICT services and infrastructure from cyberattacks and ensure business continuity. The tool will be presented and become directly accessible to the public on the 8th September 2021, within the framework of the International Cybersecurity Forum (FIC 2021) in Lille, France. ENISA is an active participant to the fair dedicated to public and private cybersecurity operators, by running an awareness campaign dedicated to SMEs. What is the “SecureSME” Tool? Cybersecurity doesn’t necessarily have to be costly for SMEs to implement and maintain. There are several measures that can be implemented, without having to invest a large amount. ENISA’s ‘’SecureSME Tool’’ is a dedicated platform designed to support small and medium size businesses in their efforts to become digitally secure. This is achieved through the provision of practical and concise cyber tips and guidelines on how to secure ICT infrastructure. The “SecureSME’’ tool presents the following main sections of particular interest to SMEs: Cyber tips that include instructions on how to: Protect Employees Enhance Processes Strengthen technical measures Overcome Covid19 issues Videos Guidelines in relation to SME cybersecurity published by ENISA and Member States’ National Authorities EU H2020 related projects Background “SecureSME’’ tool comes as the next step following the publication of the “Cybersecurity for SMEs” report by ENISA last June. The report provides SMEs with advice on how to successfully cope with cybersecurity challenges, particularly those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the report, ENISA also published a short cybersecurity guide in the form of a leaflet: “12 steps to securing your business”, which provides SMEs with practical high-level actions to better secure their systems and hence their businesses. The short cybersecurity guide, which is also accessible via the “SecureSME” Tool, is now translated in the following languages:  Czech, German, Greek, Spanish, French, Italian, Latvian, Polish, Portuguese and Romanian.

ENISA_NEWS_0031	2021-09-07	NEWS	Prague hosts a meeting of the best European talents in cybersecurity	 This year's ECSC will be held in Prague for the first time since its inception and will take place from 28 September until 1 October 2021. The competition will be attended by 200 competing national teams players under the age of 25, winners of national cybersecurity competitions from the individual European countries and Canada. The teams will test their strengths in penetration testing, cryptography, reverse engineering, forensic analysis, and other challenging tasks. The ECSC is not just a competition, the aim of this annual activity is to actively address the global problem of the lack of IT professionals and cybersecurity in general. The competition aims to motivate young people to work in IT and to popularise the issue of cybersecurity. The month of October is the European Cybersecurity Month that aims to advance awareness of cybersecurity and build trust in online services. #CyberBecause Today, we launch the #CyberBecause campaign to promote the cybersecurity careers and provide role models for young people. There is more to cybersecurity than simply hacking – and what’s more, anyone can forge a career in cybersecurity, no matter what their background is. The number of cybersecurity professionals needs to grow by 89% globally just to meet current demand. Yet careers in cybersecurity are far more diverse than many people think. A cybersecurity career can take you down many paths, whether your experience lies in IT, engineering, finance, law, communications, policy and much much more. Using the #CyberBecause hashtag, we encourage all cybersecurity professionals to share their story of how they started their career and education. ECSC 2021 This year, the organisation of competition tasks was prepared by the winning team of the national competition of the Czech Republic, in cooperation with professionals from the Czech Republic and ENISA. The set-up of the entire competition as a sci-fi story taking place in the distant future where the competitors in a role of cyber experts need to defend the space colonisation expedition from hacker attacks. The introductory short story was written for ECSC 2021 by the Czech science fiction writer Jan Kotouč, the author of novels from the science fiction genre and alternative history. The European Finals in Prague will be sponsored by the Czech Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Education. Mario Campolargo, Director General of DG Informatics (DIGIT) at the European Commission will present the awards to the winning teams. Without the support and help of all partners, it would not be possible to carry out such an extensive and significant activity. Further Information On 29 September, a press conference will be held in Prague to provide further information on the European Cybersecurity Challenge. During the Challenge, a conference will also take place on the topic of ‘Does the human brain stand a chance?’ For more information about the competition, please visit the web pages www.ecsc.eu and www.ecsc2021.cz For more information on the #CyberBecause and to explore our community stories, check out https://ecsc.eu/about/cyberbecause Contacts Erika Pupišová as the ECSC 2021 main coordinator  M: 731 475 547 | E: erika.pupisova@ecsc2021.cz Adrian Belmonte as the ENISA coordinator for the ECSC M: +306985173256| E: adrian.belmonte@enisa.europa.eu Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0034	2021-07-29	PR	Understanding the increase in Supply Chain Security Attacks	 Supply chain attacks have been a concern for cybersecurity experts for many years because the chain reaction triggered by one attack on a single supplier can compromise a network of providers. Malware is the attack technique that attackers resort to in 62% of attacks. According to the new ENISA report - Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks, which analysed 24 recent attacks, strong security protection is no longer enough for organisations when attackers have already shifted their attention to suppliers. This is evidenced by the increasing impact of these attacks such as downtime of systems, monetary loss and reputational damage. Supply chain attacks are now expected to multiply by 4 in 2021 compared to last year. Such new trend stresses the need for policymakers and the cybersecurity community to act now. This is why novel protective measures to prevent and respond to potential supply chain attacks in the future while mitigating their impact need to be introduced urgently. Juhan Lepassaar, EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director said: “Due to the cascading effect of supply chain attacks, threat actors can cause widespread damage affecting businesses and their customers all at once. With good practices and coordinated actions at EU level, Member States will be able to reach a similar level of capabilities raising the common level of cybersecurity in the EU.” What is a supply chain? A supply chain is the combination of the ecosystem of resources needed to design, manufacture and distribute a product. In cybersecurity, a supply chain includes hardware and software, cloud or local storage and distribution mechanisms. Why is a good level of cybersecurity not good enough? Composed of an attack on one or more suppliers with a later attack on the final target, namely the customer, supply chain attacks may take months to succeed. In many instances, such an attack may even go undetected for a long time. Similarly to Advanced Persistence Threat (APT) attacks, supply chain attacks are usually targeted, quite complex and costly with attackers probably planning them well in advance. All such aspects reveal the degree of sophistication of the adversaries and the persistence in seeking to succeed. The report reveals that an organisation could be vulnerable to a supply chain attack even when its own defences are quite good. The attackers explore new potential highways to infiltrate organisations by targeting their suppliers. Moreover, with the almost limitless potential of the impact of supply chain attacks on numerous customers, these types of attacks are becoming increasingly common. In order to compromise the targeted customers, attackers focused on the suppliers’ code in about 66% of the reported incidents. This shows that organisations should focus their efforts on validating third-party code and software before using them to ensure these were not tampered with or manipulated. For about 58% of the supply chain incidents analysed, the customer assets targeted were predominantly customer data, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data and intellectual property. For 66% of the supply chain attacks analysed, suppliers did not know, or failed to report on how they were compromised. However, less than 9% of the customers compromised through supply chain attacks did not know how the attacks occurred. This highlights the gap in terms of maturity in cybersecurity incident reporting between suppliers and end-users. The recommendations, in a nutshell: Apply good practices and engage in coordinated actions at EU level. The impact of attacks on suppliers may have far reaching consequences because of the increased interdependencies and complexities of the techniques used. Beyond the damages on affected organisations and third parties, there is a deeper cause for concern when classified information is exfiltrated and national security is at stake or when consequences of a geopolitical nature could emerge as a result. In this complex environment for supply chains, establishing good practices and getting involved in coordinated actions at EU level are both important to support all Member States in developing similar capabilities – to reach a common level of security. The report issues an extensive number of recommendations for customers to manage the supply chain cybersecurity risk and to manage the relationship with the suppliers. Recommendations for customers include: identifying and documenting suppliers and service providers; defining risk criteria for different types of suppliers and services such as supplier & customer dependencies, critical software dependencies, single points of failure; monitoring of supply chain risks and threats; managing suppliers over the whole lifecycle of a product or service, including procedures to handle end-of-life products or components; classifying of assets and information shared with or accessible to suppliers, and defining relevant procedures for accessing and handling them. The report also suggests possible actions to ensure that the development of products and services complies with security practices. Suppliers are advised to implement good practices for vulnerability and patch management for instance. Recommendations for suppliers include: ensuring that the infrastructure used to design, develop, manufacture, and deliver products, components and services follows cybersecurity practices; implementing a product development, maintenance and support process that is consistent with commonly accepted product development processes; monitoring of security vulnerabilities reported by internal and external sources that includes used third-party components; maintaining an inventory of assets that includes patch-relevant information.  Download the Threat Landscape for Supply Chain Attacks Background The cyber threat landscape is constantly evolving. Both policy makers and practitioners need to have access to up-to-date and accurate information on the current threat landscape, supported by threat intelligence. To respond to this need, the ENISA Threat Landscape has been published on an annual basis since 2012. These reports are based on publicly available data and provides an independent view on observed threats, threat agents, threat trends and attack vectors. ENISA set up an Ad-Hoc Working Group on Cyber Threat Landscapes in order to interact with a broad range of stakeholders and to receive advice in designing, updating and reviewing the methodology needed to draw cyber threat landscapes, including the annual ENISA Threat Landscape.  The Agency provides threat analysis on a range of emerging technologies and challenges including recent threat landscapes on Artificial Intelligence and 5G. On the issue of supply chain attacks, ENISA released the Supply Chain Integrity Report in 2012 (and updated in 2015) which identifies the nature of these threats and examines the possible strategies to counter them.

ENISA_PR_0035	2021-07-26	PR	Telecom & Trust Services Incidents in 2020: System Failures on the Rise	 Incident reporting is the invaluable tool used across the EU for the notification of significant cybersecurity incidents, their impact assessment and the evaluation of trends. The national regulatory authorities (NRAs) of each EU Member State provide a summary of these incidents to the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA on a yearly basis but also on an ad-hoc basis. The two reports published today provide an extensive analysis on incident root causes, the impact of incidents that occurred in 2020 and assesses multiannual trends. Juhan Lepassaar, EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director said: “Incident reporting allows to make projections and to continually maintain a view over the cyber threat landscape. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity is dedicated to support national authorities and the wider cybersecurity community to ensure coherence, coordination and efficiency in incident reporting and analysis.” EU-wide agreed thresholds apply in how incidents are selected although Member States have the right to deviate at national level. Such reports therefore only provide information related to incidents reported by Member states. However, as thresholds can change over the years, ENISA takes precautionary measures to perform the analysis of trends in a coherent and informed way. Why is incident reporting important? The major objective of telecom services and trust services incident reporting is to help national authorities with their supervision tasks, to map cybersecurity trends as well crosscutting issues and sector weaknesses. Aggregating this information is important to understand gaps and to identify and address emerging issues. ENISA has been supporting the EU telecom security authorities since 2011 and the supervisory bodies for EU trust services since 2016 on the respective incident reporting. The role of ENISA is to develop procedures, information gathering templates and data processing tools in relation to these incidents and to publish a report every year on the previous year’s incidents. What are the key takeaways of the reports on 2020 incidents? Telecom Security Incidents 2020 - Annual Report The annual report on telecom security incidents for 2020 reveals that faulty software changes and/or updates constitute a major aggravating factor in terms of impact resulting in 346 million hours lost which is equivalent to 40 % of the total number of hours lost. System failures continue to dominate as the most frequent cause of incidents leading to severe adverse impact. The total of incidents caused by human errors or third-party failures remain similar to the levels seen in 2019. The multiannual trends show that although system failures continue to be the most frequent cause of incidents (61%), these incidents are decreasing in size. The analysis also reveals that incidents cause by human errors have been on the increase between 2016 and 2020, reaching 26% of the total number of incidents. Trust Services Security Incidents 2020 - Annual Report The annual report on trust services incidents also reveals system failures remain the dominant root cause of incidents with human errors ranking second. Overall, the level of severity remains steadily low, which indicates that Trust Service Providers (TSPs) report more incidents, even those that are less severe. In 2020, 69% of total incidents had an impact on qualified trust services when compared with approximately 33% of incidents reported on non-qualified trust services. The study highlights a concern over non-qualified trust services incidents considered to be under reported although such services are very widely used. A good example of this is website certificates used by 80 % of websites globally. The rather limited number of incident reports on non-qualified trust services under the eIDAS regulation suggests there is still under-reporting in the specific market. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that one Member State reported 11 incidents during 2020. Besides, the analysis also revealed PDF sign-in vulnerabilities with the emerging of new “shadow attacks” affecting a wide range of software products. The information collected and analysed in the telecom and trust services security incident reports is stored on CIRAS, an online visual tool that allows the analysis of incidents and can be used to generate custom graphs. ENISA is considering issuing a consolidated report in 2022. More reporting activities are expected in the future with the revision of the NIS directive. Event – Trust Services Forum 2021 Together with the European Commission, ENISA will organise the Trust Service Forum on 21st September 2021. This edition takes place for the 7th year in 2021 following its inception in 2015. Collocated with D-TRUST/TUVIT CA Day on 22 September 2021, the event is to take place in Berlin, Germany, provided that the travelling and gathering controls allow for this. More information: Trust Services Forum - CA Day 2021 Background information On electronic communications, providers in the EU have to notify telecom security incidents having significant impact to the national authorities for telecom security in their country. At the beginning of every calendar year, the authorities send summary reports about these incidents to the EU Agency for Cybersecurity. Established in 2010, the European Competent Authorities for Secure Electronic Communications expert group (ECASEC), or former Article 13a group, consists of about 100 experts from national telecom security authorities from EU Member States, European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and European Economic Area (EEA) countries, as well as EU candidate countries. Electronic trust services include a range of electronic services around digital signatures, digital certificates, electronic seals, timestamps, etc. used to secure electronic, online, transactions. The eIDAS regulation is the EU wide legal framework meant to ensure the interoperability and security of the electronic trust services across the EU. One of the goals of the eIDAS is to ensure electronic transactions can have the same legal validity as traditional paper - based transactions, to create a framework in which a digital signature has the same value as a hand-written signature. Security is an important pillar of the overall framework. Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation requires trust service providers in the EU to assess risks, take appropriate security measures, and mitigate security breaches.

ENISA_NEWS_0036	2021-07-16	NEWS	Remote Identity Proofing: How to spot the Fake from the Real?	 What is identity proofing? Traditionally, proofing an individual’s identity consists in physically providing evidence of an individual’s identity, by presenting a government issued ID. Remote identify proofing methods are a way to identify individuals, without relying on physical presence. Remote identity proofing has received a lot of attention recently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Remote identity proofing is usually done over a webcam or a customer’s mobile phone, where the customers show themselves along with their government issued document – an identity card or passport. ENISA will soon publish a report focusing on remote face presentation attacks, where someone attempts to impersonate someone else, or create a fake identity. Remote identity proofing can be used in a variety of contexts where trust in the identity of a natural or legal person is essential – such as financial services, e commerce, travel industry, human resources, matching platforms (including delivery and ride-hailing services), public administrations, online gambling and many other sectors. Why a workshop on remote identity proofing attacks? With the remote identity proofing methods used today in the EU, you can remotely create a bank account or obtain a qualified electronic signature and sign legal documents. However, resorting to these solutions make it necessary to understand and analyse the different possible attacks. The workshop presented and discussed technologically enhanced deluding attacks and explored the countermeasures, to finally peek into the future and anticipate challenges to come. The workshop was also intended to validate the analysis and key elements of the upcoming report “Remote Identity Proofing Practices: Attack Scenarios” which ENISA expects to publish in October. What did the workshop focus on? The first part of the workshop was dedicated to the threat landscape and included a presentation of the desktop research results and preliminary findings. The attack scenarios explored consisted of: deepfake video injection; high-quality 3D silicone masks; video manipulation of an identity document. Participants were also asked to identify a deepfake participant hidden among workshop panellists. The second part focused on the emerging threats and the future of spoofs. Each part included a question and answer session to allow for an interactive discussion between participants and panellists. Nowadays, most of remote ID attacks are low tech, with attackers presenting fake IDs or presenting someone else’s face on a display (so-called replay attack). However, deepfake attacks are expected to become more frequent and harder to detect. As a consequence, countermeasures will need to evolve as well. Both active (i.e. asking the user to read random set of numbers) and passive (i.e. face texture analysis) security controls will play their role in the future, and synergies between AI and human operators will need to be further developed in order to spot the fakes. With over 180 participants, the interactive sessions made it an engaging and positively received workshop. Who was the workshop intended for? Industry – EU companies and other public or academic organisations with a focus on EU remote identity technology providers; National governments and other relevant public bodies, academia and other interested parties; Trust service providers and identity providers; Conformity assessment bodies and supervisory bodies; Security researchers and the wider security community. Background Electronic identification under the eIDAS regulation constitutes a digital solution designed to provide proof of identity for citizens or organisations, in order to access online services or perform online transactions. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity has been at the forefront of the developments in the eIDAS regulation since 2013. The Agency has been supporting the Commission and the Member States in the area of trust services in many ways, including but without being limited to the following: security recommendations for the implementation of trust services; mapping technical and regulatory requirements; promoting the deployment of qualified trust services across Europe; raising awareness for relying parties and end-users. The EU Cybersecurity Act of 2019 strengthened the Agency’s role is supporting the implementation of eIDAS.  The European Digital Identity is intended to be available to all EU citizens, residents and businesses in order to identify themselves or provide confirmation of personal information. Its purpose is to facilitate access to public and private digital services across the European Union. Last year ENISA mapped the full landscape of remote identity proofing methods and countermeasures in a report publish in March of this year: The Agency continues to engage in such work which is expected to develop in the future. Event announcement – save the date for the Trust Services Forum 2021 Together with the European Commission, ENISA will organise the Trust Service Forum on 21st September 2021. This edition takes place for the 7th year in 2021 following its inception in 2015. Collocated with D-TRUST/TUVIT CA Day on 22 September 2021, the event is to take place in Berlin, Germany, provided that the current travelling and gathering restrictions will be lifted by then.

ENISA_PR_0037	2021-06-28	PR	Phishing most common Cyber Incident faced by SMEs	 Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are considered to be the backbone of Europe's economy. 25 millions of SMEs are active today in the European Union and employ more than 100 million workers. The report Cybersecurity for SMEs ENISA issues today provides advice for SMEs to successfully cope with cybersecurity challenges, particularly those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. With the current crisis, traditional businesses had to resort to technologies such as QR codes or contactless payments they had never used before. Although SMEs have turned to such new technologies to maintain their business, they often failed to increase their security in relation to these new systems. Research and real-life experience show that well prepared organisations deal with cyber incidents in a much more efficient way than those failing to plan or lacking the capabilities they need to address cyber threats correctly. Juhan Lepassaar, EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director said: “SMEs cybersecurity and support is at the forefront of the EU’s cybersecurity strategy for the digital decade and the Agency is fully dedicated to support the SME community in improving their resilience to successfully transform digitally.” In addition to the report, ENISA also publishes today the Cybersecurity Guide for SMEs: “12 steps to securing your business”. The short cybersecurity guide provides SMEs with practical high-level actions to better secure their systems, hence their businesses.   Based on an extended desktop research, an extensive survey and targeted interviews, the report identifies those pre-existing cybersecurity challenges worsened by the impact of the pandemic crisis. Key findings 85% of the SMEs surveyed agree that cybersecurity issues would have a serious detrimental impact on their businesses with 57% saying they would most likely go out of business. Out of almost 250 SMEs surveyed, 36% reported that they had experienced an incident in the last 5 years. Nonetheless, cyberattacks are still not considered as a major risk for a large number of SMEs and a belief remains that cyber incidents are only targeting larger organisations. However, the study reveals that phishing attacks are among the most common cyber incidents SMEs are likely to be exposed to, in addition to ransomware attacks, stolen laptops, and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) frauds. For instance, with the concerns induced by the pandemic, cyber criminals seek to compromise accounts using phishing emails with Covid-19 as a subject. CEO frauds are other decoys meant to lure an employee into acting upon the instructions of a fraudulent email displayed as if sent from their CEO, and usually requesting a payment to be performed in urgency under business-like circumstances. The report unveils the following challenges SMEs are faced with: Low awareness of cyber threats; Inadequate protection for critical and sensitive information; Lack of budget to cover costs incurred for implementing cybersecurity measures; Availability of ICT cybersecurity expertise and personnel; Absence of suitable guidelines tailored to the SMEs sector; Moving online; Low management support. How to address those challenges? The recommendations issued fall into three categories: People People play an essential role in the cybersecurity ecosystem. The report draws attention to the importance of responsibility, employee buy-in and awareness, cybersecurity training and cybersecurity policies as well as third party management in relation to confidential and/or sensitive information. Processes Monitoring internal business processes include performing audits, incident planning and response, passwords, software patches and data protection. Technical At the technical level, a number of aspects should be considered in relation to network security, anti-virus, encryption, security monitoring, physical security and the securing of backups. Target audience The report intends to deliver actionable guidance to the owners and employees of SMEs. In addition, this work can be of use to other entities involved in the SME ecosystem, such as SMEs national and European associations, policymakers and implementers, SME ICT providers and others. Background For nearly 15 years, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity has been pushing forward cybersecurity initiatives to assist SMEs to integrate cybersecurity into their digital environments. Starting in 2006 and 2007, the Agency published two Information Package for SMEs reports, providing risk assessment and management methodologies for SMEs. In 2010, the Agency published the Business Continuity for SMEs report to help facilitate IT knowledge transfer to SMEs. In 2015, the Cloud Security Guide for SMEs report was released to assist SMEs understand the security risks and opportunities regarding cloud services. Two years later, the Agency published the Guidelines for SMEs on the security of personal data processing. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity released last year a series of tips to help businesses face the rapidly changing digital sphere during the pandemic: Tips for selecting and using online communication tools; Tips for cybersecurity when buying and selling online; Tips for cybersecurity when working from home; Top ten cyber hygiene tips for SMEs during covid-19 pandemic. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity and the National Cyber Security Alliance published a joint checklist for SME in November 2020, offering businesses on both sides of the Atlantic a basic guide to maintaining digital security.

ENISA_PR_0038	2021-06-23	PR	EU Boost against cyberattacks: EU Agency for Cybersecurity welcomes proposal for the Joint Cyber Unit	" The concept of the Joint Cyber Unit (JCU), suggested two years ago by European Commission President von der Leyen, is an important step towards completing the European cybersecurity crisis management framework. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) welcomes the proposal for the Commission Recommendation to build a Joint Cyber Unit and the role it is foreseen to play. The Cybersecurity Act mandates the Agency to cooperate at the operational level and establish synergies with Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. The JCU helps the Agency to achieve this in a structural manner. The support the EU Agency for Cybersecurity would provide to building a Joint Cyber Unit comes as a reinforcement of the provisions set out in the Cybersecurity Act, which has widened the scope of the activities of the Agency. This new initiative is an important step on how the Agency can further contribute to achieve a higher common level of cybersecurity within the European Union. Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President for a Europe Fit for the Digital Age, said: ""Cybersecurity is a cornerstone of a digital and connected Europe. And in today’s society, responding to threats in a coordinated manner is paramount. The Joint Cyber Unit will contribute to that goal. Together we can really make a difference.” Margaritis Schinas, Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life, said: ""The recent ransomware attacks should serve as a warning that we must protect ourselves against threats that could undermine our security and our European Way of Life. Today, we can no longer distinguish between online and offline threats. We need to pool all our resources to defeat cyber risks and enhance our operational capacity. Building a trusted and secure digital world, based on our values, requires commitment from all, including law enforcement.” Thierry Breton, Commissioner for the Internal Market, said: ""Today we have put in place an ambitious building block in protecting ourselves from cyber threats that are evolving rapidly and are becoming more complex. We have set clear milestones and timelines that will allow us to concretely improve crisis management cooperation in the EU. The Joint4 Cyber Unit leverages the expertise that is scattered across Europe and will enable us to not only detect threats but also react faster.” Juhan Lepassaar, EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director said: “The EU Agency for Cybersecurity is committed to support the Union and its Member States in the response to cyberattacks. The Joint Cyber Unit will build stronger relationships within the cybersecurity ecosystem and shape an effective framework for crisis management. Our future local office in Brussels will operate closely with the Unit to coordinate response, create situational awareness and ensure preparedness in times of crisis.” Cybersecurity Ecosystem Infographic EU Agency for Cybersecurity office in Brussels While the Agency’s headquarters remain in Athens, a bridge-head has become important to coordinate activities such as operational cooperation and incident response. By establishing this local office in Belgium, ENISA’s work will be further strengthened as a Brussels base will facilitate the implementation of the operational cooperation activities foreseen by the Cybersecurity Act. ENISA is dedicated to ensure that its seat in Greece will remain and expand in the coming years. Today, the European Commission gave their consent to the establishment of an ENISA office in Brussels while the Management Board of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity had already provided their prior consent. The Agency also received the positive opinion of the Hellenic and Belgian authorities. The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity will serve as secretariat for the preparatory phase of the JCU. Therefore, the Unit will be physically located next to the new Brussels office of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity and the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU institutions, bodies and agencies (CERT-EU). The Joint Cyber Unit and the role of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity The Joint Cyber Unit is considered as a concrete deliverable of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy and the EU Security Union Strategy to contribute to a secure digital economy and society. It aims to connect a number of cybersecurity communities using a common space designed to foster cooperation and allow existing networks to realise their full potential. EU Agency for Cybersecurity’s role in operational cooperation The role of ENISA is to support operational cooperation among Member States, Union Institutions, Bodies, Offices and Agencies. ENISA is mandated to ensure that an effective cooperation framework is in place among the operational actors within the Union in case of large-scale cross-border cyberattacks and crises. By coordinating both the secretariat of the EU CyCLONe and the CSIRTs Network, ENISA aims at synchronising the technical and operational levels and all actors involved in the EU to collaborate and respond to large-scale incidents and crises by providing the best tools and support.

ENISA_NEWS_0039	2021-06-22	NEWS	How to Help National Authorities deal with the Challenges of Mobile Networks Security?	 The series of educational webinars on mobile networks security topics was organised in collaboration with OTE Academy. These webinars, scheduled over the month of June covered the three generations of mobile networks, namely 3G, 4G and 5G and also addressed the migration from these generations to 5G. Why a webinar series on mobile network security? Further development of specialised knowledge on mobile networks security is considered even more necessary and relevant today in light of the wider 5G rollout in Europe. Besides, investigating the related challenges and addressing the capabilities in this area has become increasingly pressing now that the European Electronic and Communications Code (known as the EECC) needs to be implemented and transposed into national laws. What did the webinars focus on? The webinars focused on four different topics, as follows: Basic security concepts for 3G, 4G and 5G The participants received focused training sessions on architecture, interfaces and a high-level security framework for all three generations of mobile networks.  Signalling Security Topics covered included the protection of signalling over the air interface, the transport network and signalling interconnection security. Security considerations for migrations from 3G/4G to 5G The participants examined scenarios of migration from 3G/4G to 5G, security vulnerabilities and mitigation controls in 3G, 4G and 5G. Security risks and mitigation controls for Non-Standalone (NSA) 5G deployment In addition, the training encompassed 5G core network and virtualisation techniques, as well as cloud security risks and mitigation controls. Topics extensively explored included the security vulnerabilities of Non-Standalone (NSA) 5G deployments and the relevant security framework and procedures. Target audience More than 70 experts from the 5G cybersecurity work stream of the NIS Cooperation Group and those of the European Competent Authorities for Secure Electronic Communications Expert Group (ECASEC EG, former Article 13a EG) formed the participants who engaged in the webinars. ENISA plans further knowledge building activities for its stakeholders foreseen to take place during the 3rd quarter of 2021.  About ENISA’s knowledge building webinars These webinars are part of a broader series of knowledge building seminars that ENISA organises for national authorities in the EU on new technologies and the cybersecurity opportunities and risks associated with them. Previous seminars for national authorities covered topics such as cloud security, internet backbone security and applications of cryptography. The overarching goal of this initiative is continuous knowledge building on technology topics and related security challenges meant to implement the Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade of the EU.

ENISA_PR_0040	2021-06-18	PR	Pandemic urges strong measures to address risks on the security of personal data  	" Privacy goes hand in hand with security. This is what is aimed to be achieved with the EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy of December 2020. A harmonised approach in security and data protection is also evident to the recent proposal on European Digital Identity and the EU Regulation for Digital COVID-19 Certificates, which aim to ensure a high level of both cybersecurity and data protection. Juhan Lepassaar, EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director said: “The pandemic and recent technological innovations such as 5G and AI have highlighted the importance of a “by design” approach, for both security and data protection. The Annual Privacy Forum provides the opportunity for the different actors to enhance this approach together.” Lorena Boix Alonso, Director for Digital Society, Trust and Cybersecurity in the European Commission’s Directorate General for Communications Networks Content and Technology (DG CONNECT) said: ‘The COVID crisis has demonstrated the usefulness of electronic communications metadata in the fight against the pandemic. Therefore, clear and updated rules will help us to use these data in an even more optimal manner in order to protect European citizens. This trust environment will unlock the potential for our digital society with innovative solutions for the future.’ Aleid Wolfsen, European Data Protection Board Deputy Chair said: ""The EDPB is committed to supporting the co-legislators and be a part of ongoing discussions, especially in those areas where the rights to privacy and protection of personal data are important factors.” Wojciech Wiewiórowski, European Data Protection Supervisor stated “The world is watching us, Europe, on how we will frame the rules for Artificial Intelligence. The race to AI shall not justify cutting corners on the framing of the legal framework. We want it to be fair for people, and to bring additional protection, not any less to what is right in EU from a fundamental rights perspective.” Among 800 participants, policymakers, data protection practitioners, researchers, industry representatives and the wider privacy community connected online to discuss current privacy and data protection issues and emerging challenges on securing personal data. Key highlights of the conference This year’s APF welcomed keynote speeches from the Director of Directorate CNECT H, Digital Society, Trust and Cybersecurity, Lorena Boix Alonso, the European Data Protection Supervisor Wojciech Wiewiórowski, the Deputy Chair of the European Data Protection Board, Aleid Wolfsen and the General Director of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, Bjørn Erik Thon. On day one, researchers presented their work on implementing data protection principles and promoting compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The European Commission presented the EU Digital Principles initiative, which is part of the Commission’s vision for Europe’s digital transformation by 2030 and the European Fundamental Rights Agency presented the Agency’s work on Artificial Intelligence and fundamental rights. Later in the day, ENISA moderated a panel discussion on the security considerations of personal data in the “new” normality, discussing how the aftermath of the pandemic and new technologies such as AI could affect personal data processing.  Further to legal provisions, protection can also be achieved by deploying correctly appropriate security measures, such as pseudonymisation and encryption. On day two, a panel discussion on the draft ePrivacy Regulation took place with interventions from the European Parliament rapporteur MEP Birgit Sippel, Ursula Pachl from European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) and Antonio Muñez from the telecommunications sector (Telefónica). The discussion focused on the importance and relevance of the ePrivacy Regulation for the protection of confidentiality of communications and the processing of electronic communications metadata and its use in the fight against the pandemic. The ePrivacy Regulation will modernise the current rules and will enhance the protection of our citizens' rights to their privacy and confidentiality of communications. Researchers presented their work on Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) and the Norwegian Consumer Council discussed the traction between consumers and the online advertising industry. The final panel discussion was moderated by the European Data Protection Board where the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, the European Data Protection Supervisor and ENISA discussed how to engineer data protection principles into practical guidelines for developers. Conclusions As European Union we should continue to put forward and adopt legislative initiatives, such as ePrivacy Regulation, NIS2, AI, Digital Identity and DORA that promote a high level of protection and respect fundamental rights and freedoms. Similar to the recent legislative initiatives on AI and Digital Identity, we must provide assurance to the end-user not only on the level of cybersecurity but also on whether their personal data are being processed according to legal provisions. Security and data protection are two sides of the same coin. To achieve this, respect for fundamental rights is essential. This is why we need to develop the appropriate legal and policy framework. After the GDPR's recent third anniversary, it is now high time to progress with the ePrivacy Regulation that will complete the legislative framework. Implementation is another important challenge. There is no need though to start from scratch. We have to use available techniques and technologies, incorporate security and privacy by design and default into new products and services and adopt security measures proportional to the level of risk presented.

ENISA_NEWS_0041	2021-06-17	NEWS	EU Telecom Security Authorities discuss the challenges of Over-the-top Communications Services Supervision	 The 34th meeting of the ECASEC expert group mainly focused on the challenges and open issues of the supervision of the Number-Independent Interpersonal Communication Services (NI-ICS) under the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC). NI-ICS, also referred to as over-the-top communication services (OTTs), are a new set of services in scope of the EU telecom legislation. Over-the-top communications services enable direct interpersonal and interactive exchange of information via electronic communications, without connecting to the public telephone network. Highlights of the 34th meeting The meeting engaged in a discussion on the supervision of the NI-ICS, with the intention to explore how the related provisions of the new EECC could be addressed. The supervision of the NI-ICS as provided for by the EECC is challenging as NI-ICS providers do not operate in a single country but usually offer services across all 27 Member States. The group highlighted the challenges this presents in supervising the NI-ICS. Specifically, the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) discussed the harmonised incident reporting obligations in relation to the NI-ICS. They also exchanged their views on the need for cross-border NI-ICS supervision. In addition, the group followed a presentation on BEREC’s report on harmonised metrics of regulatory relevance for NI-ICS. The Regulatory Authority of Cyprus presented the new tool they developed in order to support the supervision of cybersecurity in critical sectors.  Also, the Danish Authority introduced their consolidated incident-reporting platform and the Netherlands presented their auditing mechanisms. In addition, the group discussed the recent developments in relation to the request ENISA received from the European Commission to prepare a new candidate certification scheme for 5G. Further topics addressed included the following projects of ENISA for 2021 on: 5G Security Controls Matrix; Webinars on mobile network security; ENISA reports to be published by the end of the year on Network Function Virtualisation (NVF) techniques, SIM swapping and Consumer Outreach Strategies. ENISA informed the Group about its situational awareness activities, such as the Open Cyber Situational Awareness Machine (openCSAM). Next steps The Group is expected to meet again in October in a hybrid format. The meeting foreseen will include the organisation of a separate open session, where providers will also be invited. About the meeting More than 50 experts from national authorities supervising the European telecom sector in the EU, EFTA, EEA, and EU candidate countries attended the meeting held on 16th and 17th June. Background on ECASEC Expert Group, formerly known as the ENISA Article 13a group Established in 2010, the ENISA ECASEC expert group, formerly known as the ENISA Article 13a group, consists of about 100 experts from national telecom security authorities from EU Member States, EFTA countries, and EU candidate countries. The group is a forum for exchanging information and good practices on telecom security. It produces policy guidelines for European authorities on the implementation of EU telecom security legislation, and publishes an annual summary report about major telecom security incidents. This group meets 3 times a year in order to discuss and agree on a common approach to telecom security supervision in the EU.

ENISA_NEWS_0042	2021-06-07	NEWS	Calling on you, 5G Experts! Join us on 5G Cybersecurity Certification	 The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity received earlier this year the request from the European Commission to prepare a new candidate certification scheme on 5G. The call launched today is intended to set up an ad hoc working group on 5G cybersecurity certification meant to support the Agency for the purpose of preparing the new EU 5G certification scheme. What are the specific requirements of the call? The call for expression of interest will establish an ad hoc working group (AHWG) to support the preparation of the EU 5G scheme, and is intended to: meet the CSA requirements, ensuring consistency with other schemes of the EU cybersecurity certification framework and is expected to explore the possibility to re-use the EU Common Criteria and EU Cloud Services schemes or parts thereof; fit seamlessly with the suite of solutions for 5G security created by the NIS cooperation group (EU coordinated risk assessment, 5G threat landscape and the5G toolbox). How does the call fit into the preparation programme of the EU 5G scheme? The programme for the preparation of the EU 5G scheme consists of 2 phases. Phase one intends to achieve the “as-is” translation of elements composing existing schemes into their EU equivalents. Phase two foresees the adding of enhancements and improvements designed to meet the EU cybersecurity requirements, which will eventually lead to the final drafting of the certification scheme. This call concerns phase 1 with the option to either extend phase 1 or launch a new call for phase 2 of the AHWG. The decision on phase 2 will largely be defined by the results of the gap analysis, to be concluded at the end of phase 1. In phase 1, the work of the AHWG will be subdivided into 3 work streams focusing on: “As-is” translation of existing scheme elements into an EU-equivalent of the GSMA NESAS scheme “As-is” translation of existing scheme elements into an EU-equivalent of the GSMA SAS-SM and SAS-UP schemes and GSMA’s eUICC certification scheme Risk-based definition of security and certification requirements for components that support the before mentioned use cases and gap analysis Each work stream requires different skillsets, competences and expertise of individual 5G stakeholder representations. Terms of reference Download the Terms of Reference from the dedicated page - Ad-Hoc Working Group on 5G Cybersecurity Certification Deadline for applications The call will remain open until 7h July 2021 at 12:00 EET (Athens time zone). Background Adopted in 2019, the Cybersecurity Act established the European Cybersecurity Certification Framework that allows creating market-driven EU certification schemes and helps reduce fragmentation between existing cyber certification schemes. This framework will deliver certification schemes recognised in all Member States, making it easier for businesses to trade across borders and for users to understand the security features of the product or service. More information on the EU's actions including for the 5G toolbox, is available on this page.

ENISA_NEWS_0043	2021-06-03	NEWS	New Light Shed on Capabilities in Energy & Healthcare	 Sectoral CSIRTs and PSIRTs in a nutshell Europeans can count on more than 500 Computer Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and on the CSIRTs network to respond to cybersecurity incidents and attacks. In addition to CSIRTs, Product Security Incident Response Teams (PSIRTs) have emerged more recently. Their role is to manage the vulnerabilities of a company’s products and services. PSIRTs have been mostly developed in a heterogeneous way. For instance, while some of them are well developed and independent from the main Incident Response (IR) team of the host company, others belong to their Security Operations Centre (SOC) or are just part of the development team. Why a report on CSIRTs and PSIRTs capabilities? The Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NISD) adopted in 2016 provides legal measures to boost the level of cybersecurity in the EU. Both CSIRTs and PSIRTs are essential players in the global Incident Response (IR) ecosystem. The study published today - PSIRT Expertise and Capabilities Development - provides recommendations on the role of PSIRTs in the IR setup of the Member States according to the NISD, specifically in the energy and health sectors. ENISA had already explored in details the IR setup across all sectors of the NISD in a study published in 2019: “EU Member States incident response development status report”. Sectoral PSIRTs as energy or healthcare ones may benefit from an aligned approach in terms of processes and collaboration to ensure legal compliance in relation to their business partners, clients and possibly Operators of Essential Services or other actors subject to EU cybersecurity regulation. Target audience Based on an extensive desk research and a survey addressed to 7 PSIRTs and 22 CSIRTs from 19 Member States, the report identifies 12 findings and discloses 9 recommendations addressed to: Sectoral PSIRTs; Sectoral CSIRTs; Operators of Essential Services (OES); Security Operations Centres. What are the key findings & key recommendations? The recommendations issued are based on an in-depth analysis of the following elements: Organisation, processes & tools; Collaboration; Development & visibility. The study highlights the following major challenges and related recommendations: Develop a clearer role and visibility of PSIRTs The exact role of PSIRTs or their specific activities are not always clear. Recommendations consist in developing communications with clients and encouraging stronger engagement with the Incident Reporting community through conferences and working groups. The development of standardised documents based on partner expectations in relation to PSIRT policies, procedures and services offered could help improve the understanding of the services, the visibility of the PSIRT team and facilitate the vulnerability reporting process. Improve cooperation among PSIRTs Challenges are identified in relation to effective cooperation among the different stakeholders of the vulnerability ecosystem such as PSIRTs, CSIRTs, national and/or sectoral CSIRTs, end clients and OES. Recommendations include the development of technical standards to improve interoperability, automation and processes in order to streamline the exchange of sensitive information. This would especially make sense in order to meet the requirement of early notification in case of vulnerability disclosure. Find out about the other challenges and recommendations issued in the report published today. Download the Report How can ENISA help? Generally, both emerging and established PSIRTs consider it necessary for ENISA to develop best practices, standards and harmonised certifications that PSIRTs could rely on to improve their efficiency. Recommended actions include the publication of guidelines and general security guidance. At a more global level, the development of a high-level cooperation framework would help develop best practices and also facilitate exchanges among the different PSIRTs and other IR teams within the EU.

ENISA_NEWS_0044	2021-05-27	NEWS	Can Digital Identity Solutions Benefit from Blockchain Technology?	 What is blockchain technology used for? Blockchain technology was first introduced as a technology for digital currencies, but recently new application areas are emerging. There are proposals to use blockchain technology for electronic voting and secure sharing of medical data. Besides, there is now a booming market of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) underpinned by blockchain technology. A new field, which could also benefit from blockchain technology is digital identities. Resorting to blockchain-based digital identity frameworks would allow users greater control over their identity data, and at the same time offer a resilient and decentralised system without single points of failure. Who was the seminar intended for? Organised by the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) in collaboration with the Delft Blockchain Lab of the Dutch Delft University of Technology, the knowledge building seminar held today was intended for national authorities overseeing the trust services market and for authorities involved with digital identity schemes. This seminar was organised in the context of ENISA’s support of the ENISA Article 19 Expert Group, a working group of national authorities supervising the trust service providers in the EU.   What did the seminar focus on? The seminar introduced the basic concept of blockchain technology, and explored its application in the area of trust services and electronic identification, making a comparison with traditional centralised hierarchical ones in terms of user control and single points of failure. The focus here was on advantages and disadvantages, potential abuse and misuse, potential impact on society and the economy as well as the issue of governance.  The seminar concluded with an overview of several existing initiatives, such as the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI), Sovrin, and the TU Delft Trustchain. It also included an overview of real-life scenarios, such as controlling access to a construction site and the confirmation of diplomas by a university.  About ENISA’s knowledge building seminars This seminar is part of a broader series of knowledge building seminars that ENISA organises for national authorities in the EU on new technologies and the cybersecurity opportunities and risks associated with them.

ENISA_NEWS_0045	2021-05-26	NEWS	Crossing a bridge: the first EU cybersecurity certification scheme is availed to the Commission 	 In July 2019, the EUCC was the first candidate cybersecurity certification Scheme request received by the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) under the Cybersecurity Act. This scheme aims to serve as a successor to the currently existing schemes operating under the SOGIS MRA (Senior Officials Group Information Systems Security Mutual Recognition Agreement). It covers the certification of ICT products, using the Common Criteria ISO/IEC 15408 and is the foundation of a European Cybersecurity certification framework. The latter will consist of several schemes that it is expected to gradually increase trust in ICT products, services and processes certified under these schemes and reduce the costs within the Digital Single Market. ENISA has developed it with the support of an Ad Hoc Working Group composed of outstanding cybersecurity certification experts, and members of the European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG), that is composed of representatives of the EU Member States. This scheme was originally published on 1 July 2020 and it was put for consultation which allowed certification actors and interested parties to provide their feedback through a dedicated survey. The results of this public consultation and the revised scheme can be downloaded from the following links: ENISA Report - Public Consultation on the draft Candidate EUCC Scheme Cybersecurity Certification: Candidate EUCC Scheme V1.1.1 Key points of the public consultation outcome Confirms the intent of certification stakeholders to use the scheme in the internal market, when it is made available; stakeholders encourage ENISA to further develop guidance to support the implementation and execution of the scheme; stakeholders indicated some elements of the scheme that needed to be adjusted or fixed, such as conditions or timelines for the maintenance of certificates, the monitoring and handling of non-compliances or vulnerabilities. Key recommendations to ENISA Further to the candidate scheme ENISA has supported the EU cybersecurity certification framework to: Develop a communications plan targeting consumers to support the implementation of the EUCC scheme and ensure they are well informed in what cybersecurity certification of ICT products entails; Ease the participation of interested EU Member States newcomers to cybersecurity certification to participate to the EUCC scheme by providing a dedicated training programme; Establish a transition project in order to provide and ensure the best conditions for a smooth transfer from the current national SOG-IS activities to the current EUCC. The Agency has currently transmitted the candidate EUCC scheme v.1.1.1 to the Commission in line with the provisions of Article 49 (6, 7) of Regulation (EU) 2019/881 (Cybersecurity Act). The Commission will initiate a Commission Implementing Regulation that may be adopted. ENISA has advanced in the development of a second candidate scheme, related to cloud services. This EU Cloud Services cybersecurity certification scheme was in its first draft published for public consultation at the end of December 2020. Documents related to public consultation of the candidate Cloud Services scheme are available on the page dedicated to Public Consultations on Cybersecurity Candidate Schemes. Furthermore, ENISA is about to launch the call for an AHWG for the preparation of an EU cybersecurity certification scheme on 5G soon.

ENISA_PR_0046	2021-05-19	PR	EU Member States test rapid Cyber Crisis Management	" CySOPEx 2021 is the first EU exercise for the recently established EU CyCLONe - Cyber Crises Liaison Organisation Network. The Network’s liaisons link the technical level (ie. The CSIRTs Network) to the political one when a large-scale cross-border cyber crisis takes place. This is in order to support the coordinated management of such cybersecurity incidents and crises at operational level and to ensure the regular exchange of information among Member States and Union institutions, bodies and agencies. The CySOPex exercise aims to test Member States procedures for fast cyber crisis management in the EU when facing large-scale, cross-border cyber incidents and crisis. All Member States and the European Commission are taking part in the exercise organised by Portugal as Presidency of the Council of the European Union and CyCLONe Chair and by the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) that acts as the secretariat of the CyCLONe. The procedures which are tested aim to enable swift information exchange and effective cooperation among the Cyber Crises Liaison Organisations (CyCLO) – i.e. the Member States  competent authorities – within the CyCLONe along the lines described as the operational level of the Blueprint recommendation. CyCLONe Chair and representative of the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the EU João Alves said: “CySOPex 2021 is an important milestone for the CyCLONe network, bringing together Member States, ENISA and European Commission to better prepare and coordinate rapid response procedures in case of a large-scale cross-border cyber incident or crisis. Recent events have shown the importance of such cooperation and aligned response. CySOPex reflects everyone’s engagement in the present and, foremost, in the future.” EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar said: “Enabling the coordination of all the actors involved at operational, technical and political levels is an important element of efficient response to cross-border cybersecurity incidents. Testing these capabilities is a sine qua non to prepare for the future cyber-attacks."" Specifically, the CySOPex exercise is tailored for the CyCLONe officers who are specialised in crisis management and/or international relations supporting the decision-makers, prior to and during, large-scale incident or crisis situations. They provide guidance on situational awareness, crisis management coordination and political decision-making.   The goals of the exercise are to increase the overall competences of the CyCLONe officers specifically to: train on situational awareness and information sharing processes; improve understanding of roles and responsibilities in the context of the CyCLONe; identify improvements and/or potential gaps in the standardised way of responding to incidents and crises (i.e. Standard Operating Procedures); test the CyCLONe cooperation tools and exercise infrastructures provided by ENISA. This exercise follows the BlueOlex 2020, where the CyCLONe was launched. BlueOlex is a table-top Blueprint Operational Level Exercise (Blue OLEx) for high-level executives of national cybersecurity authorities. Upcoming Events This year, the CySOPEx 2021 will be followed by the CyberSOPex 2021, the exercise for the technical level embodied by the CSIRTs Network and the BlueOlex 2021 that will take place in Q4. About CyCLONe – the EU Cyber Crises Liaison Organisation Network EU CyCLONe aims at enabling rapid cyber crisis management coordination in case of a large-scale cross-border cyber incident or crisis in the EU by providing timely information sharing and situational awareness amongst competent authorities and is supported by ENISA, which provides the secretariat and tools.   EU CyCLONe operates at the “operational level”, which is the intermediate in between technical and strategic/political levels. The goals of EU CyCLONe are to: establish a network to enabling the cooperation of the appointed national agencies and authorities in charge of cyber crisis management; provide the missing link between the EU CSIRTs Network (technical level) and the EU political level.   Due to its importance in the EU cybersecurity landscape, the European Commission proposal for the revised NIS Directive envisions in Article 14 the formal establishment of the European Cyber Crises Liaison Organisation Network (EU – CyCLONe). About ENISA role in operational cooperation By coordinating both the secretariat of the EU CyCLONe and the CSIRTs Network, ENISA aims at synchronising the technical and operational levels and all actors involved in the EU to collaborate and respond to large-scale incidents and crises by providing the best tools and support by: Enabling operation and information exchange with infrastructure, tools and expertise;    Acting as facilitator (switchboard) between the different networks, the technical and operational communities as well as decision makers responsible for crisis management; Providing the infrastructure and support for the exercise and training.

ENISA_NEWS_0047	2021-05-10	NEWS	Capture-The-Flag Competitions: all you ever wanted to know!	 The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity releases a report addressing the contemporary use of Capture-The-Flag (CTF) competitions around the world. It explores how these competitions work and provides a high-level analysis of the dataset of the most recent major public events. Based on the results of the findings, the report suggests recommendations for consideration in the design phase of these types of competitions. The study comes as a complement to the Capture-the-flag events co-organised for the past five years by ENISA and the European Commission such as the European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC). Download the Report CTF competitions: what are they? Capture-the-Flag events are computer security competitions. Participants compete in security-themed challenges for the purpose of obtaining the highest score. Competitors are expected to “capture flags” to increase their score, hence the name of the event. Flags are usually random strings embedded in the challenges. CTFs have increased in popularity as they attract a higher number of young talents each year. They help develop the essential skills required to follow a career path in cybersecurity. These competitions can take many forms but the most common are Jeopardy and Attack-Defence. The report specifically focuses on these two types of CTF. An explanation and analysis is developed for each of them on the format, scoring, discussion and variants. Findings: what kind of analysis and methodology was used? The themes used to qualitatively analyse CTF events were chosen with the objective to provide readers with sufficient information about all aspects of organising a CTF event. This analysis, therefore, explores the following elements of the competition in details: entry requirements: consolidates data on age, status, qualifications, location, etc.; diversity and inclusion: gender balance, socio-economic background of or ethnic proportionate representation, etc.; challenge format: explores challenge categories, scoring, platform used, prizes, length of the competition, etc.; competition format: analyses information on team sizes, mentors and coaches, qualifiers or parallel contests; event organisation: looks at other activities organised such as catering and transport or accommodation facilities provided; post-event actions: explores actions performed after the event such as challenge and solution distribution, the release of result data or subsequent publications. What are the main recommendations Recommendations are provided in relation to the themes and areas explored. Formats for instance should be chosen according to the audience the competition is designed for. The accessibility and lower deployment costs of the Jeopardy format make it more suitable for non-professional participants. The Attack-Defence however, being more similar to wargame formats, is better suited to professional training exercises. The report includes recommendations covering the following areas: Team requirements; Team sizes; Scoring and rules; Parallel competitions; Challenge formats; Communication and media; Post-event. Who is the report intended for? The report on CTF Events will be of particular interest to all individuals and organisations who are involved in the design of CTF competitions. It will also help participants and organisations who intend to promote such events to find valuable information on how such events are structured and made functional. Upcoming event ENISA will be organising the first International Cybersecurity Challenge. Security Union Vice-President Margaritis Schinas announced the preselection of players for Team EU on the occasion of his visit to ENISA on 6th May. Background The European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC) is an annual exercise, coordinated by the European Union Agency for cybersecurity. The event offers a platform for young cyber talents across Europe to gather and engage in networking over a unique opportunity to experience cooperation in trying to resolve a cybersecurity problem. The ECSC is intended to encourage young people to pursue a career in cybersecurity, by challenging and developing the participants’ skills needed in such extreme situations and connecting them with industry. Supported by the European Commission and EU Member States, the ECSC falls within the skills chapter of the EU Cyber Security Strategy for the Digital Decade and the NIS Directive.

ENISA_PR_0048	2021-05-06	PR	First visit of Security Union Vice-President Margaritis Schinas to ENISA and announcement of ‘Team EU’ for the first Cyber World Cup	 The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) today welcomes the European Commission Vice-President for Promoting the European Way of Life including the EU Security Union, Margaritis Schinas to its headquarters in Athens. During the visit, the Vice-President met with Agency staff members and discussed how the Agency contributes to the security of the EU. Building capacities refers to activities that increase the preparedness to recognise and respond to cybersecurity incidents, which requires investment in cyber skills and competences. “ENISA has been placed at the centre of our EU Security Union Strategy as cybersecurity remains a priority given the continuous and increasing challenges that we face in this area. This is why this Commission has proposed to step up even further our defences and protect our critical infrastructures through legislative proposals. To implement this high level norms, we will need competence and knowledge – this will require addressing the massive skills shortage in the EU through offering of education and skills. The young people selected to represent the EU at the first International Cybersecurity Challenge will be part of the solution and our future workforce and hope that the EU can continue to excel in cybersecurity”, said European Commission Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life Margaritis Schinas.  “The shortage of cybersecurity professionals is a problem that Europe cannot afford to ignore. Building the cybersecurity skillset to deal with the future cyber threats means we need to invest in the workforce of tomorrow. The International Cybersecurity Challenge will support Member States in training their young people while fostering a global exchange of expertise. ” said EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar. Since 2015, ENISA has been coordinating the European Cybersecurity Challenge, an annual competition where cyber teams from across the EU and EEA countries compete against each other. It aims to encourage young people to pursue a career in cybersecurity while enhancing their abilities. Building on the success of the European Challenge, ENISA has engaged with regional and international organisations from North and South America, South/East Asia, Oceania and Africa to organise a first International Cybersecurity Challenge. A selection of European players will make up the first ‘Team EU’ to compete in this first Cyber World Cup, in an effort to enhance international collaboration in cybersecurity. In the first International Cybersecurity Challenge, teams from across the globe will compete in a series of challenges such as web application and system exploitation, cryptography, reverse engineering, hardware challenges, forensics and escape rooms. The Preselection of Team EU The preselection of the players for Team EU has been finalised and includes 36 young people (aged 18-26) representing 17 countries. The team currently consists of representatives from Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Switzerland. The members of Team EU already undergo online training. This will be complemented with two training events, the first one taking place in July in Estonia will consist of lectures, training sessions, competitions as well as team building activities. After a training stage, a selection of the 15 members of Team EU (and 5 backups) will be made in October. Cybersecurity Competitions Aside from promoting cybersecurity skills and education, ENISA is involved in creating and supporting cyber competitions targeting young people. The European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC) is an annual competition that will be hosted in Prague, Czechia in 2021. The number of cybersecurity competitions continues to grow across Europe, but such trainings and events are a necessary measure if we aim to tackle the cybersecurity skills gap and cybersecurity workforce shortage. The Agency recently published a report outlining the key success factors to run effective national cybersecurity competitions: Towards a common European Cybersecurity Challenge roadmap. ENISA will soon release a new report addressing the use of Capture-The-Flag (CTF) competitions around the world. These computer security competitions, which have increased in popularity as they attract a higher number of young talents each year, help develop the essential skills required to follow a career path in cybersecurity.

ENISA_NEWS_0049	2021-05-05	NEWS	How to Secure the Connected & Automated Mobility (CAM) Ecosystem	 The Connected and Automated Mobility sector in a nutshell Today, connected vehicles, environments and infrastructures need to be designed with new capabilities and features. These capabilities and features should aim to provide: increased safety; better vehicle performance; competitive digital products and services; improved comfort; environmental friendliness; user-friendly systems and equipment convenient for its customers. The Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM) sector is a whole ecosystem of services, operations and infrastructures formed by a wide variety of actors and stakeholders. This ecosystem not only generates transformation in the industries but also considers how to meet the needs of the citizens. It is therefore intended to ensure transportation is made safer and easier. In addition, it also needs to align with the EU efforts towards cleaner, cheaper and healthier forms of private and public transport. The recommendations proposed by ENISA aim to guide all CAM stakeholders in today’s context of growing cybersecurity threats and concerns. In order to aggregate the information presented in the new report released today, ENISA performed surveys, interviews and an extensive desktop research of official statistics. The subsequent findings were validated through discussions with key stakeholders from the CAM sector. The recommendations issued contribute to the improvement and harmonisation of cybersecurity in the CAM ecosystem in the European Union.  ENISA Report – Recommendations for the Security of Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM) New policy initiatives: what do we need to know? Under a new regulation set by the United Nations, car manufacturers are required to secure vehicles against cyberattacks. With the upcoming transposition of the United Nations' regulations into EU policy, the new regulation on cybersecurity will be mandatory in the European Union for all new vehicle types from July 2022 and will become mandatory for all new vehicles produced, regardless of the type, from July 2024. It is important to remember that the UNECE Regulations and related ISO standards do not apply to all CAM stakeholders. The types of vehicles the regulation applies to include passenger cars, vans, trucks and buses, light four-wheeler vehicles if equipped with automated driving functionalities from level 3 onwards. Target audience The report is intended to support the work of the European Commission and the EU Member States’ competent authorities in the transposition of the UN cybersecurity regulation into EU policy. Decision-makers who are responsible for the protection of security and resilience of the CAM ecosystem at EU level will find in the report the relevant cybersecurity measures and key challenges they need to consider to draft their cybersecurity baseline. The report is also expected to be of particular interest to Operators of Intelligent Transport Systems (OITS), Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), Road Authorities (RA), Smart City Operators, system providers, mobility service providers and standardisation bodies among others. Which challenges does the report identify? The report published today provides recommendations for each challenge identified, such as: Governance and cybersecurity integration into corporate activity Cybersecurity governance in the CAM ecosystem represents an organisational and technical challenge for all stakeholders concerned. Recommendations given include: promote the integration of cybersecurity along with digital transformation at the board level in the organisation; promote procurement processes to integrate cybersecurity risk-oriented requirements. Technical complexity in the CAM ecosystem Dependencies, interactions and supply chain management in this sector are a well-known challenge acknowledged by the majority of the actors involved. Recommendations given include: promote the use of suitable certification schemes; promote security assessment for both on-board and off-board solutions and standardise the discovery and remediation of vulnerabilities during the lifetime of the product. Lack of expertise and skilled resources for CAM cybersecurity The lack of human resources with expertise in cybersecurity on the market is a major obstacle that hinders the adoption of security measures specific to CAM products and solutions. encourage cross-functional security and safety knowledge exchange between IT/OT and mobility experts respectively; introduce programmes at schools and universities to address the lack of security and safety knowledge across the industry. Such challenges are only an example of the important challenges addressed in the ENISA Report – Recommendations for the Security of Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM). Further information ENISA is already engaged in the cybersecurity of smart cars and intelligent transport systems and issued publications of existing standardisation, legislative and policy initiatives, as well as good practices and security measures to ensure the security of smart cars against cyber threats.

ENISA_NEWS_0050	2021-04-23	NEWS	Exploring Research Directions in Cybersecurity 	 Resilience, technological sovereignty and leadership are essential for the EU and as such, they are addressed by the new EU Cybersecurity Strategy. In an effort to support this cybersecurity strategy, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity releases today a report intended to look into digital strategic autonomy in the EU and suggests future research directions. What is Digital Strategic Autonomy? Digital strategic autonomy can be defined as the ability of Europe to source products and services designed to meet the EU’s specific needs and values, while avoiding being subject to the influence of the outside world. In the digital world, such needs may encompass hardware, software or algorithms, manufactured as products and/or services, which should comply with the EU values, and thus preserve a fair digital ecosystem while respecting privacy and digital rights. To ensure the sourcing of such products and/or services complies with the EU’s needs and values, the EU has the option to self-produce them autonomously, or in the case where products and services are acquired from third countries, to certify them and validate their compliance. However, in cases where there is a high dependence on sourcing, the EU should still be capable of operating its digital infrastructures without giving rise to any possible detrimental influence. Hence, Europe needs to maintain the capability to produce its critical products and services independently. In short, digital strategic autonomy means the capacity for the EU to remain autonomous in specific areas of society where digital technologies are used. Why such a move? The new challenges brought about by the digitalisation of our environment raise questions on our capacity to retain ownership and control of our personal data, of our technological assets and of our political stand. Such are the main dimensions to be considered under the idea of digital strategic autonomy. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of cybersecurity and the need for the EU to continue to invest in research & development in the digital sector. Within this context, ENISA’s report sets and prioritises the key research and innovation directions in cybersecurity. Key Research Directions: which are they? The report identifies the following seven key research areas: Data security; Trustworthy software platforms; Cyber threat management and response; Trustworthy hardware platforms; Cryptography; User-centric security practices and tools; Digital communication security. For each of these areas, the report introduces the current state-of-play in the EU, includes an assessment of current and expected issues. The analyses included serve the purpose of issuing recommendations on cybersecurity related research topics. Such recommendations intend to highlight the bases needed to bolster the EU’s digital autonomy. Who is the report intended for? Policymakers: the report provides objective-driven strategic guidance on future projects and investments in cybersecurity and can be used for the development of industrial and research policies; Researchers: the analysis of the areas presented could serve as a guide to address the current research and technological challenges and help to re-assess priorities accordingly.

ENISA_NEWS_0051	2021-04-15	NEWS	European Cybersecurity Month:  265% Increase in Social Media Mentions	 The report published today shows how the European Cybersecurity Month campaign is getting wider attention with citizens engaging in online activities at a rate higher than ever before.  With social media engagement growing 265% of what it was in 2019, the campaign is getting momentum achieving its mission of reaching out to the European citizens to enhance education and awareness on cybersecurity. In addition, the ECSM campaign website was extensively consulted with a total of 117.072 visits in 2020.  ENISA closely coordinated this 8th edition of the campaign with the following supporting and participating partners: Cybersecurity organisations from the participating Member States and EFTA Countries; European Commission;   Europol’s Cyber Crime Centre (EC3);  European Schoolnet;  Erasmus Student Network;   Internet Youth Governance Forum. The participating Member States based their campaign on the following founding idea:  ''Cybersecurity is a Shared Responsibility'' Member States decided to address both security and privacy topics. In doing so, they intended to help EU citizens develop a basic understanding of the different online security measures they can implement and provide them with key information on privacy issues. Such topics were addressed under two themes: digital skills and cyber scams.   The official motto of the 2020 campaign was therefore:  ''Think Before U Click'' Member States coordinators agreed to support the implementation of the campaign’s activities. The broader objectives of the Cybersecurity Month are:  To promote cyber hygiene best practices; To highlight existing recommendations;  To act as a “hub” for all participating Member States;  To increase the participation of EU Member States and relevant stakeholders.  The ENISA - ECSM Deployment Report 2020 reveals the increased impact of the 2020 campaign and the positive outcomes of the activities performed.  Content & Highlights  The report includes information on planning and execution as well as the evaluation of the campaign.  The 2020 campaign was fully conducted online due to the Covid-19 circumstances. It focused on the delivery of additional audio-visual material and of a rich social media events calendar. Consequently, ENISA invested in developing digital content for online dissemination and launched an improved campaign website to engage with the public.  The pages of the European Cybersecurity Month’s website were also considerably visited during the campaign. The new ECSM website had 117.072 views, which means 14.127 more views in 2020 than in 2019. This is the highest growth in comparison to growth between 2017-2018 and 2018-2019.  The EU Member States coordinators agreed to organise the event around two themes: Digital skills - The purpose was to provide information on e-privacy matters such as personal data protection, privacy and cyberstalking;  Cyber scams - Addressing cyberscams allowed to share insights into the current and potential cyberthreats such as phishing, business email compromise and online shopping frauds.  The 2020 campaign saw a significant increase in the following:  Social media engagement: threefold increase in 2020 compared to 2019, from 14.842 to 43.900;  Social Media Reach: from 3,5 million in 2019 to 8,8 million in 2020;  Social Mentions: from 1.928 in 2019 to 7.046 in 2020; social media shares almost tripled;  Member States’ participation: an additional 6 Member States joined and 1 EFTA country actively engaged in last year’s campaign compared to the year before;  Twitter activities: retweets doubled compared to 2019;  Total number of post appearances for digital media assets rose from 2,7 million in 2019 to 9,8 million in 2020 (threefold increase). The survey questionnaire sent to the Member States coordinators revealed how well the organisation of the ECSM was perceived. It also showed that the ECSM is considered to add substantial value to the national campaigns by 91% of the participating EU Member States. Overall, the campaign is seen as a practical and positive opportunity to improve cooperation with other Member States.  The 2021 Campaign  The ECSM 2021 will focus on two themes: ‘Be cyber secure at home’ and ‘First aid’, giving guidance to end-users on what to do when they fall victims of online fraud and identity theft.  Background  The European Cybersecurity Month is an EU awareness-raising campaign on cybersecurity intended for EU citizens. It is organised yearly by ENISA together with the European Commission and the participating Member States.  This awareness campaign is part of the actions designed to implement the provisions of the Cybersecurity Act (CSA) that mandate ENISA to organise regular outreach campaigns in cooperation with Member States, Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.  It is within this context that ENISA assists Member States in their efforts to raise cybersecurity awareness and promote cybersecurity education throughout the Union.  Further information  ENISA – ECSM Deployment Report 2020  ECSM website ECSM dedicated ENISA website's section Contact: For questions related to the press and interviews, please contact press(at)enisa.europa.eu   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0052	2021-04-12	NEWS	6 Key Success Factors to run Effective National Cybersecurity Competitions	 The success of cybersecurity competitions: why does it matter? In light of today’s cybersecurity threats, the global cybersecurity workforce would need to grow by 89% for organisations to defend their critical information and communications technology (ICT) assets effectively. In order to address this critical situation, national governments started to implement a number of programmes and policies to increase the number of professionals available on the labour market. National cybersecurity competitions (NCSCs) such as capture-the-flag (CTF) events gathering teams of students have been some of the most widespread tools used to address the shortage. Besides, several national cybersecurity competitions now take place worldwide including in Asian, English-speaking and European countries. The European Union’s competition is the European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC). The pan-European event is organised once a year by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA). The objective of the competition is to improve and increase cybersecurity talent in Europe and connect high potential individuals with industry-leading organisations. This high level objective may be ‘transposed’ to a number of sub-objectives, such as: identify young cybersecurity talent; increase interest in cybersecurity as a topic; increase cybersecurity knowledge and skills; increase interest in a cybersecurity career and connect participants with employers; create a network of young cybersecurity specialists. ECSC stakeholders are therefore very keen to deepen their understanding of the key elements on which a national cybersecurity competition success is built on. How to increase the impact of cybersecurity competitions: the 6 success factors The new ENISA Report - Towards a Common ECSC roadmap identifies 6 main factors, namely: policy relevance; governance and public–private partnership; funding; public relations and marketing strategy; organisation, training and cybersecurity challenges; connection to employers and career outcomes. What are the recommendations? A number of recommendations are issued for each of the 6 success factors identified. To meet the ECSC’s objectives, a strong foundation is needed. This foundation means developing a systemic learning environment designed to encourage and attract the young into cybersecurity. This could take the form of targeted events or challenges locally organised to spread cybersecurity knowledge geographically and help create small clusters of cybersecurity hubs regionally for instance. As secondary, high school and university students will move up the scale of the education system, this community of cyber-minded young men and women will continue to gather around national or European events and challenges to finally expand the number of professionals in the field. The common roadmap should therefore include three phases at national level to target different age groups accordingly. Besides, policies should be made relevant to a broader audience. Establishing a close cooperation among schools, universities and the public and private sectors to facilitate the dissemination of information could be envisaged as a solution. A funding strategy should be devised. For instance, supporting a model where costs are shared among key actors such as governments together with the private sector could provide more financial stability over time. The creation of a joint working group is also recommended to support the organisation of cybersecurity competitions. This working group would include participants from the Member States and would be in charge of defining standards, providing assistance, creating a central repository of challenges, and coordinating with the different stakeholders. What can ENISA do? The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity can help national competitions obtain the support of national public authorities by leveraging the Agency’s network of national contact points and policymakers. In this respect, ENISA is already providing its support to Member States as described above. At the same time, ENISA can also help with the dissemination of national competitions. Public affairs activities could be further coordinated with the other activities of the Agency in the field. Who is this report for? the organisers of the national cybersecurity competitions who select the team that will attend the ECSC; the EU institutions involved in the organisation and planning of the ECSC, most notably ENISA and the European Commission; the stakeholders that benefit from the success of national cybersecurity competitions, including academia, national governments and the private sector. Background The European Cybersecurity Challenge is an annual competition, coordinated by the European Union Agency for cybersecurity. The event offers a platform for young cyber talent across Europe to gather and engage in networking over a unique opportunity to experience cooperation in trying to solve a cybersecurity problem. The ECSC is intended to encourage young people to pursue a career in cybersecurity, by challenging and developing the participants’ skills needed in such extreme situations and connecting them with industry. Supported by the European Commission and EU Member States, the ECSC falls within the skills chapter of the EU Cyber Security Strategy for the Digital Decade. Upcoming event The next European Cybersecurity Challenge will take place from 28 September to 1 October 2021 in Prague, Czech Republic. The first International Cybersecurity challenge to be organised by ENISA around the end of the year is expected to be officially announced by end of May 2021.

ENISA_PR_0053	2021-04-07	PR	Procurement Guidelines for Cybersecurity in Hospitals: New Online tool for a Customised Experience!	 To facilitate the use of the Procurement Guidelines for Cybersecurity in Hospitals published in 2020, ENISA releases an online tool today to support the healthcare sector in identifying procurement good practices to meet cybersecurity objectives when procuring products or services. In addition, the Agency also publishes a concise version of the procurement guidelines dedicated to the sector in each of the 24 EU official languages. Cybersecurity in Healthcare: why does it matter? The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the value of eHealth services such as telemedicine and remote patient care. Since it has become increasingly digital and interconnected, the healthcare sector needs to consider cybersecurity as an enabler and as a key factor for ensuring the resilience and availability of key healthcare services. Cybersecurity needs to be envisaged throughout the procurement lifecycle. IT departments should be involved in procurement activities as the cybersecurity implications in the procurement of any product or service should be well understood and consistently addressed by healthcare organisations. EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar, declared: “Securing eHealth today means ensuring the resilience of the EU’s life support system, the healthcare sector. ENISA is committed to shape the ICT environment needed to prevent cybersecurity incidents and attacks on our healthcare sector.” Procurement Guidelines and online tool: What for? The online tool was developed as a complement to the procurement guidelines for cybersecurity in hospitals. Its purpose is: To help healthcare organisations to quickly identify the guidelines that are most relevant to their procurement context such as assets procured or related threats; To promote the importance of a good procurement process to ensure appropriate security measures. To facilitate the dissemination of good practices across all healthcare organisations across the EU, a concise version of the procurement guidelines is now made available in the 22 official EU languages and the full version is available in english and spanish languages. The report on procurement guidelines has already generated a significant interest in the healthcare cybersecurity community. Stakeholders in the sector, including members of the eHealth Security Experts Group suggested the idea of an interactive format of the guidelines making it possible to customise searches and help decision making through informed procurement. The guidelines were translated in order to allow health organisations across Member States to directly access the content in their own language. Who is it meant for? Procurement officers of healthcare organisations; Healthcare professionals with technical positions or in charge of IT systems and equipment; Chief level executives such as CIO, CISO, CTO; The EU citizens involved in or seeking to develop knowledge and awareness on such processes. Background The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity has been supporting the healthcare sector in raising cybersecurity capacity and awareness since 2015. The activities in the areas include the publication of good practice guides, the organisation of dedicated cybersecurity conferences and supporting policy implementation such as the provisions of the NIS Directive or the Medical Device Regulations. ENISA published a report on Cloud Security for Healthcare Service in January 2021. This report provides cybersecurity guidelines for healthcare organisations to help further digitalise with the support of cloud services. The report builds on ENISA’s procurement guidelines for cybersecurity in hospitals.

ENISA_NEWS_0054	2021-03-22	NEWS	When & How to Report Security Incidents	 The guidelines published help national telecom security authorities in the reporting of significant incidents to ENISA and the European Commission under the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC). These new guidelines replace the previous ones issued by ENISA on incident reporting under Article 13a of the EU Telecoms Framework Directive. This revised version takes into account the scope and the provisions of the EECC and provides non-binding technical guidance to national authorities supervising security in the electronic communications sector. The following three types of incident reporting are provided for under article 40 of the EECC: National incident reporting from providers to national security authorities; Ad-hoc incident reporting between national security authorities and ENISA; Annual summary reporting from national security authorities to the European Commission and ENISA. Download the Report The new guidelines focus firstly on the ad-hoc incident reporting between the security authorities and ENISA and secondly on the annual summary reporting. More specifically, the document includes information on how and when security authorities can report security incidents to ENISA, to the European Commission and to other security authorities. The information provided considers the services and incidents within the scope of the EECC - incidents affecting confidentiality, availability, integrity and authenticity of networks and services.  The thresholds needed for the annual reporting are also defined.  These thresholds are both of a quantitative and of a qualitative nature. The quantitative elements considered include the number of users affected and the duration of the incident. Qualitative information was also used, such as the geographical coverage of the incident and the impact on the economy, on society and on users. The new guidelines also include an incident report template and draw the distinction between national and annual reporting. This report was drafted by ENISA in close cooperation with the ECASEC expert group of national telecom security authorities. Background The European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) replaces the existing EU Telecoms Framework Directive and brings significant changes in the security supervision of electronic communication services. Established in 2010, the ECASEC Expert Group (formerly the Article 13a Expert Group) consists of more than 50 experts from national telecom security authorities from 31 EU, EFTA and EU candidate countries, all of whom supervise the security of telecom networks and services. The expert group produces technical guidelines for European authorities on the implementation of EU telecom security rules and publishes a summary report about major telecom security incidents on an annual basis.

ENISA_NEWS_0055	2021-03-19	NEWS	Statement on Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities	 Microsoft released security updates for Microsoft (MS) Exchange server suite. Active exploitation has been observed on-premises running MS Exchange installations. MS Exchange vulnerabilities once exploited may lead to network compromise, data exfiltration and ransomware attacks. Across the EU, an increasing number of MS Exchange installations have also been found to be the target of malicious attacks. ENISA published a situation report which provides an assessment as well as advice and mitigation measures. It reports that threat has been assessed as severe and considers these types of attacks probable and of high risk. The Agency calls on organisations using affected Microsoft Exchange versions to patch the flaws immediately and thoroughly investigate for potential signs of compromise. At EU level, the EU CSIRTs Network and EU Cyber Crises Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe) are monitoring the situation and collecting information at both the technical and operational levels. Microsoft is updating advisories and guidance while additional technical information and advice are provided by CERT-EU technical advisory. Download the Report Background The EU Agency for Cybersecurity supports operational cooperation among Member States, Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and between stakeholders. Under the EU Cybersecurity Act of 2019, the Agency gained an extended mandate to contribute to developing a cooperative response at Union and Member States level to large-scale cross-border incidents or crises related to cybersecurity. ENISA provides the secretariat of the EU CSIRTs Network and CyCLONe, supporting their work by offering advice and assistance. The Agency provides strategic foresight and intelligence on cyber threats. The Agency contributes to situational awareness and shares knowledge and information with relevant stakeholders and investigates solutions to boost the efficiency of cyber responses in critical industries across Europe. The CSIRTs Network is a network composed of EU Member States’ appointed CSIRTs and CERT-EU. The European Commission participates in the network as an observer and ENISA acts as the secretariat. The CSIRTs Network contributes to developing confidence and trust between the Member States and to promoting swift and effective operational cooperation. The Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe) contributes to the implementation of the European Commission's Blueprint for rapid emergency response in case of a large-scale cross-border cyber incident or crisis and complements the existing cybersecurity structures at EU level by linking the cooperation at technical (e.g. Computer Security Incident Response Team - CSIRTs) and political levels (e.g. Integrated Political Crisis Response - IPCR). By doing so, the CyCLONe fulfils two objectives: enabling consultations on national response strategies and coordinated impact assessment on the anticipated or observed impacts of a crisis, to the benefit of policy decision-makers, both at national and EU level. CERT-EU and ENISA have signed a memorandum of understanding in 2021 to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of the EU cybersecurity framework.

ENISA_NEWS_0056	2021-03-18	NEWS	Cybersecurity in Railways Conference: Key Takeaways 	" 2021 has been chosen as the European Year of Rail by the European Commission. The European initiative aims to highlight the benefits of rail as a sustainable, smart and safe means of transport to support the delivery of its European Green Deal objectives in the transport field.  Cybersecurity is a key requirement to enable railways to deploy and take advantage of the full extent of a connected, digital environment. However, European infrastructure managers and railway undertakings face a complex regulatory system that requires a deep understanding of operational cybersecurity actions. In addition, European rail is undergoing a major transformation of its operations, systems and infrastructure due to digitalisation, mass transit and, increasing interconnections. Therefore, the implementation of cybersecurity requirements is fundamental for the digital enhancement and security of the sector. ENISA, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, and ERA, the EU Agency for Railways, have joined forces to organise a virtual Conference on Rail Cybersecurity. The conference took place virtually over two days and brought together more than 600 experts from railway organisations, policy, industry, research, standardisation and certification. Policy The European Commission has proposed the revision of the Network Information Security Directive (NIS2) to strengthen the cybersecurity measures to be adopted by the Member States and applied, among others, by European railway undertakings (RU) and infrastructure managers (IM). The European Commission’s Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE) also encourages awareness-raising of railway stakeholders by promoting the use of its Land Transport Security platform. A cybersecurity toolkit was also developed and shared with the participants. Cybersecurity is now a major concern for National Safety Authorities. The French rail safety authority, l’établissement public de sécurité ferroviaire (the EPSF) compiled the related challenges in a white paper, jointly with the French IM and main RU, the French Cybersecurity Agency, ANSSI and ERA. Standardisation & Certification The Working Group 26 of the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (CENELEC) delivered the promising Technical Specification 50701 on cybersecurity for railways, now under review by the National Committees. A published version of the technical specification is expected before the summer. A voluntary reference to this standard will be made through the application guides developed by ERA. Railway stakeholders expect the technical specification to lay the foundations of a common risk analysis methodology. As demonstrated by the case study proposed by the Italian railway stakeholders, such methodology will link the security analysis to the safety case. Research & Innovation Shift2Rail the Joint Undertaking has gained maturity, and the Technical Demonstrator 2.11 on cybersecurity will soon demonstrate the applicability of their findings on specific projects such as Automatic Train Operation or Adaptable Communication Systems. Technical interoperability standards for EU railway automation are being proposed for consideration in the railway regulatory framework, proposing ""secure by design"" shared railway services. In addition, The International Union of Railways (UIC), recently launched a Cyber Security Solution Platform, taking a pragmatic approach in building a solutions catalogue to risks and vulnerabilities identified by railway users. Information Sharing & Cooperation The European Railway-ISAC is attracting an increasing number of participants willing to share concerns or even vulnerabilities to trusted members and ensuring a collective response to the cybersecurity challenge. An open call by Shift2Rail, namely the 4SECURERAIL project, is developing a proposal for a European Computer Security Incident Response Team, allowing for identified threats to be instantly shared with targeted railway stakeholders. With such developments, the railway industry, represented by the European Rail Industry Association (UNIFE), discussed how ready the sector is to increase the level of cybersecurity. UNIFE highlighted several priorities, such as: the approval and usage of the TS 50701, the need for adequate certification schemes on product level,the need for specific protection profiles on interface-specific devices and subsystems. This would allow for a more harmonized approach for manufacturers and system integrators. Conclusions The participants voted topics for future conferences and these include, among others: new technologies; cyber risk management for railways; cyber threat landscape; the update of Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI); cyber skills and training and cyber incident response. Both agencies are paying very close attention to all the developments in the field of railway cybersecurity. The success of the online conference of the last two days shows how railway stakeholders can benefit from close cooperation to ensure that both the cybersecurity and the railway regulatory framework are cross-fertilised. Background The EU Agency for Cybersecurity plays a major role in the implementation of the NIS Directive by supporting Member States and the private sector in achieving a higher level of cybersecurity through the ENISA annual work programme. The Agency has collaborated closely with railway undertakings and infrastructure managers over the years. It has engaged in the work on the implementation of the NIS Directive, and with ERA on cybersecurity for the European Rail Traffic Management System. The Agency also supports the European Railway Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ER-ISAC) and offers expertise in the CEN CENELEC technical committee on Technical Specifications for Rail. The Agency teamed up with ERA last year on a webinar to present the Agencies’ joint activities and to stress the importance of cybersecurity to railway stakeholders. ENISA also released a report on Cybersecurity in Railways assessing the implementation in Member States of the Networks and Information Security Directive (NIS Directive), the first EU-wide cybersecurity legislation working to enhance cybersecurity across the Union. The ENISA publication points to the numerous challenges experienced by operators of essential services when enforcing the NIS Directive, including: an overall lack of cybersecurity awareness in the sector and challenges of operational technology; a strong dependency on the supply chain; the presence of legacy systems; complexities due to the high number of systems to be secured and managed; conflicts between safety and security mind-sets. The report also emphasises the need to find the right balance between cybersecurity, competitiveness and operational efficiency. Further information The slides presented during the conference are available on the webpage of the ENISA ERA conference. If you missed the conference, the video is available on ENISA’s YouTube page.

ENISA_PR_0057	2021-03-11	PR	Building Trust in the Digital Era: ENISA boosts the uptake of the eIDAS regulation	 The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) completed a package of five reports in order to boost the implementation of the eIDAS regulation and promote the uptake of Electronic Identification and Trust Services. This work falls under the scope of the EU Cybersecurity strategy for the Digital Decade. ENISA has been in the forefront of the developments on eIDAS since 2013 and with the Cybersecurity Act, established in 2019, the Agency has an extended mandate to support and assist the European Commission and the Member States in the area of electronic identification. In this challenging period, the “EU digital ID scheme for online transactions across Europe” initiative will drive the revision of the eIDAS and will promote digital identities for all Europeans. ENISA in order to support the Commission has undertaken activities to explore the security considerations for trust service providers and remote identity proofing.   Four of the reports on trust services form an update of ENISA’s guidelines for qualified trust service providers. They represent a voluntary toolset designed to help those trust service providers comply with eIDAS. Specifically, they include: technical guidance on the security framework for Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSP) and for the non-Qualified ones; security recommendations for Qualified Trust Service Providers based on Standards; guidelines on Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers. A fifth report includes an analysis of the methods used to carry out identity proofing remotely and exploring security considerations. Remote identification allows customers to have their identification information collected and validated without the need for physical presence to the premises of the operator. This has become crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic as it allows access to cross-border online services offered by Member States. EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar, stated: “Our lives today increasingly rely on online services. As a consequence, it is crucial we ensure the interoperability and security of electronic identification services across the EU, while simultaneously improving and expanding these services. Moving further towards a secure European Digital Identity will benefit both businesses and consumers in the Digital Market.’’ Technical Guidelines on Trust Services ENISA issued the reports in order to update existing recommendations and guidelines issued in 2017 for qualified trust services. The purpose of these reports is therefore to focus on the requirements set by the eIDAS regulation and the emergence of new standards and new TSP services. The new guidelines are presented in four different reports according to the following topics: trust service providers (qualified or not) looking for guidance on how to meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation; service providers seeking to clarify whether they qualify as a trust service provider according to the provisions under the eIDAS regulation; relying parties seeking to evaluate to what extent their trust service provider complies with the eIDAS requirements. As a result, the set of recommendations include: Security Framework for Qualified Trust Service Providers and for Non-Qualified Trust Service Providers. These guidelines consider the greater potential variety encountered in non-qualified trust service providers; Security Recommendations for Qualified Trust Service Providers based on Standards, and Guidelines on Conformity Assessment of Trust Service Providers. These guidelines have been consulted with and validated by experts in the eIDAS field from various sectors. Analysis of Methods for performing Identity Proofing Remotely Electronic identification under eIDAS constitutes a digital solution designed to provide proof of identity for citizens or organisations, in order to access online services or perform online transactions. Specifically, alternatives are foreseen to physical presence for identity proofing in the context of issuing qualified certificates and in doing so paves the way for remote identity proofing. Other identification methods can also be used provided that they are recognised at national level. To that purpose, national authorities are intended to provide equivalent assurance in terms of reliability and the equivalent assurance shall be confirmed by a Conformity Assessment Body (CAB). The report stresses the need for a harmonised adoption and cross-border recognition of remote identity proofing methods as those are the key elements for an extended use of digital services and for cross-border transactions within the internal market. Questioned on their practices, 11 out of 27 European Supervisory Bodies stated that they already accepted methods for remote identity proofing. In the same way the eIDAS regulation has made it possible for trust service and electronic identification systems to use remote identity proofing, the fifth Anti-money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) has also introduced this technique in the financial sector. This report provides an overview of the most common methods for identity proofing illustrated by practical examples received by the different stakeholders. It also presents the current legal/regulatory landscape and supporting standards at the international and EU level. In addition, it gives an overview of the status quo in the EU Member States on their remote identity proofing laws, regulations and practices. The report also analyses the input received through questionnaires from different stakeholders which use, offer or evaluate identity proofing solutions. In particular, the contribution of 80 different stakeholders show the importance of this topic and is the object of a study currently being performed by ETSI special task force (STF) 588.  Read the full report here: Analysis of methods to carry out identity proofing remotely Event announcement – save the date for the Trust Services Forum 2021 Together with the European Commission, ENISA will organise the Trust Service Forum on 21st September 2021. This edition takes place for the 7th year in 2021 following its inception in 2015. Collocated with D-TRUST/TUVIT CA Day on 22 September 2021, the event is to take place in Berlin, Germany, provided that the current travelling and gathering restrictions will be lifted by then.

ENISA_NEWS_0058	2021-03-05	NEWS	Achieving Harmonisation and Cyber Resilience in the Finance Sector	 The finance sector is subject to both EU and national legislations. This sector, which stands as a crucial backbone of the European economy, is extremely dependent on ICT infrastructures, providers, and their supply chain. The cybersecurity provisions dedicated to this sector are included in a variety of EU legislation, standards, and guidelines. Stakeholders such as EU institutions, bodies, and agencies, as well as other public and private associations run several initiatives addressing the cybersecurity requirements for the secure operation of financial entities across the Union. The report - EU Cybersecurity Initiatives in the Finance Sector - published today guides the reader towards European cybersecurity initiatives dedicated to the finance sector. Its purpose is to map today’s reality of a very complex cybersecurity landscape in the EU finance sector. The need for a strengthened cooperation between the key actors of the finance sector at the European level has become urgent now, as the sector faces larger-scale cyber challenges of a more harmful nature. The information presented in this document seeks to add more clarity and improve the cooperation between the different groups involved in these initiatives. In presenting to what extent the initiatives complement or overlap with one another, it provides the possibility of identifying potential gaps and existing synergies. It also helps to draw attention to existing initiatives and their results (guidelines, standards, legislation, etc.). The European cyber initiatives in the finance sector are grouped according to topics defined in the Cybersecurity Act, namely: Development and implementation of policy; Information sharing and capacity building; Cyber crisis management; Awareness-raising and training; Standardisation and certification; Research and innovation. The list is obviously not exhaustive and is meant to evolve following the developments in the sector. Background With the Cybersecurity Act (CSA), signed in June 2019, the Agency has become the key instrument needed to address the EU’s ambition of significantly reinforcing cybersecurity across Europe. The Agency continues its support to the Union decision-making institutions in relation to the announced review of the NIS Directive, as well as the proposed legislation, the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).

ENISA_PR_0060	2021-03-02	PR	ENISA and CERT-EU sign Agreement to start their Structured Cooperation	 The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), signed by ENISA and CERT-EU on 15th February, was announced on the occasion of the 13th CSIRTs Network meeting. The agreement is the successful outcome of extensive and fruitful discussions triggered by the Cybersecurity Act to identify and enhance the synergies between the two organisations. With a view to better fulfil their respective mandates, this MoU sets the frame for supporting each other’s work and achieve a higher degree of efficiency. EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar, said: “The agreement ENISA signed with CERT-EU is a stepping-stone in utilising our synergies to the benefit of EU Member States and the EU Institutions, Agencies and Bodies. I am confident that this collaboration will build and enhance capabilities and preparedness to prevent, detect and respond to cyber threats and incidents at Union level.” The Head of CERT-EU, Saâd Kadhi, commented: “We are proud of this achievement, which sets the path for a greater collaboration between our two organisations, to better serve our respective constituencies. Our structured cooperation comes at a time where the EU and its Member States need to strengthen their cybersecurity capabilities more than ever.” Why a Memorandum of Understanding? The agreement comes about as an effort to create meaningful, mutually beneficial synergies between both organisations. Possible overlaps or duplication of activities will be prevented. The agreement will thus directly feed into the ongoing, Union-wide efforts to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of the EU cybersecurity framework and its actors. This will also allow more value for money to be gained for EU citizens, taxpayers and the respective constituencies of both organisations. What is the scope of the agreement? The structured cooperation follows the provisions of Article 7.4 of the Cybersecurity Act. This article allows for ENISA and CERT-EU to explore and take advantage of synergies. The cooperation shall cover those activities, which are necessary to assist Member States and EU Institutions, Bodies and Agencies in the following areas: Capacity Building Operational Cooperation Knowledge and Information. Where does the cooperation stand now and what happens next? The structured cooperation will be implemented on the basis of an Annual Cooperation Plan (ACP), which describes joint activities and projects and their implementation requirements, in line with the provisions of the work programme of each party. ACPs will be developed under the supervision and subject to the approval of the governing bodies of each organisation, namely the Management Board of ENISA and the Steering Board of CERT-EU. All relevant stakeholders as well as Member States’ CSIRTs and the EU Institutions, Bodies and Agencies will be consulted for that purpose. Who does what? Considering that both organisations deal and engage in activities in the field of cybersecurity at European Union level, a distinction needs to be made between the roles and responsibilities of ENISA and those of CERT-EU. CERT-EU’s mission is to contribute to the security of the information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures of all European Union Institutions, Bodies and Agencies ('the constituents') by helping to prevent, detect, mitigate and respond to cyber-attacks. CERT-EU acts as a cybersecurity information exchange and incident response coordination hub for all the European Union Institutions, Bodies and Agencies. It gathers information on threats, vulnerabilities and incidents in order to alert its constituents when necessary. In addition, in case of cyber incidents, CERT-EU is responsible for coordinating the response across the entire constituency. Reinforcing the capacity of all European Union Institutions, Bodies and Agencies to deal with cyber-threats and vulnerabilities against their ICT infrastructures remains a high priority as functioning ICT networks and systems are critical to their ability to fulfil their missions. The role of ENISA is to support operational cooperation among Member States, Union Institutions, Bodies, Offices and Agencies. ENISA is mandated to ensure that an effective cooperation framework is in place among the operational actors within the Union in case of large-scale cross-border cyber-attacks and crises. ENISA provides the secretariat of the CSIRTs Network and supports its work by offering advice. The Agency also responds to ad-hoc requests for assistance from Member States and provides information and analysis to support policy-makers to ensure that cybersecurity is embedded across all domains of EU policy. The work of the Agency also entails helping and guiding Member States to implement the relevant legislation. It is meant to provide strategic foresight and intelligence on cyberthreats. The Agency contributes to situational awareness and shares information and knowledge with relevant stakeholders and investigates solutions to boost the efficiency of cyber responses in critical industries across Europe. Background The CSIRTs Network is a network composed of EU Member States’ appointed CSIRTs and CERT-EU. The European Commission participates in the network as an observer and ENISA acts as the secretariat. The CSIRTs Network contributes to developing confidence and trust between the Member States and to promoting swift and effective operational cooperation.

ENISA_NEWS_0061	2021-02-24	NEWS	Cybersecurity for 5G: ENISA Releases Report on Security Controls in 3GPP	 Today, the Agency released its Security in 5G Specifications Report about key security controls in the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the main body developing technical specifications for fifth generation of mobile telecommunications (5G) networks. As vendors, system integrators and operators build, deploy and manage 5G networks, the ENISA publication underlines the need for cybersecurity and for the national regulatory authorities in charge of cybersecurity policy development and implementation to have a good understanding of these controls. This new ENISA report is directly driven by the objectives set in the EU toolbox for 5G security - mainly technical measure ‘TM02’. This technical measure calls on the relevant authorities in EU Member States to ensure and evaluate the implementation of security measures in existing 5G standards (3GPP specifically) by operators and their suppliers. The aim of the report is to help national and regulatory authorities to better understand the standardisation environment pertaining to 5G security, 3GPP security specifications and key security controls that operators must implement to secure 5G networks. More specifically, the report provides: A high-level overview of the specification and standardisation landscape for the security of 5G networks, and of the main activities by various standardisation organisations and industrial groups in the area of 5G; An explanation of the technical specifications developed by 3GPP for the security of 5G networks, with a focus on optional security features; Summary of key findings and good security practices. The ENISA report also covers security considerations beyond standards and specifications, such as testing and assurance, product development, network design, configuration and deployment, and operation and management. Audience The target audience of this report includes representatives of national ministries and national cybersecurity agencies who are members of the NIS Cooperation Group and who are engaged in the workstream on 5G cybersecurity, as well as the competent authorities in charge of overseeing security measures under the European Electronic Communications Code. Background In December 2020, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity published an updated version of its 5G threat assessment report (ENISA Threat Landscape for 5G Networks report) to address advancements in the areas of 5G and to contribute to the implementation of the EU toolbox for 5G security cybersecurity risk-mitigating measures. Just last month, following a request by the European Commission, the Agency announced that it would proceed with the preparation of the new candidate cybersecurity certification scheme on 5G. This step is expected to enhance the cybersecurity of 5G networks as it contributes to addressing certain risks, as part of a broader risk mitigation strategy.   More information on the Union’s actions to strengthen cybersecurity capacities for 5G networks is available in this brochure.

ENISA_PR_0062	2021-02-11	PR	Cybersecurity Challenges in the Uptake of Artificial Intelligence in Autonomous Driving	 By removing the most common cause of traffic accidents – the human driver – autonomous vehicles are expected to reduce traffic accidents and fatalities. However, they may pose a completely different type of risk to drivers, passengers and pedestrians. Autonomous vehicles use artificial intelligence systems, which employ machine-learning techniques to collect, analyse and transfer data, in order to make decisions that in conventional cars are taken by humans. These systems, like all IT systems, are vulnerable to attacks that could compromise the proper functioning of the vehicle. A new report by ENISA and JRC sheds light on the cybersecurity risks linked to the uptake of AI in autonomous vehicles, and provides recommendations to mitigate them. “When an insecure autonomous vehicle crosses the border of an EU Member State, so do its vulnerabilities. Security should not come as an afterthought, but should instead be a prerequisite for the trustworthy and reliable deployment of vehicles on Europe’s roads,” said EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar. “It is important that European regulations ensure that the benefits of autonomous driving will not be counterbalanced by safety risks. To support decision-making at EU level, our report aims to increase the understanding of the AI techniques used for autonomous driving as well as the cybersecurity risks connected to them, so that measures can be taken to ensure AI security in autonomous driving,” said JRC Director-General Stephen Quest. Vulnerabilities of AI in autonomous vehicles The AI systems of an autonomous vehicle are working non-stop to recognise traffic signs and road markings, to detect vehicles, estimate their speed, to plan the path ahead. Apart from unintentional threats, such as sudden malfunctions, these systems are vulnerable to intentional attacks that have the specific aim to interfere with the AI system and to disrupt safety-critical functions. Adding paint on the road to misguide the navigation, or stickers on a stop sign to prevent its recognition are examples of such attacks. These alterations can lead to the AI system wrongly classifying objects, and subsequently to the autonomous vehicle behaving in a way that could be dangerous. Recommendations for more secure AI in autonomous vehicles In order to improve the AI security in autonomous vehicles, the report contains several recommendations, one of which is that security assessments of AI components are performed regularly throughout their lifecycle. This systematic validation of AI models and data is essential to ensure that the vehicle always behaves correctly when faced with unexpected situations or malicious attacks. Another recommendation is that continuous risk assessment processes supported by threat intelligence could enable the identification of potential AI risks and emerging threats related to the uptake of AI in autonomous driving. Proper AI security policies and an AI security culture should govern the entire supply chain for automotive. The automotive industry should embrace a security by design approach for the development and deployment of AI functionalities, where cybersecurity becomes the central element of digital design from the beginning. Finally, it is important that the automotive sector increas­es its level of preparedness and reinforces its inci­dent response capabilities to handle emerging cy­bersecurity issues connected to AI.

ENISA_NEWS_0063	2021-02-09	NEWS	Solving the Cryptography Riddle: Post-quantum Computing & Crypto-assets Blockchain Puzzles	 Cryptography is a vital part of cybersecurity. Security properties like confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation rely on strong cryptographic mechanisms, especially in an always connected, always online world. In addition, cryptography’s applications open up new opportunities and markets: digital signatures or online transactions would not be possible without it. Given its importance, cryptography (encryption) remains a heavily researched field, and even finds its way into the headlines, referred to in high level documents and even legislation. One such document is the new EU Cybersecurity Strategy (December 2020), which mentions out quantum computing and encryption as key technologies for achieving resilience, technological sovereignty and leadership. With the objective to support the implementation of the Cybersecurity Strategy and of relevant legislative efforts, ENISA publishes two reports on the topic of cryptography. The first one focuses on the forthcoming disruptions of post-quantum computing on our present cybersecurity infrastructure and how we need to mitigate it. The second one introduces the cryptographic building blocks used in a majority of digital currencies & crypto-assets, which will fall under the scope of a new EU regulatory proposal. Post Quantum security and why it matters Quantum technology will enable a huge leap forward in many branches of industry, as it can efficiently resolve problems technologies of today are not able to provide a solution for. However, this technology will be highly disruptive for our current security equipment and systems. As a matter of fact, scientists commonly agree that quantum computers will be able to break widely used public-key cryptographic schemes. These are the same schemes working behind the green lock in our browser tabs telling us that our data are protected against malicious eavesdroppers. Similarly, these are also the same schemes allowing us to have digital signatures and designed to implement the Electronic identification (eID) and Trust Services of the eIDAs regulation. Consequently, data or processes protected by those schemes, such as bank transactions, software updates, digitally signed official documents, patient records and more, will instantly cease to be secure. This initiative is motivated by the fact that the transition to new quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms will take years, since the related processes are both extremely intricate and financially costly. The study - Post-Quantum Cryptography: Current state and quantum mitigation - provides a concise overview of the current progress of the standardisation process of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) schemes. It introduces a framework to analyse existing quantum-safe solutions, classifying them into families and discussing their advantages and shortcomings. With contributions from top experts in the field, it helps readers navigate an overly complex but also fascinating topic for the future of cybersecurity. The study aims to help decision makers and system designers take up appropriate actions, as soon as possible. To that end, it includes useful quantum resistant techniques that can be implemented in today’s systems until PQC algorithms become standardised and generally available. Under the hood of crypto assets & the Distributed Ledger Technology With the creation of a pan-European blockchain regulatory sandbox, the European Union intends to put Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) to the test. Such technologies, also referred to as blockchain technologies, are those on which digital assets such as cryptocurrencies are built upon. But the applications do not stop there, smart contracts, anti-counterfeit seals, even games, have been based on a few important cryptographic building blocks. The ENISA report - Crypto Assets: Introduction to Digital Currencies and Distributed Ledger Technologies - aims to further increase understanding around these underlying cryptographic components that compose the blockchain and in extension crypto-assets, digital currencies and the host of applications possible. As a continuation of an earlier report on the security and challenges of DLTs, this report provides an in-depth explanation of the technical components involved and illustrates their uses into popular deployed instances. By focusing on crypto-assets, ENISA intends to support policymakers by explaining the underling cryptographic mechanics used and raise awareness on foreseen security, financial, legal and data protection issues. Background This work falls under the provisions of Articles 5, 8, 9 and 11 of the Cybersecurity Act. ENISA's Work Programme foresees activities to support Knowledge Building in Cryptographic algorithms. In cooperation with the European Commission, Member States and other EU bodies, the Agency engages with expert groups to address emerging challenges and promote good practices. One of these emerging risks arise in relation to quantum computing cryptanalytics capabilities, where there is need to transition to quantum safe encryption as a counter measure and to support EU in advancing its strategic digital autonomy. In addition, the continuation of past ENISA work on blockchain security with a new study looking at the cryptographic components was very timely as it coincided with the EU efforts in regulating crypto-assets and the announcement of the ECB that it is exploring the plausibility of a centrally backed digital euro, to complement the euro banknote.

ENISA_NEWS_0064	2021-02-05	NEWS	Highlights of the Cybersecurity  Standardisation Conference	 The European Standards Organisations, CEN, CENELEC and ETSI, joined forces with ENISA, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, to organise its annual conference virtually this year. The event, which took place from 2nd to 4th February, attracted over 2000 participants from the EU and from around the world. The conference addressed standardisation in relation to the Radio Equipment Directive (RED) and certification under the provisions of the Cybersecurity Act (CSA). Objectives of the conference The purpose of the conference was twofold. The event presented the current developments in the areas. It was also intended to foster a dialogue among policymakers, industry, research, standardisation and certification organisations, including all of those involved in the development of the ICT certification framework in Europe. The ultimate objective of the exercise is to implement the Cybersecurity Act in the most effective way. The objectives of the presentations and key topics addressed by the conference panels were the following: Cybersecurity requirements and standardisation activities under the scope of the Radio Equipment Directive: The presentation focussed on the cybersecurity requirements of the Directive. The European Commission is preparing delegated acts as well as a request for standardisation to CEN-CENELEC and ETSI. The panel highlighted the connection between the European regulatory requirements and explored how standardisation can align with the EU policy goals in a global context. The participants were invited to discuss the link between the requirements of the RED and those associated with the Cybersecurity Act. Standardisation supporting the Cybersecurity Act This part of the conference introduced the current state of play in cybersecurity standardisation. The purpose of the discussion was also to draw attention to the gaps identified that need to the bridged. Each panellist was given the floor to present updates from their organisations. Developments on standardisation in the area of Consumer IoT: The panel addressed the situation of standardisation in this area in relation to the general security standard active since last year. The attention was drawn on sectorial standards and whether standards for smart homes, the automotive or house appliance for instance would be relevant ones to address. Interesting questions came up to liven the debate on the subsequent steps of certification, on how certification will impact end user behaviour or how to promote certified products. Standardisation of 5G, next steps foreseen: The panel engaged in a discussion on the progress made so far on the standardisation of 5G. As preparations for a cybersecurity certification scheme for 5G networks are now beginning, important aspects needed to be addressed. It was important to stress the potential of certification given the number of initiatives already launched in the area and identify prospects for the future. Cybersecurity Certification Securing EU’s Vision on 5G: Cybersecurity Certification The last panel closed the conference on a discussion focussed on the future of cybersecurity certification in general. It comes as the European Commission requested ENISA to prepare a candidate cybersecurity certification scheme on 5G networks on 3rd February 2021. How should the standardisation activities be prepared? How should these activities match with and help achieve the goals of the Union rolling work programme? Such questions remain to be answered in a comprehensive way. As evidenced by the high number of participants such questions obviously stimulate the interest of a very large audience showing how crucial it is to open the debate as widely as possible to respond to these challenges adequately. Therefore, the audience of the conference and the public at large are most likely to expect a follow-up edition to take place in early 2022. Background Article 8 of the Cybersecurity Act gives mandate to the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity to monitor developments in the area of standardisation. The work of the Agency builds on the on-going standardisation work of the European Standardisation Organisations: CEN, CENELEC, ETSI, as well as the Cybersecurity Coordination Group (CSCG). ENISA engages its expertise to support these organisations, the European Commission and all other relevant stakeholders. In addition, ENISA is also cooperating with the Standard Developing Organisations (SDOs), namely ISO SC27 (Liaison), ETSI (Memorandum of Understanding) and CEN CENELEC (Collaboration agreement).

ENISA_PR_0065	2021-02-03	PR	Securing EU’s Vision on 5G: Cybersecurity Certification	 Following a request by the European Commission, ENISA will proceed with the preparation of the new candidate cybersecurity certification scheme on 5G. This step follows on from the EU toolbox for 5G security and it is expected to further enhance the cybersecurity of 5G networks as it contributes to addressing certain risks, as part of a broader risk mitigation strategy.   To this effect, a cybersecurity certification scheme on 5G will be based on provisions already available by means of existing cybersecurity certification schemes as well as experience already acquired since the Agency started engaging in cybersecurity certification. European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Thierry Breton, stated that: “Security is at the core of 5G technology roll-out. EU-wide certification, in combination with other types of measures in the EU 5G Toolbox, supports our efforts to optimise 5G security and patch technical vulnerabilities. This is why it is important that Member States make further progress in implementing the Toolbox”. EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar, said: “The certification of 5G networks emerges as the logical next step in the EU Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade. The new initiative builds on the actions already engaged in to mitigate the cybersecurity risks of the 5G technology”. This request meets the requirements of the Cybersecurity Act, which allows the European Commission to issue a request for a cybersecurity certification scheme to ENISA outside the scope of the Union Rolling Work Programme, if duly justified. ENISA is looking forward to contributing and supporting the Commission in the development and realisation of a cybersecurity certification scheme for 5G and will cooperate with and take due account of the inputs of relevant stakeholders. The European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG), the NIS Cooperation Group Work Stream and its subgroup on 5G standardisation and certification will be informed of the planning and progress continuously and will be given many opportunities to participate. Experts in 5G will be invited to be involved via the ad hoc working group work that ENISA will establish for the scheme development. The call will be published on ENISA’s website. Background Adopted in 2019, the Cybersecurity Act established the European Cybersecurity Certification Framework that allows creating market-driven EU certification schemes and helps reduce fragmentation between existing cyber certification schemes. This framework will deliver certification schemes recognised in all Member States, making it easier for businesses to trade across borders and for users to understand the security features of the product or service. More information on the EU's actions to strengthen cybersecurity capacities, including for 5G networks, are available in this brochure.

ENISA_PR_0066	2021-01-28	PR	Cybersecurity to the Rescue: Pseudonymisation for Personal Data Protection 	 Today, on the occasion of Data Protection Day 2021, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) released its report on pseudonymisation for personal data protection - Data Pseudonymisation: Advanced Techniques and Use Cases - providing a technical analysis of cybersecurity measures in personal data protection and privacy. This new work builds on the Agency’s past work on pseudonymisation techniques and best practices by exploring further, advanced pseudonymisation techniques and specific use cases in such areas as healthcare and information sharing in cybersecurity.   While not a new process, pseudonymisation came into the spotlight in 2018 with the enforcement of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which references pseudonymisation as a security and data protection by design mechanism. Although the deployment and proper application of data pseudonymisation techniques have become highly debated, the overall context of the processing is considered as an important aspect for implementation. Therefore, pseudonymisation should be combined with a thorough security and data protection risk assessment. EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar said: “Cybersecurity techniques are an integral part to meet data protection obligations, and allow users to enjoy fully their fundamental rights to personal data protection and privacy.” As there is no one-size-fits-all pseudonymisation technique, a high level of competence is needed to reduce threats and maintain efficiency in processing pseudonymised data across different scenarios. The ENISA report aims to support data controllers and processors in implementing pseudonymisation by providing possible techniques and use cases that could fit different scenarios. The report underlines the need to take steps that include the following: Each case of personal data processing needs to be analysed to determine the most suitable technical option in relation to pseudonymisation; An in-depth look into the context of personal data processing before data pseudonymisation is applied; Continuous analysis of state-of-the-art in the field of data pseudonymisation, as new research and business models break new ground; Developing advanced pseudonymisation scenarios for more complex cases, for example when the risks of personal data processing are deemed to be high; Further discussion on the broader adoption of data pseudonymisation at EU and Member States levels alike. Background The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity has been working in the area of privacy and data protection since 2014, by analysing technical solutions for the implementation of the GDPR, privacy by design and security of personal data processing. Since 2018, the Agency has been providing guidance on data pseudonymisation solutions to data controllers and processors. In January 2019, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity issued recommendations on shaping technology according to GDPR provisions, providing an overview on data pseudonymisation. In November 2019, the Agency published a more detailed report on pseudonymisation techniques and best practices and co-organised a workshop with the Data Protection Authority of the German Federal State of Schleswig-Holstein (ULD) on pseudonymisation and relevant security techniques. ENISA is now focusing its work on the practical application of data pseudonymisation techniques.  Earlier today, on 28 January, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity led a panel, “Securing Personal Data: The ‘New’ Normal”, at the 14th international Computers, Privacy and Data Protection (CPDP) conference. ENISA Cybersecurity Expert Prokopios Drogkaris moderated the virtual panel discussion on how COVID-19 affected the existing considerations related to the security of personal data processing. Featured panellists included Rosa Barcelo, Squire Patton Boggs; Cédric Lauradoux, INRIA, Fabian Prasser, Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin; Peter Kraus, EDPB .

ENISA_NEWS_0067	2021-01-26	NEWS	Training Together to Fight Cybercrime: Improving Cooperation	 The publications are designed to help tackle the challenges of this complex multi-stakeholder cooperation. The report, the handbook and the toolset are a set of deliverables complementing each other as follows: The report analyses roles, duties, competences, synergies and potential interferences across Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) - in particular, national and governmental ones, LE and judiciary (prosecutors and judges); The handbook helps a trainer explain these concepts through different scenarios; The toolset consists of exercises meant for trainees based on the handbook’s scenarios. The report proposes a methodology to analyse the legal and organisational framework defining the roles and duties, the required competencies of CSIRTs and LE. It also identifies synergies and the potential interferences that may occur while engaging in the activities needed to respond to incidents of criminal nature and in fighting cybercrime. In addition, it presents a detailed analysis focusing on Czechia, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Romania, and Sweden. The methodology proposed can be used for a more comprehensive future analysis covering additional countries as it is based on: desk research; subject matter expert interviews; the segregation of duties (SoD) matrix. This SoD matrix is also available in the ENISA repositories in GitHub, as well as the documentation on the Reference Security Incident Taxonomy Working Group (RSIT). The RSIT working group will meet today as part of the 62nd TF-CSIRT Meeting. These are two other examples of the efforts ENISA engages in to contribute to building a bridge between CSIRTs and LE communities. Main conclusions of the 2020 report on CSIRTs and LE cooperation include: The communities already engage in a number of actions meant to: Avoid interferences wherever possible; Create effective partnerships; Use their synergies to support each other. However, interferences may still happen in the process of incident handling and cybercrime investigations, mainly because of the difference in purpose and mandate of each of these communities, i.e. incident mitigation (CSIRTs) compared with evidence preservation and criminal prosecution (LE and the judiciary). Joint training activities are organised mainly in community pairs, being either CSIRT and LE or LE and the judiciary. Such activities rarely involve the three communities. The joint training activities help the wider development of the competences required to respond to cybercrime. Overall, the 2019 pandemic of the COVID-19 virus did not have any significant impact on cooperation and exchanges between the three communities and their ability to function. Interaction even increased in some instances. For example, daily dialogues became more frequent in order to ensure that each community was kept informed as the situation evolved. Access the report and the training ENISA Report on CSIRT-LE Cooperation - A study of the roles and synergies among selected countries Training - Aspects of Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement Agencies Background The response to cybercrime requires the cooperation of all actors involved. In this response, CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary perform each a different role and seek different objectives. Helping CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary understand their roles, duties and competences reciprocally will allow a closer cooperation while building on synergies and hence avoid possible interferences. ENISA has been collecting input from the communities and compiling reports to shed light on the different aspects of the cooperation. These efforts are meant to further enhance the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the judiciary, In addition, the Agency has been developing training material and co-organising the annual ENISA-EC3 workshop on CSIRT-LE Cooperation. The last edition of this event took place on 16 September 2020. This new report and training material build on the work already completed in the area over the past. It contributed to the implementation of the ENISA programming document 2020-2022. The work conducted by ENISA in this area is planned to continue in 2021.

ENISA_PR_0068	2021-01-18	PR	Securing Cloud Services for Health	 Today, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) published the Cloud Security for Healthcare Services report, which provides cybersecurity guidelines for healthcare organisations to help further digitalise with cloud services. Building on ENISA’s procurement guidelines for cybersecurity in hospitals, published early last year, this new report assesses the cybersecurity risks of cloud services and offers good practices for their secure integration into the European healthcare sector. The ENISA report comes as the European Commission is moving forward this year with the European Health Data Space initiative to promote the safe exchange of patients’ data and access to health data. The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined an increased need for efficient – and secure – digital healthcare services. Cloud solutions allow for the flexible and rapid deployment of the electronic storage of data and electronic communications such as telemedicine. However, the complexity of legal systems and new technologies, as well as concerns over the security of sensitive patient data have slowed the healthcare sector in adopting cloud services. EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar said: “A resilient health sector relies on secure digital solutions. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity provides healthcare organisations with guidance to address cybersecurity concerns related to cloud services and is preparing an EU Cloud Cybersecurity Certification scheme, both of which aim to do just that.” The report addresses these concerns by providing security guidelines for three main areas in which cloud services are used by the healthcare sector, namely for: Electronic Health Record (EHR), i.e. systems focusing on the collection, storage, management and transmission of health data, such as patient information and medical exam results; Remote Care, i.e. the subset of telemedicine supporting remote patient-doctor consultation; Medical Devices, i.e. cloud services supporting the operation of medical devices such as making medical device data available to different stakeholders or for device monitoring. For each of these use cases, the report highlights the main factors to be considered when healthcare organisations conduct the relevant risk assessment – for example, in terms of risk to sensitive patient data or availability of a medical service. These guidelines, however, are only a first step for healthcare providers to adapt securely to the cloud. More support is needed, such as established industry standards on cloud security, specific direction from national and EU authorities, and further guidelines from Data Protection Authorities on transferring healthcare data to the cloud. The report also proposes a set of security measures for healthcare organisations to implement when planning their move to cloud services, such as establishing processes for incident management, defining data encryption requirements, and ensuring data portability and interoperability. The measures are proposed taking into consideration the draft candidate EU Cybersecurity Certification Scheme on Cloud Services (EUCS) to ensure compatibility and requirements mapping. The Agency’s draft scheme is part of the larger cybersecurity certification framework aimed at enhancing trust in ICT products, services and processes across Europe. The draft scheme is open for public consultation until 7 February 2021. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity will continue its work to strengthen the cybersecurity of Europe’s healthcare sector by publishing guidelines, promoting information sharing, collaborating with policy-makers and organising events such as the annual eHealth Conference, addressing the healthcare sector’s major cybersecurity challenges.

ENISA_NEWS_0069	2021-01-08	NEWS	ENISA and eu-LISA – Cooperation for a More Digitally Resilient Europe	" Within the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the current Recovery Plan for Europe put forward by the European Commission, the words “digital” and “resilience” are prominent and at times used together. When combined they bring to mind IT-related challenges that need to be addressed to ensure a stronger and safer Europe for its citizens. One of the primary concerns is cybersecurity; and, given that this is a topic of common interest to the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) and the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA), it gives the two Agencies further impetus to work together to face this growing threat. Earlier today Executive Directors Juhan Lepassaar (ENISA) and Krum Garkov (eu-LISA) signed a multiannual Cooperation Plan. The plan sets out activities that will provide benefits through joint actions to the Agencies themselves and to the EU Member States. The three-year Cooperation Plan complements the existing regulations applicable to ENISA and eu-LISA, and lays out various actions within complimentary areas that the Agencies can draw benefits from by sharing knowledge, information and expertise. Information Security, Business Continuity, Research, Data Protection and Corporate Quality Management are among the priority areas identified for collaboration. ENISA Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar said: “Securing our digital future is facilitated by sharing knowledge and expertise. This Cooperation Plan will allow our Agencies to find solutions together.” ""With cybersecurity and digital resilience high on the European agenda for the coming years, it seems fitting to take the opportunity to strengthen our cooperation with ENISA and to boost our common contributions to the goals set for Europe's digital future. There are many areas where our respective consolidated expertise can be put to good use. The EU Cybersecurity Strategy, adopted by the Commission in December, is one of these and the fast changing landscape of cyber threats including the ensuing need to secure common cyber spaces are examples of where we can mutually assist each other. This renewed agreement is the best way to kick-off 2021 and eu-LISA is looking forward to extending its relationship with ENISA."" said Krum Garkov, Executive Director of eu-LISA. It is in the common interest of both Agencies to promote and share activities with their stakeholders and the general public in order to provide increased visibility and further improve awareness of their respective responsibilities and joint successes. For this reason, the Cooperation Plan includes core activity related plans, as well as communication and information sharing as important areas for joint actions.

ENISA_PR_0070	2020-12-22	PR	Cloud Certification Scheme: Building Trusted Cloud Services Across Europe	 Today, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) launched a public consultation, which runs until 7 February 2021, on its draft of the candidate European Union Cybersecurity Certification Scheme on Cloud Services (EUCS). The scheme aims to further improve the Union’s internal market conditions for cloud services by enhancing and streamlining the services’ cybersecurity guarantees. The draft EUCS candidate scheme intends to harmonise the security of cloud services with EU regulations, international standards, industry best practices, as well as with existing certifications in EU Member States. EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar said: “Cloud services play an increasing role in the life of European citizens and businesses under lockdown; and their security is essential to the functioning of the Digital Single Market. A single European cloud certification is critical for enabling the free flow of data across Europe, and is an important factor in fostering innovation and competitiveness in Europe.” Speaking at the ENISA Cybersecurity Certification Conference on 18 December 2020, Director of Digital Society, Trust and Cybersecurity at the European Commission Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT) Lorena Boix Alonso said: “We must ensure that cybersecurity certification strikes the right balance, following a sensible risk-based approach, with flexible solutions and certification schemes designed to avoid being outdated quickly. And we need a clear roadmap to allow industry, national authorities and standardisation bodies to prepare in advance.” There are challenges to the certification of cloud services, such as a diverse set of market players, complex systems and a constantly evolving landscape of cloud services, as well as the existence of different schemes in Member States. The draft EUCS candidate scheme tackles these challenges by calling for cybersecurity best practices across three levels of assurance and by allowing for a transition from current national schemes in the EU. The draft EUCS candidate scheme is a horizontal and technological scheme that intends to provide cybersecurity assurance throughout the cloud supply chain, and form a sound basis for sectoral schemes. More specifically, the draft EUCS candidate scheme: Is a voluntary scheme; The scheme’s certificates will be applicable across the EU Member States; Is applicable for all kinds of cloud services – from infrastructure to applications; Boosts trust in cloud services by defining a reference set of security requirements; Covers three assurance levels: ‘Basic’, ‘Substantial’ and ‘High’; Proposes a new approach inspired by existing national schemes and international standards; Defines a transition path from national schemes in the EU; Grants a three-year certification that can be renewed; Includes transparency requirements such as the location of data processing and storage. Public Consultation The public consultation allows interested parties to provide feedback on the draft EUCS candidate scheme. The outcome of this consultation will be processed and shared with the public. The consultation will remain open until 7 February 2021, 12:00 CET. To review the draft scheme, visit: Draft EUCS Candidate Scheme. The consultation is closed. For more information please consult the following EUCS – Cloud Services Scheme. During the period of the public consultation, a review by the European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG) and the Stakeholder Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG) will also be undertaken. Following the consultation, the EUCS candidate scheme will be updated and submitted to the ECCG for its opinion. WEBINAR: ENISA Cybersecurity Certification of Cloud Services On 11 January 2021, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity will hold a webinar presentation of the draft EUCS candidate scheme. ENISA Lead Certification Expert Eric Vétillard will present the current draft and will lead a Q&A session with participants. The webinar is open to the public. To register for the 11 January 2021 event, visit: WEBINAR: ENISA Cybersecurity Certification of Cloud Services. Background on ENISA Cybersecurity Certification Under the EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA) of 2019, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity assists in the preparation of candidate cybersecurity certification schemes. The EUCS consultation is established in accordance with Article 49(3) of the CSA. The current draft of the EUCS candidate scheme is based on expert input from the Cloud Service Provider Certification (CSPCERT) Working Group and the EUCS ad-hoc working group, which includes members from industry, and participants from Member States and European Institutions. The draft also takes into consideration international standards and national certification schemes across the Union.   The draft EUCS candidate scheme is the second candidate cybersecurity certification scheme introduced by the EU Agency for Cybersecurity this year. In July 2020, the Common Criteria Based European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme (EUCC), which aims to replace the existing schemes operating under the SOG-IS MRA for ICT products, opened for a month-long public consultation. The ENISA Cybersecurity Certification Conference On 18 December 2020, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity held the first online ENISA Cybersecurity Certification Conference to provide updates on cybersecurity and certification work by the European Commission, the Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the Agency. The conference also covered the latest and upcoming developments on certification schemes, including the draft EUCC and EUCS candidate schemes, and topics such as international standards for IoT.

ENISA_PR_0072	2020-12-17	PR	ENISA welcomes the EU Cybersecurity Strategy and Agency’s proposed tasks	 The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) welcomes the Joint Communication on the EU’s new Cybersecurity Strategy. The Agency is ready to utilise fully its mandate and tasks to act in the areas outlined. The package proposes amongst many things, the review of the Network and Information Services (NIS) Directive, a new Critical Entities Resilience (CER) Directive, a network of Security Operations Centres (SOCs) and new measures to strengthen the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox. The package also includes a report on the impact of the Commission Recommendation on the Cybersecurity of 5G networks, which ENISA supported together with EU Member States. Executive Director of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity Juhan Lepassaar said: “The security of cyberspace has been tested globally in recent times therefore the new cybersecurity strategy is very timely. The proposed framework addresses new sectors and puts in motion recommendations that have also been advocated by the Agency and we look forward to contributing to making this new vision a reality.” Reviewing the legislative framework: NIS2 The COVID-19 pandemic has more than confirmed the importance of preparing Europe for the digital decade as well as the need to continuously improve cyber resilience particularly for those who operate essential services such as healthcare, energy but also those who provide online marketplace services. The proposed expansion of scope under the NIS Directive (NIS2), in which more entities are obliged to take measures would assist in increasing the level of cybersecurity in Europe. A recent ENISA study on NIS Investments showed that for organisations implementing the NIS Directive “Unclear expectations” (35%)  and “Limited support from the national authority” (22%) were among the challenges faced. The proposed review of the NIS Directive addresses these areas, aiming to provide more clarity towards what is expected from the national authorities, computer security incident response team (CSIRTs) and essential and important entities in terms of reporting, crisis management framework and information sharing. The EU Cybersecurity Strategy sets goals, which will impact the Agency’s work both directly and indirectly. We see a number of new elements including the domain name dystem resolution and diversification strategy (DNS4EU) as well as the building of a network of SOCs.

ENISA_NEWS_0073	2020-12-17	NEWS	Cybersecurity in the Maritime Sector: ENISA Releases New Guidelines for Navigating Cyber Risk 	 Today, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) released cybersecurity guidelines to help European port operators manage cyber risks amid digital transformation and increased regulations. ENISA’s new Guidelines - Cyber Risk Management for Ports was drafted in collaboration with several ports in EU Member States. The publication builds on ENISA’s 2019 Port Cybersecurity Report by providing actionable practices that speak to the current cybersecurity threats and changing digital landscape faced by Europe’s maritime sector. EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar stated: “The maritime sector plays a pivotal role in the global supply chain. Advancing digital technologies bring economic benefits to ports, but also introduce new cyber threats. The report provides guidelines and good practices to support them in effectively conducting this cyber risk assessment, which is where many of these operators face challenges.” The interconnected nature of ports requires operators to achieve and maintain a baseline level of cybersecurity to ensure security across the port ecosystem. The report notes that the EU maritime sector has a fragmented approach to assessing cyber risks. The report encourages port operators to develop a set of good practices in a means to develop this baseline level of cybersecurity. Practices include to: Identify cyber-related assets and services in a systematic way that includes maintaining an asset inventory, identifying dependencies and deploying automation; Adopt a comprehensive approach for identifying and evaluating cyber risks that includes CTI, risk indicators and business impact analysis, involves all relevant stakeholders and is integrated at an organisational level; Prioritise the implementation of security measures following a risk-based approach that considers security measure effectiveness and pertinence to the identified risks, and is founded in a security-by-design approach; Implement organisation-wide cybersecurity awareness and technical training programmes; Develop a comprehensive cybersecurity programme that involves a commitment by senior management; Conduct a cybersecurity maturity self-assessment to identify priorities for improvement, and budget and resource allocation. Background The NIS Directive classifies several categories of port operators as Operators of Essential Services (OES), including port authorities and terminal operators. Cyber risk assessments are among the NIS Directive requirements for these OES. The International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) code concerns port facilities / terminal operators and provides a framework for conducting security risk assessment, albeit not necessarily specific to cyber risks. The ISPS code is implemented in the EU by Regulation 725/2004; while EU Directive 2005/65 on enhancing port security introduces similar requirements and extends them to ports. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity supports cybersecurity in Europe’s maritime sector by providing recommendations, supporting the development of regulations, facilitating information exchange and organising awareness-raising events. In 2019, the Agency published its Port Cybersecurity Report with a set of cybersecurity good practices for the maritime sector, and organised two maritime security workshops with the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). The Agency is currently developing an online tool for cyber risk management for port operators, and will continue its work with EU bodies, such as the EMSA, and Member States to strengthen cybersecurity for the sector.

ENISA_PR_0074	2020-12-15	PR	ENISA AI Threat Landscape Report Unveils Major Cybersecurity Challenges	 Today, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) released its Artificial Intelligence Threat Landscape Report, unveiling the major cybersecurity challenges facing the AI ecosystem. ENISA’s study takes a methodological approach at mapping the key players and threats in AI. The report follows up the priorities defined in the European Commission’s 2020 AI White Paper. The ENISA Ad-Hoc Working Group on Artificial Intelligence Cybersecurity, with members from EU Institutions, academia and industry, provided input and supported the drafting of this report.   The benefits of this emerging technology are significant, but so are the concerns, such as potential new avenues of manipulation and attack methods. The technology takes many steps across the supply chain and requires vast amounts of data to function efficiently. The AI Threat Landscape report underlines the importance of cybersecurity and data protection in every part of the AI ecosystem to create trustworthy technology for end-users. Executive Director of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity Juhan Lepassaar said: “Cybersecurity is one of the bases of trustworthy solutions for Artificial Intelligence. A common understanding of AI cybersecurity threats will be key to Europe’s widespread deployment and acceptance of AI systems and applications.” This new work by ENISA aims to serve as a baseline for initiatives to secure AI: both in terms of policies, as it frames the problem and provides guidance on cybersecurity threats, as well as in terms of technical controls, as it highlights specific threats for which action may be needed. The report is directed to policy makers when developing future guidance on secure AI deployments, to technical experts to support customised risk assessments and to standardisation bodies to support upcoming AI security standards. The main highlights of the report include: Definition of AI’s scope in the context of cybersecurity by following a lifecycle approach. The ecosystem of AI systems and applications is defined by taking into account the different stages of the AI lifecycle -- from requirements analysis to deployment. Identification of assets of the AI ecosystem as a fundamental step in pinpointing what needs to be protected and what could possibly go wrong in terms of the security of the AI ecosystem. Mapping of the AI threat landscape by means of a detailed taxonomy. This serves as a baseline for the identification of potential vulnerabilities and attack scenarios for specific use cases.   Classification of threats and listing of relevant threat actors. The impact of threats to different security properties is also highlighted. The ENISA AI Threat Landscape identifies the challenges and opportunities to deploy secure AI systems and services across the Union. The report highlights the need for more targeted and proportionate security measures to mitigate the identified threats, as well as the need for an in-depth look into AI’s use in sectors such as health, automotive and finance.   Background The EU Agency for Cybersecurity continues to play a bigger role in the assessment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by providing key input for future policies. Earlier this year, the Agency set up the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group on Cybersecurity for Artificial Intelligence, which supports ENISA in the process of building knowledge on AI Cybersecurity. The group includes members from the European Commission Directorate-General Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT), the European Commission Directorate-General Joint Research Committee (DG JRC), Europol, the European Defence Agency (EDA), the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA), the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), as well as academics and industry experts.   On the 30th of September 2020, Member of European Parliament Eva Kaili and ENISA co-hosted the Cybersecurity for Artificial Intelligence (C4AI) virtual workshop to explore the security challenges related to AI. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity plans to continue in 2021 its open dialogue with the European Commission and EU Institutions on AI cybersecurity and regulatory initiatives. Additionally, the Agency will come up with mitigation controls for the identified threats and publish relevant guidelines.

ENISA_PR_0075	2020-12-14	PR	Updated ENISA 5G Threat Landscape Report to Enhance 5G Security	 Today, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) published an updated version of its 5G threat assessment report to address advancements in the areas of fifth generation of mobile telecommunications networks (5G) and to contribute to the implementation of the EU 5G toolbox cybersecurity risk mitigating measures. The new ENISA Threat Landscape for 5G Networks report is a major update of the previous edition as it captures recent developments in 5G standardisation. The publication includes a vulnerability analysis, which examines the exposure of 5G components. The analysis explores how cyber threats can exploit vulnerabilities and how technical security controls can help mitigate risks. European Union Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar explained: “By providing regular threat assessments, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity materialises its support to the EU cybersecurity ecosystem.  This work is part of our continuous contribution to securing 5G, a key infrastructure for the years to come.” The New Threat Landscape includes: An updated system architecture of 5G, indicating introduced novelties and assessed security considerations; A detailed vulnerability analysis of all relevant 5G assets, including their exposure to threats; A mapping of related security controls aiming at the reduction of threat surface; An update of the relevant threats in accordance with their exploitation potential of the assessed vulnerabilities; The consideration of implementation options – migration paths from 4G to 5G infrastructures; The development of a process map showing the contribution of operational, life cycle and security assurance processes to the overall security of 5G infrastructures; A new inventory of critical components. The information produced for this report is based on publicly available content published by 5G market players (operators, vendors, and national and international organisations), standardisation groups and bodies (for example: 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP); International Telecommunications Union (ITU); European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute (ETSI); International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO); the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA)). Backgrounds In November 2019, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, with support of the EU Member States, the European Commission and experts, published the first 5G Threat Landscape, assessing the threats related to 5G. One month prior, EU Member States published the EU-wide Coordinated Risk Assessment of 5G networks, which contains 10 high-level risk scenarios, based on the national risk assessments by Member States. The ENISA 5G Threat Landscape complements the Coordinated Risk Assessment with a more technical and more detailed view of the 5G architecture, the assets and the cyber threats for those assets. This year’s update goes one step further with a dedicated vulnerability assessment and input on the current status of 5G. The Agency will continue engaging on cybersecurity activities of 5G. Coordination with EU-wide activities will be key to the success of secure European 5G practices. Upcoming Event on the 21st December: The EU Agency for Cybersecurity and the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) are organising a joint workshop on the 21st of December to discuss the implementation of the EU 5G toolbox.

ENISA_PR_0076	2020-12-11	PR	NIS Directive has Positive Effect, though Study Finds Gaps in Cybersecurity Investment Exist	 Today, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) released a new report on information security spending for network and information services (NIS) under the NIS Directive, the first EU-wide legislation on cybersecurity. The NIS Investments report is based on a survey of 251 organisations of operators of essential services (OES) and digital service providers (DSP) from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Poland. Eighty-two percent of those surveyed reported the NIS Directive had a positive effect on their information security. NIS Directive Implementation The report provides input to the European Commission’s review of the NIS Directive on the 16th of December, four years after the Directive entered into force and two years after the transposition into national law.    Challenges remain after the implementation of the Directive -- the lack of clarity of the NIS Directive expectations after transposition into national law was a common issue. More than 35% of organisations surveyed believe the NIS Directive expectations are unclear. Twenty-two percent of respondents listed limited support from national authorities as one of their top challenges when implementing the Directive. Cybersecurity Investments: EU vs. US When comparing organisations from the EU to organisations from the United States, the study shows that EU organisations allocate on average 41% less to information security than their US counterparts. The Executive Director of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, Juhan Lepassaar, said: “This data indicates that the NIS Directive has been a great tool to drive investments, but recognises that certain gaps still exist, and a clearer strategic framework and more elaborated approach is needed. The review of the NIS Directive is timely and can therefore address these challenges -- building a stronger network and information security framework.” New and unique data on EU information security in the NIS Investment report: Has your organisation established (or planned) a dedicated program or project(s) to implement the NIS Directive?   What are the estimated damages incurred by the last major security incident(s) experienced by your organisation?  Key findings about the NIS Directive implementation in the NIS Investment report The average budget for NIS Directive implementation projects is approximately €175k, with 42.7% of affected organisations allocating between €100k and €250k. Slightly less than 50% of surveyed organisations had to hire additional security matter experts. Surveyed organisations prioritised the following security domains: Governance, Risk & Compliance and Network Security. When implementing the NIS Directive, 64% of surveyed organisations procured security incident & event log collection solutions, as well as security awareness & training services. “Unclear expectations” (35%)  and “Limited support from the national authority” (22%) are among the top challenges faced by surveyed organisations when implementing the NIS Directive. 81% of the surveyed organisations have established a mechanism to report information security incidents to their national authority. 43% of surveyed organisations experienced information security incidents with a direct financial impact to up to €500k, while 15% experienced incidents with over half a million euro. Background The NIS Directive represents the first EU-wide legislation on cybersecurity, with the objective to achieve a high common level of cybersecurity across all EU Member States. One of the three pillars of the NIS Directive is the implementation of risk management and reporting obligations for Operators of Essential Services (OES) and Digital Service Providers (DSP). OES provide essential services in strategic sectors of energy (electricity, oil and gas), transport (air, rail, water and road), banking, financial market infrastructures, health, drinking water supply and distribution, and digital infrastructure (Internet exchange points, domain name system service providers, top-level domain name registries). DSP operate in an online environment, namely online marketplaces, online search engines and cloud computing services.

The publication is an update of the 2014 ENISA Technical Guideline on Security Measures under Article 13a of the EU Telecoms Framework Directive. It provides non-binding technical guidance to telecom security authorities about the security supervision required by Articles 40 and 41 of the EECC. Article 40 of the EECC contains detailed security requirements for electronic communication providers, and Article 41 empowers competent authorities with respect to the implementation and enforcement of these requirements. EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar said: “With the transposition of the European Electronic Communications Code approaching, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity has published new guidelines for national telecom security authorities, which aim to achieve a common high level of communications security for telecom providers and network operators in the EU.” More specifically, the Guideline on Security Measures Under the EECC report contains 29 high-level security objectives listed under eight security domains (governance and risk management; human resources security; security of systems and facilities; operations management; incident management; business continuity management; monitoring, auditing and testing; threat awareness). The report also provides detailed security measures organised into three levels of increasing sophistication (basic; industry standard; state-of-the-art). Each security measure includes examples of evidence to help assess if the measures are in place. Figure: Overall structure of the security objectives and security measures   The 5G Supplement provides national authorities with a guide to ensure the security of their 5G networks and services. The publication offers an additional step to the guideline by providing authorities with 70 proposed checks for 5G when implementing a measure or when checking the guideline’s evidence. The supplement focuses on the cybersecurity of 5G networks at the policy level stemming from the EU 5G toolbox, and includes additional information and references at the technical level for new technologies, such as virtualisation, slicing and edge computing. The guideline and the 5G supplement were drafted in close collaboration with the ECASEC expert group of national telecom security authorities and in line with the work stream on 5G cybersecurity under the NIS Cooperation Group. Background The European Electronic Communication Code (EECC) replaces the existing EU Telecoms Framework Directive and brings significant changes in the security supervision of electronic communication services. The EECC requires EU Member States to implement the new rules by 21 December 2020. Established in 2010, the ECASEC Expert Group (formerly the Article 13a Expert Group) consists of more than 50 experts from national telecom security authorities from 31 EU, EFTA and EU candidate countries, who supervise the security of telecom networks and services. The expert group produces technical guidelines for European authorities on the implementation of EU telecom security rules and publishes a summary report about major telecom security incidents yearly.

ENISA_NEWS_0078	2020-12-10	NEWS	Driving the Global Ecosystem of Incident Response Capabilities: New Studies Now Available	 The 12th meeting of the CSIRTs Network, held earlier this week, was the opportunity for the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity to introduce the following two new guides dedicated to improving the work of incident response teams: How to set up CSIRT and SOC - Good Practice Guide Sectoral CSIRT capabilities - Status and Development in the Energy and the Air Transport sector The event, hosted by the German Presidency of the Council of the European Union, gathered together CSIRTs Network Members (EU Member States’ appointed CSIRTs and CERT-EU ) to discuss operational cooperation capabilities in the EU as defined by the Network and Information Security Directive. The role of the CSIRTs Network is to provide a forum where the national and sectoral CSIRTs of all Member States and CERT-EU can cooperate, exchange information, and work on how to build trust. They are dedicated to the improvement of the way cross-border incidents are handled and how to respond in a coordinated manner to specific incidents. ENISA provides the secretariat of the CSIRTs Network and actively supports the cooperation between the members of the network and the organisation of their meetings. What are the studies intended for? Both studies are intended for incident response teams. The first one was conducted to investigate ways on how to establish and improve teams. The second one focusses on trends in Energy and Air Transport Incident Response (IR) and offers insights on current challenges and gaps. How to set up CSIRT and SOC - Good Practice Guide Cybersecurity threats are increasing and becoming more complex. One of the most effective ways to counter these threats is by creating a global ecosystem of computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) and security operations centres (SOCs). The purpose of this ecosystem is to facilitate communication, the sharing of information in order to respond to cyber-threats effectively. This can be achieved by providing relevant frameworks while increasing the number of CSIRTs and SOCs around the world and developing the maturity of existing CSIRTs and SOCs. ENISA is assisting EU Member States with their incident response capabilities by providing them with various resources, such as documents, tools, materials and guidance. More than 40 teams from all over the world contributed to the content of the study. Methodology The study developed on a results-driven approach. It is presented with a structure meant to provide guidance on the different stages of the establishment of a CSIRT or SOC organization. The reader will be guided on what to focus on at each stage of the process such as establishment and improvement. This publication will be of specific interest to those who intend to establish a CSIRT or SOC. It will also help those looking for guidance on possible improvements according to the different types of CSIRTs and SOCs already created and functioning today. The guide builds on the existing work of ENISA, especially in the areas of maturity and training. Sectoral CSIRT capabilities - Status and Development in the Energy and the Air Transport sector Digital infrastructure, Information and Communication Technologies are critical to our societies and economies. Both Energy and Air Transport sectors face considerable threats with potentially disastrous financial and societal consequences. This is why they require solid Incident Response Capabilities (IRC). Both sectors come with large supply chains and a multiplicity of stakeholders (Public authorities, Regulators, Professional associations, large industries, SMEs, etc.). They have, in recent years, taken steps to structure and strengthen their ability to face cyber threats and to respond to cyber incidents. The creation of ISACs to encourage information-sharing at the sectoral level is an excellent illustration of this evolution. Context and scope of the study This publication provides a continuation of the work on Sectoral IRC at European level following the publication of the 2019 “EU Member States incident response development status report”. By providing an extensive analysis of the recent changes and evolutions of IR capabilities (IRC) within Air Transport and Energy sectors in the Member States, the study aims to increase the understanding and knowledge of IRC development under today’s circumstances. To that effect, the study was conducted in the light of the recent changes related to the Covid-19 pandemic and in the context of the upcoming revision of the NIS Directive. Recommendations The study is presented as a snapshot of the current situation in the area. General recommendations are provided around capabilities, regulations and collaboration. In particular, The study highlights a total of eight key findings on topics like establishment and organization of sectorial CSIRTs, specific services and competencies offered by such CSIRTs, tools and information sharing mechanisms used as well as challenges faced.

ENISA_NEWS_0081	2020-11-26	NEWS	ENISA Report Highlights Resilience of Telecom Sector in Facing the Pandemic	 Today, at the 32nd meeting of EU telecom security authorities, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) is releasing its Telecom Security During a Pandemic report, which gives an overview of initiatives and good practices in the telecom sector to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. The report highlights the resiliency of telecom networks and services during the pandemic, which sustained major fluctuations in usage and traffic. The report also points to the need for increased cooperation between the public and private sectors as the role of telecoms expands.  The COVID-19 pandemic triggered major changes in the use of telecom networks and services: employees are teleworking; students are learning online; people are communicating via video. Almost overnight, the telecoms sector became a lifeline for Europe’s citizens and businesses. The pandemic put the telecom sector to the test with traffic peaks and spikes, combined with a national crisis and difficult working circumstances. Peaks followed major announcements about the pandemic; spikes occurred after news of lockdowns and closures. The diagram below shows the correlation between COVID-19 cases and fluctuations in network traffic on a single timeline. This is an example of one provider in one EU country, but it is representative of what other operators in Europe observed.  Figure: A schema of the volume of traffic on the telecommunications networks as the pandemic evolved (Source: Fastly) The report is divided in three parts: Early response phase: The report assesses the steps taken by telecom providers in the early response phase when providers activated their business continuity plans and supported emergency communications and communications via public warning systems.  From initial strain to the new normal: Telecom providers had to deal with major surges and shifts in usage and in traffic patterns from the start of the pandemic. Gradually, this stabilised and became “the new normal”. The report examines the changes in usage, traffic patterns and network performance during the pandemic, and provides various examples of how providers managed the increased network loads.  Response by the national authorities and collaboration with the telecom sector: The report provides a brief country-by-country summary of the pandemic response by the national telecom security authorities in the Union. It also highlights examples of industry initiatives, collaboration initiatives and information sharing between providers and authorities. About the ECASEC Meeting (32nd Meeting of the Article 13a Expert Group) On the 25th of November, the EU telecom security authorities expert group kicked off a two-day meeting with the European Commission and the EU Agency for Cybersecurity to exchange information and good practices on telecom security. This 32nd meeting focuses on the implementation of the Electronic European Communications Code (EECC), which EU Member States will need to adopt into their telecom regulations before the end of 2020.   The group is chaired by Warna Munzebrock, the representative of the Agentschap Telecom, the Dutch Radio-communications Agency. Ms Munzebrock opened yesterday’s meeting by welcoming experts from across Europe. The authorities also voted to change the name of the group from the ENISA Article 13a Expert Group to ECASEC (European Competent Authorities for Secure Electronic Communication), due to the upcoming regulatory changes.  Participants discussed the incident reporting thresholds under the new Electronic European Communications Code (EECC).

ENISA_NEWS_0083	2020-11-20	NEWS	Deep Dive into the Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM) Ecosystem: New Report	 The Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM) sector is a whole ecosystem of services, operations and infrastructures formed by a wide variety of actors and stakeholders. This ecosystem not only generates transformation in the industries but also considers how to meet the needs of the citizens for safer, cyber secure, increased sustainability, and for easier transportation. CAM has the potential to change the way society perceives transportation. This sector is meant to highly benefit from digitalisation allowing vehicles to be connected with their surroundings and the drivers. Solving congestion, reducing pollution, decreasing the number of road accidents, and improving access to mobility are the substantial advantages society is intended to enjoy. In order to achieve such results, however, cybersecurity plays a crucial role in the evolution of the CAM ecosystem. The increase in connectivity and automation of vehicles and surrounding infrastructures is taking cybersecurity challenges, threats, and risks to a higher level. The CAM ecosystem requires stakeholders to ensure compliance with cybersecurity standards and the implementation of cybersecurity measures for the safe functioning of the infrastructures involved and for the secure monitoring and delivery of services. How the EU policy framework comes into play today In the light of such developments, the European Commission and Member States competent authorities are about to transpose into EU policy the provisions of the regulations of cybersecurity and software updates of the United Nations adopted by the World Forum of Harmonisation of Vehicle Regulations (WP.29) of the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). Such provisions take into account the needs of all CAM stakeholders. The regulation requires all car manufacturers in the EU to secure connected vehicles against cyberattacks. This regulation is expected to enter into force in Europe from July 2022 and will be mandatory for all new types of vehicle. What is the report focused on The report published today provides an in-depth mapping of the key stakeholders and relevant bodies and organisations in the EU. It includes an overview of the relevant critical services, systems and infrastructures part of the CAM cybersecurity ecosystem (see also CAMsystems and infrastructures mapping infographic). The findings complement the key cybersecurity challenges of the CAM stakeholders already identified in the Recommendations for the Security of Connected and Automated Mobility report to be published soon by ENISA. ENISA Report - Cybersecurity Stocktaking in the CAM Target audience The report is intended to support the work of the European Commission and the Member States competent authorities in the transposition of the UN cybersecurity regulation into EU policy. Decision-makers who are responsible for the protection of security and resilience of the CAM ecosystem at EU level will find in the report the relevant cybersecurity measures and key issues they need to consider to draft their cybersecurity baseline. The report is also expected to be of particular interest to Operators of Intelligent Transport Systems (OITS), Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), Road Authorities (RA), Smart City Operators and standardisation bodies among others. Further Information ENISA is already engaged in the cybersecurity of smart cars and intelligent transport systems and issued publications of existing standardisation, legislative and policy initiatives, as well as good practices and security measures to ensure the security of smart cars against cyber threats.

ENISA_NEWS_0085	2020-11-18	NEWS	Healthcare’s Cybersecurity Incident Response Spotlighted at European Security Event	 On the 23rd of November, part three of the eHealth Security Conference 2020: Working Together Towards Secure eHeath will kick off with talks about healthcare’s cybersecurity incident response in Europe. The session, Incident Response While in Crisis, will highlight actual events fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic. It will examine how the private and public sectors are supporting the system at EU Member State level, and how information exchange across communities is working to advance the preparedness of healthcare across Europe. While under normal circumstances healthcare has been a target of cybercrime due to the high value of health data and the criticality of health services, now more than ever it has become a target for malicious actors, who have introduced more advanced phishing campaigns and ransomware attacks since the onset of the pandemic. As Europe’s health system is being pushed to the limit, responding to cyber attacks has become an almost insurmountable challenge to face. The cybersecurity community has come together to raise awareness and offer real solutions to help prepare healthcare providers.   The Danish Health Data Authority and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) redesigned the eHealth Security Conference this year to focus on three areas of healthcare’s most pressing cyber challenges with deep-dive sessions across three months. The first session held in September focused on cybersecurity in healthcare during the pandemic; and the second session held last month covered cybersecurity for COVID-19 tracing mobile apps. The final session will be in a virtual format, and will be accessible to the public for live viewing on 23 November at 14:00-16:00 CET here: ENISA YouTube channel. EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar will open the session with a keynote speech centred on building up cyber resiliency across Europe’s health system. The two-hour session will review how the system has responded to incidents over the past months and analyse how some of the key lessons learned have been translated into actions to push forward this cyber resiliency. Security and healthcare experts from the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions, Bodies and Agencies (CERT-EU), the Netherlands healthcare CERT (Z-CERT), the Institut Luxembourgeois de Regulation (ILR) and the Danish Healthcare Cyber and Information Security Unit (DCIS) will share recommendations for the technical aspects of incident responses. Highlights of Session II - “Cybersecurity in COVID-19 Tracing Mobile Apps” Last month’s session on Cybersecurity in COVID-19 tracing mobile apps found that governments are capable of creating country-scale apps that put privacy and security as the top requirements. Christian D’Cunha, Policy Officer at DG Connect, European Commission opened talks with a keynote about the mid-term appraisal of COVID-19 apps, six months on. He noted that most Member States have launched or are preparing to launch their national apps for contact tracing - indicating a high level of convergence at EU level. He also summarised the activities around the European Federation Gateway Service (EFGS), which will enable encrypted information exchange between national applications. Moderated by Dr. Evangelos Ouzounis, Head of the Secure Infrastructure and Services Unit at the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, session panellists discussed how these apps work to complement physical tracing in a secure manner. Representing the Danish Patient Safety Authority, Birgitte Drewes noted that in Denmark the app was created primarily to complement the physical tracing process and aims to have a fully anonymous functionality, as the data is stored entirely on the device itself. Dr. Dina Truxius of Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) discussed how the BSI conducted the entire security assessment and focused on continuously performing testing on the front and the backend. Advisor to the President of Latvia Ieva Ilves presented the Latvian framework, and underlined the importance of raising awareness of the national COVID-19 tracing and warning app. Expert for the Dutch Ministry of Health Dirk-Willem van Gulik highlighted the initial challenges of producing the Dutch app, which is now a fully open source app built up on a decentralised architecture. Background The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity has been actively supporting the healthcare sector since 2015. The Agency has published several reports about cybersecurity in healthcare, including Security and Resilience in eHealth Infrastructures and Services, Cybersecurity and Resilience for Smart Hospitals and Procurement Guidelines for Cybersecurity in Hospitals. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity is currently working on a report about cloud cybersecurity in healthcare for January 2021. The report aims to tackle the issue that cloud integration in the EU healthcare sector is still in its infancy by proposing 17 security and data protection measures to ensure cloud security. The Agency also works in close collaboration with Member State national authorities and healthcare organisations on the implementation of the NIS Directive. During the pandemic, the NIS Cooperation Group focused greatly on the implementation of the NIS Directive in healthcare. Another area in which the Agency collaborates is with the eHealth Network established under the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE), which works towards the cross-border exchange of healthcare information and services, and with the Joint Action to Support the eHealth Network (JAseHN). For example, the Agency supported the drafting of cybersecurity guidelines for COVID-19 tracing apps. Moreover, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity participates in the Medical Device Coordination Group, which produced the guidance on cybersecurity for medical devices in the context of the Medical Devices Regulation under the European Commission's Directorate-General for the Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship & SMEs (DG GROW).

ENISA_PR_0086	2020-11-13	PR	European Rail: Report unveils challenges and stresses the need for investment in cybersecurity	 Today, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) is releasing its Cybersecurity in Railways report at the joint ENISA and European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) webinar to bring awareness to the most pressing cybersecurity challenges facing Europe’s rail sector. The report identifies the current cybersecurity status and challenges, and provides an analysis of the sector’s regulatory context. According to the report, the sector needs enhanced cybersecurity measures to combat challenges and move ahead smoothly. The ENISA publication is based on input gathered over the past two years from operators of essential rail services from 21 EU Member States. ENISA and the ERA are co-organising today’s webinar to present the Agencies’ joint activities and to stress the importance of cybersecurity to railway stakeholders as they face a complex regulatory system that requires a deep understanding of operational cybersecurity actions. In addition, European rail is undergoing a major transformation of its operations, systems and infrastructure due to digitisation, mass transit and increasing interconnections. This has led to the reallocation of responsibilities, and the separation of railway systems and infrastructure, which both affect the sector’s IT systems and require cybersecurity capabilities. The implementation of these cybersecurity requirements is fundamental for the sector’s digital enhancement and security. ENISA’s Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar and ERA’s Executive Director Josef Doppelbauer will open the event with keynote speeches focusing on the importance of streamlined actions to enhance cybersecurity and capacity building for the rail sector. This webinar is a first step in the Agencies’ collaboration to boost cybersecurity in the European rail sector. A joint conference is scheduled for March 2021. Today’s webinar is being held virtually at 10:00-11:00 a.m. CET. More can be found on the ERA event page: Free webinar: Cybersecurity in Railways. Mr.  Juhan Lepassaar, Executive Director of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, stated: “Europe’s rail sector is at the crossroads of digitalisation. Cooperation among all stakeholders, public and private, is one step to tackle the sector’s challenges and protect our core infrastructure, a step in the right direction for the implementation of NIS Directive and a digitally secure Europe.” The Cybersecurity in Railways report assesses the implementation in Member States of the Networks and Information Security Directive (NIS Directive), the first EU-wide cybersecurity legislation working to enhance cybersecurity across the Union. The ENISA publication points to the numerous challenges cited by operators of essential services when enforcing the NIS Directive, including: an overall lack of cybersecurity awareness in the sector and challenges of operational technology; a strong dependency on the supply chain; the presence of legacy systems; complexities due to the high number of systems to be secured and managed; conflicts between safety and security mind-sets. The report also emphasises the need to find the right balance between cybersecurity, competitiveness and operational efficiency. Background Information The EU Agency for Cybersecurity plays a major role in the implementation of the NIS Directive by supporting Member States and the private sector in achieving a higher level of cybersecurity through the ENISA annual work programme. Over the years, the Agency has collaborated closely with railway undertakings and infrastructure managers on the implementation of the NIS Directive, as well as with the ERA on cybersecurity for the European Rail Traffic Management System. The Agency also supports the European Railway Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ER-ISAC) and offers expertise in the CEN CENELEC technical committee on Technical Specifications for Rail. Last year, the Agency teamed up with the ERA, the European Commission (DG MOVE), the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) to produce the first Transportation Cybersecurity Conference, where international organisations, private industry, regulators, academia, and the management of EU Decentralised Agencies and the European Commission highlighted the need for increased cybersecurity across Europe’s transportation sector.

ENISA_PR_0087	2020-11-09	PR	IoT Security: ENISA Publishes Guidelines on Securing the IoT Supply Chain 	 Today, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) is releasing its Guidelines for Securing the IoT – Secure Supply Chain for IoT, which covers the entire Internet of Things (IoT) supply chain – hardware, software and services – and builds on the 2019 Good Practices for Security of IoT - Secure Software Development Lifecycle publication by focusing on the actual processes of the supply chain used to develop IoT products. This report complements the Agency’s seminal study on Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT, a highly cited and referenced work that aims to serve as a reference point for IoT security. Supply chains are currently facing a broad range of threats, from physical threats to cybersecurity threats. Organisations are becoming more dependent than ever before on third parties. As organisations cannot always control the security measures of their supply chain partners, IoT supply chains have become a weak link for cybersecurity. Today, organisations have less visibility and understanding of how the technology they acquire is developed, integrated and deployed than ever before. EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar stated: “Securing the supply chain of ICT products and services should be a prerequisite for their further adoption particularly for critical infrastructure and services. Only then can we reap the benefits associated with their widespread deployment, as it happens with IoT.“ In the context of the development of the Guidelines for Securing the IoT – Secure Supply Chain for IoT, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity has conducted a survey that identifies the existence of untrusted third-party components and vendors, and the vulnerability management of third-party components as the two main threats to the IoT supply chain. The publication analyses the different stages of the development process, explores the most important security considerations, identifies good practices to be taken into account at each stage, and offers readers additional resources from other initiatives, standards and guidelines. As in most cases pre-prepared products are used to build up an IoT solution, introducing the concept of security by design and security by default is a fundamental building block to protect this emerging technology. The Agency has worked with IoT experts to create specific security guidelines for the whole lifespan of IoT devices. These guidelines to help tackle the complexity of IoT focus on bringing together the key actors in the supply chain to adopt a comprehensive approach to security, leverage existing standards and implement security by design principles. ENISA’s Work in IoT The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity has been working on good practices for securing IoT since 2016 by publishing studies that map the corresponding threat landscape and provide targeted security measures. The Agency’s key publications in this arena include Good Practices for Security of IoT - Secure Software Development Lifecycle, Industry 4.0 in the Context of Smart Manufacturing, Smart Cars, Smart Hospitals, Smart Airports, and a dedicated online tool: Online Tool - Good practices for IoT and Smart Infrastructures Just last month, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, Europol’s Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions, Bodies and Agencies (CERT-EU) launched the 4th Annual IoT Security Conference Series to raise awareness on the security challenges facing the IoT ecosystem across the Union. The conference opened discussions into the trustworthiness of IoT with topics about supply chain integrity, AI deployments, regulations surrounding IoT, and possible cybersecurity certification schemes that could support this effort.

ENISA_NEWS_0088	2020-10-26	NEWS	EU Agency for Cybersecurity launches ISAC in a BOX Toolkit	 European legislation, such as the Cybersecurity Act and the NIS Directive (NISD), promotes the creation of European and National Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs). ISACs are private public partnerships (PPPs) between stakeholders exposed to similar cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats and they are usually formed by private sector initiative, in particular operators of essential services of the critical sectors. ISACs collect, analyse and disseminate actionable threat information to their members and provide them with tools to mitigate risks and enhance resilience. ENISA’s task is to support the creation and development of ISACs and advise them to strengthen their cooperation, build trust and exchange information using tools and mechanisms that are beneficial for all parties. ENISA participates and offers advice and expertise in several European initiatives regarding the development of ISACs through: Connecting Europe Facilities (CEF) call for ISACs as a technical advisor; Inter-EU ISAC platform as a facilitator; European Energy (EE) ISAC as a member; European Financial (FI) ISAC as secretariat; European Maritime (EM) ISAC as a member; European Rail (ER) ISAC as a member. More information can be found in the Infographic – Benefits of an ISAC Objective and description of the toolkit                                                  ENISA developed this comprehensive toolkit, following studies on the ISAC concept, to address the need to facilitate community building and collaboration across ISACs. The toolkit aims at providing practical guidance and the means to empower industry to create new ISACs and to further develop already existing ones.              The main success factors for ISACs are Trust and Sharing. If there is trust, information will be shared and added value will be created - ISAC in a BOX follows the same approach. It is divided in four phases and contains all activities, documents and tools needed to start, develop and evaluate an ISAC. Each phase includes the basic elements that need to be fulfilled to go to the next phase. Build phase: It’s all about setting the goals, participants and purpose for the ISAC; agreeing on the budget and the right cooperation mechanisms. Run phase: Governance is key to share information through meetings and develop trust and building capacities among the ISAC participants. Evaluation phase: Evaluation is an essential part of the ISAC lifecycle which helps to keep it on track, measure its impact and assess its momentum in order to bring it to the next phase. Develop phase: Time for action! This phase focuses on enhancing ISAC’s sophistication, its further development and outreach strategies.

ENISA_PR_0089	2020-10-23	PR	Annual Privacy Forum 2020: Policy and Research Unite to Advance Security of Personal Data	 On 22-23 of October, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the European Commission and the Catolica University of Portugal (UCP), with support of the Portuguese Data Protection Authority (CNPD), co-organised the 8th Annual Privacy Forum (APF), a renowned event focused on bridging the gap between policy and research in the area of privacy and data protection. The year’s event recorded more than 500 participants and was held in a virtual format. The value of personal data in a digital environment has grown significantly over the last years as electronic products, services and processes have become more integral to everyday life. Limitations in the transparency, the functionality and interconnectivity of online and communication services increase the risk of having personal data processed without the required safeguards and level of protection. The EU legal framework on privacy and data protection (the General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive) aims to better control the processing of personal data while ensuring an adequate level of protection. A key element for personal data protection is the proper use of security measures and privacy enhancing technologies as they offer practical protection mechanisms and support the application of legal provisions. EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar said: “In today’s data-driven world, cybersecurity and data protection should be considered as complementary components impacting the entire lifecycle of electronic products, services or processes.” This year’s APF opened with welcome speeches by Acting Director of Directorate CNECT H, Digital Society, Trust and Cybersecurity Jakub Boratyński and UCP School of Law Dean Jorge Pereira da Silva. On day one, European Data Protection Supervisor Wojciech Wiewiórowski; Deputy Chair of the European Data Protection Board Ventsislav Karadjov; and President of Portuguese Data Protection Authority Filipa Calvão presented keynote talks around the topic of ‘Crossroads of Privacy and Technology’. This two-day event brought together policy-makers, data protection practitioners, researchers and industry experts to discuss the latest advancements in tracking and the practical implementation of de-identification, as well as research work in the areas of impact assessment, transparency, security and privacy by design. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity has been working for several years on technical aspects in the areas of privacy and data protection.The Agency has contributed to bridging the gap between the legal framework and the available technical measures by providing an inventory of existing approaches, privacy by design strategies and technical building blocks, such as pseudonymisation and encryption. In an effort to support organisations and especially Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), the Agency has also proposed a risk-based approach for the adoption of security measures for the protection of personal data. Pursuant to the EU Cybersecurity Act provisions, the Agency is seeking to contribute further to the implementation of specific cybersecurity aspects, while promoting the exchange of know-how and best practices. Background The Annual Privacy Forum (APF) has become a renowned forum among policy-makers, researchers and industry stakeholders in the area of privacy and personal data protection who join forces to advance information security. The forum is set against the EU legislative background that is mainly, but not exclusively, comprised of the GDPR and the draft ePrivacy Regulation. The event sets the stage for new research proposals, solutions, models, applications and policies. In the last few years, the forum has also developed a deeper industry footprint to complement its original research and policy orientation. The 9th Annual Privacy Forum is scheduled to take place in June 2021 in Olso, Norway, in co-operation with University of Oslo.

ENISA_PR_0090	2020-10-20	PR	ENISA Threat Landscape 2020: Cyber Attacks Becoming More Sophisticated, Targeted, Widespread and Undetected	 Today, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), with the support of the European Commission, EU Member States and the CTI Stakeholders Group, has published the 8th annual ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) 2020 report, identifying and evaluating the top cyber threats for the period January 2019-April 2020. This year’s publication is divided into 22 different reports, available in pdf form and ebook form. The combined report lists the major change from the 2018 threat landscape as the COVID-19-led transformation of the digital environment. During the pandemic, cyber criminals have been seen advancing their capabilities, adapting quickly and targeting relevant victim groups more effectively. EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar said: “Cyber threats are evolving and becoming increasingly complex. This is not new. The Agency has developed the latest ‘ENISA Threat Landscape’ into a more user-friendly format meeting the needs of its beneficiaries who can use it to advance their readiness and target the response better.” The ETL report warns that there is a long road ahead to reach a more secure digital environment. This is mainly due to the weakening of existing cybersecurity measures through changes in working and infrastructure patterns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This global phenomenon has led to a surge in cyber criminals’ personalised cyber attacks, using more advanced methods and techniques. Boasting a new visual and digital format, this year’s threat landscape contains seven strategic reports, along with 15 in-depth reports on the top cyber threats: The Year in Review report provides a general overview of the threat landscape, including the most important topics, and the top 15 threats, conclusions and recommendations. Cyber Threat Intelligence Overview summarises the most important topics relevant to the cyber threat intelligence (CTI) community. Sectoral and Thematic Threat Analysis reviews the threat landscape for specific sectors and technologies, including specifically the EU Agency for Cybersecurity’s work on 5G, the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cars. Main Incidents in the EU and Worldwide provides an overview of major cybersecurity incidents happening in the EU and worldwide, and highlights the lessons that can be learned. Research Topics report presents key aspects related to the research and innovation in cybersecurity surrounding the cyber threat intelligence domain. Emerging Trends focuses on the challenges and opportunities for the future in the cybersecurity domain. ENISA’s List of the Top 15 Threats. The top 15 cyber threat reports are of a technical nature, and include findings, major incidents, statistics and more. The threat reports are the following: Malware Web-based Attacks Phishing Web Application Attacks SPAM Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Identity Theft Data Breach Insider Threat Botnets Physical Manipulation, Damage, Theft and Loss Information Leakage Ransomware Cyber Espionage Cryptojacking The ETL report highlights important aspects and trends related to the threat landscape: There will be a new norm during and after the COVID-19 pandemic that is even more dependent on a secure and reliable cyberspace; The number of fake online shopping websites and fraudulent online merchants reportedly has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. From copycats of popular brands websites to fraudulent services that never deliver the merchandise, the coronavirus revealed weaknesses in the trust model used in online shopping; The number of cyberbullying and sextortion incidents also increased with the COVID-19 pandemic. The adoption of mobile technology and subscription to digital platforms makes younger generations more vulnerable to these types of threats; Malicious actors are using social media platforms to increase efficiency in targeted attacks; Financial reward is still the main motivation behind most cyber attacks; Finely targeted and persistent attacks on high-value data, such as intellectual property and state secrets, are being meticulously planned and executed often by state-sponsored actors; Massively distributed attacks with a short duration and wide impact are used with multiple aims such as credential theft; The number of phishing victims in the EU continues to grow with malicious actors using the COVID-19 theme to lure them in. COVID-19-themed attacks include messages carrying malicious file attachments and messages containing malicious links that redirect users to phishing sites or malware downloads; Business Email Compromise (BEC) and COVID-19-themed attacks are being used in cyber-scams resulting in the loss of millions of euros for EU citizens and corporations. European Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have also fallen victim of these threats in a time when many are going through severe financial difficulties due to the loss of revenue; Ransomware remains widespread with costly consequences to many EU organisations; Many cybersecurity incidents still go unnoticed or take a long time to be detected; The number of potential vulnerabilities in a virtual or physical environment continues to expand as a new phase of digital transformation arises (as technology will keep diversifying); With more security automation, organisations will invest more in preparedness using CTI as their main capability. Background The ETL report maps the cyber threat landscape in a means to help decision-makers, policy-makers and security specialists define strategies to defend citizens, organisations and cyberspace. This work is part of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity’s annual work programme to provide strategic intelligence to its stakeholders. The report’s content is gathered from open sources such as media articles, expert opinions, intelligence reports, incident analysis and security research reports; as well as through interviews with members of the ETL Stakeholders Group, who are part of the EU Cyber Threat Intelligence Community. From the information collected, the Agency produces its own analysis and views of the threat landscape that are meant to be industry and vendor agnostic. The analysis of each report is reviewed and validated by the CTI Stakeholders Group, whose members also vote on the annual list of the top 15 cyber threats.

ENISA_NEWS_0091	2020-10-19	NEWS	eHealth Security Conference on Covid-19 tracing mobile apps and key findings from session 1	 Together with the Danish Health Data Authority, the European Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) organises the eHealth Security Conference online Series on a monthly basis. The 1st edition focused on cybersecurity in healthcare during the COVID19 crisis. The event is available on the ENISA YouTube channel. The next live session will present views and cybersecurity concerns about Covid-19 tracing mobile Apps on 23rd October 14:00-16:00 CET.  Key findings of the conference: Cybersecurity in healthcare in times of a pandemic  Preparedness through cooperation and trust to be further improved; Extra efforts to raise awareness on cybersecurity issues among healthcare professionals to be made; Privacy aspects in relation to eHealth security to be addressed; Explore security options provided by other technologies (such as cloud solutions). Cybersecurity in eHealth: why does it matter? The cybersecurity required in hospitals is not different from the cybersecurity required in other sectors. However, the essential difference here lays on the impact it may have on patients’ safety. In addition to the needs highlighted by our participants, funding has been identified as a key element. It has become obvious that the cost of a cybersecurity incident may be significantly higher than the investment required to prepare against it. It was commonly agreed that hospitals will need extra national funding in order to reach the levels of cybersecurity required to operate securely. Working together towards secure eHealth: participants contributions Vibeke van der Sprong, Deputy Director General of the Danish Health Data Authority, introduced the measures applied in Denmark to enhance cooperation and support information sharing. Cyberattacks significantly increased over the last months. The necessity for employees to telework during the pandemic has been an aggravating factor. The authority worked closely with health professionals and launched a digital platform for information exchange. This platform was adjusted to meet the pandemic requirements, showing a flexible approach. An important point is to ensure how to best be prepared, through collaboration and trust, for the Danish healthcare system to quickly and adequately respond to the crisis. Albert Haro, member of the Agencia de Ciberseguretat de Catalunya commented that the crisis shed a light on essential points to consider, such as: Preparedness to reduce the impact of incidents; Ensure flexibility by using cloud solutions; Consider the privacy aspects in the complex cybersecurity eHealth landscape; Promote awareness to healthcare professionals. According to Sabina Magalini, from the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli, the healthcare sector will never be the same after this crisis. Hospitals have avoided reporting cybersecurity incidents in fear of heavy sanctions. With the new era of remote working and life conditions, hospitals will be facing the development of teleworking and the increased need to resort to smart devices to operate. To support the cybersecurity challenges of these developments, the EU issues regulations specifically tailored to the health sector. Martin Konir, from the Bulovka Hospital, reported that hospitals in the Czech Republic were the targets of heavy attacks during the first wave of the pandemic. However, thanks to the support of the National Authority, these attacks were neutralised. As a consequence of the media coverage of such events, the population is now aware of the issues and can understand the risks better. The situation has therefore created traction to implement stronger cybersecurity measures. Join the 2nd online session of the eHealth Security Conference Series The next live session will focus on cybersecurity for the Covid-19 tracing mobile applications and will introduce the EC toolbox. The session will take place on 23rd October 14:00-16:00 CET. The keynote speaker will be Christian D'Cunha from the European Commission, together with the designated panellists: Birgitte Drewes,  from the Danish Patient Safety Authority; Dr. Dina C. Truxius, from the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI); Ieva Ilves, digital policy and cybersecurity Advisor to the President of Latvia; Dirk Willem van Gulik, assisting the Dutch MoH with the “CoronaMelder”.

ENISA_NEWS_0092	2020-10-14	NEWS	Measuring ‘Security and Trust’ at the Annual Trust Services Forum 	 On September 22, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), in collaboration with the European Commission, delivered the 6th annual Trust Services Forum, which attracted more than 500 participants and brought together trust service providers, conformity assessment bodies, supervisory bodies and experts to discuss the practical and emerging issues under the eIDAS Regulation across Europe. This conference took place on the eve of the 12th annual CA-Day, organised by D-TRUST, in cooperation with TÜViT and ESMT. Both conferences were held in a hybrid format, with physical presence for the panellists at ESMT, in Berlin and virtual presence for the participants. In the past three years, the Trust Services Forum and CA-Day have taken place back-to-back to offer participants a two-day deep dive into the policy and technical aspects of the implementation of the eIDAS Regulation, which provides the regulatory framework in the European Union for electronic identification and Trust Services for cross-border electronic transactions. This year’s programme was held during the first review of the application of the eIDAS Regulation (eIDAS). The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar said: “The EU Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is moving fast to cover the ground of electronic identity and complement its ongoing support to the European Commission and the Member States in Trust Services. The work of ENISA on e-identity can complement the Commission’s efforts to increase EU citizens’ control over how their data is used, and contribute to a more cyber secure and trusted digital market across Europe.” With eIDAS, the EU has laid the foundation and legal framework for citizens, businesses and public administrations to safely access services, and carry out transactions online and across borders. eIDAS solutions can create savings for companies and roll out the means for any cross-border activity that requires a secure and trusted environment. However, the COVID-19 pandemic across the EU has highlighted the security concerns of remote identification and authentication processes. Panellists elaborated on the upcoming revisions of the eIDAS that will aim to improve its effectiveness, extend its application to the private sector and promote trusted digital identities for all EU citizens Background The Trust Services Forum acts as a platform for participants to share their good practices on the implementation of trust services; review the standards, implementing acts and technical guidelines within the eIDAS; and discuss strategies to promote the adoption of qualified trust services. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity supports the Commission on the implementation of the eIDAS by providing security recommendations for the implementation of trust services, mapping technical and regulatory requirements, promoting the deployment of qualified trust services in Europe and raising awareness among users on securing their e-transactions. Under the EU Cybersecurity Act of 2019, the Agency gained an extended mandate to explore the area of electronic identification (eIDs) included in the regulation.

The purpose of the framework is to help Member States perform a self-assessment of their level of maturity. By assessing their National Cybersecurity Strategy objectives both at strategic and at operational level, Member States will be able to possibly enhance existing and build new cybersecurity capabilities. Other benefits include: Identification of elements missing within the strategy; Establish a history of lessons learned; Referencing best practices; Generate credibility and showing transparency for the public, National and international stakeholders and partners. Sixty participants coming from academia, EU institutions, National Authorities, Ministries, and CSIRTs attended the online workshop. They were all actively engaged in the assessment and validation of the proposed report, which will be published late this year or early next year. Members of the Hellenic Ministry of Digital Governance and of the Ministry of Justice and Security in the Netherlands also intervened. Each of them gave a short presentation on the recent NCSS efforts conducted in Greece and in the Netherlands respectively. They also shared the main challenges they face as well as good practices and lessons learned. The representatives identified the following challenges and lessons learned: Most resources tend to be dedicated to the planning and implementation phase. While obviously important, this may lead to a lack of coordination and organisation in the monitoring and evaluation phase of the strategy. The strategy should provide explicit ownership and accountability for the measures identified to reach the objectives. This is not currently the case. Clarifying relations between objectives, measures, resources and expected outputs of the next national strategy will be essential in order to re-structure the policy theory. Cybersecurity is a domain where information is highly confidential and not easily distributed. This is why it is crucial for EU Member States to have common tools and processes based on the shared experience. Background on National Cybersecurity Strategies In line with its strategic objectives, the European Agency for Cybersecurity, (ENISA) supports the efforts of Member States in the area of NCSS by: Supporting cybersecurity as an integral part of national policies through the development of guidelines on the NCSS lifecycle and through analysis of existing strategies to outline good practices. The Good Practice Guide on NCSS published in 2016 is one of them. Supports cutting-edge competencies and capabilities through performing deep dives on specific national strategic objectives, such as the publication on the Good practices in Innovation. This can also be done by developing online tools to support the uptake of lessons learned and good practices. Examples of such tools are the NCSS evaluation tool and the NCSS Interactive Map. Empowering and engaging Member States through community building by maintaining an experts group on NCSS and by fostering cooperation and exchange of good practices between MS. Publications on effective collaborative models for PPPs and ISACs are good examples of such effort. All Member States have developed a National Cybersecurity Strategy since 2017. Most MS have implemented their strategy while some have already published a 2nd or 3rd version.

ENISA_PR_0095	2020-10-06	PR	IoT Cybersecurity: Webinar Series to Tackle Security Challenges of IoT	" Tomorrow, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), Europol’s Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions, Bodies and Agencies (CERT-EU) will launch the 4thannual IoT Security Conference series to raise awareness on the security challenges facing the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem across the European Union. The series will span three weeks, with each week exploring a different cybersecurity topic: Operational IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Supply Chain for IoT, respectively. The series will be held in a virtual webinar format, open to public Q&A EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar said: “Fostering trust and security of our connected digital devices, the Internet of Things, is a priority. When discussing IoT security across Europe, we need a common approach to all aspects of cybersecurity that also considers the context in which IoT products and services operate. For example, a smart medical device such as a connected insulin pump undoubtedly carries higher risk than that of a household smart light bulb. This IoT security webinar series will discuss these issues in order to provide input to policy makers, especially on critical infrastructure sectors employing emerging technologies, such as IoT and AI, and possible cybersecurity certification schemes that could support this effort."" Head of Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) Edvardas Šileris said: “You can secure only what you can understand. The challenge of the Internet-of-Things is understanding what is happening.  Through this conference, we want to contribute to this understanding from our law enforcement perspective, identifying how criminals can and will abuse the potential of IoT.  The complexity of IoT and its resulting cybersecurity challenges call for a smart and multi-stakeholder approach. I invite everyone from law enforcement, industry, government and academia with an interest in cyber security to join us online to reflect on how to increase the cyber resilience of the IoT ecosystem.” Head of CERT-EU Saâd Kadhi said: “CERT-EU and CSIRTs from all over the world have been working very hard to keep threats at bay. As teleworking became the norm in the aftermath of COVID-19, the surface we need to protect grew exponentially. The Internet of Things will contribute, more and more, to this growth as many IoT devices are not designed with security in mind. And now that they are gaining a foothold in critical infrastructure and establishing bridges between the digital and physical worlds, it is vital that security become a requirement and not an option. Otherwise, I’m afraid the challenges ahead of us will be overwhelming.” As vehicles, medical devices, factories and energy plants rely more on the emerging technologies driving forward this increasingly interconnected world, they also become exposed to new threats. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity, Europol and CERT-EU underline the importance of understanding these threats and attacks, and the need to use effective mechanisms to enhance the security of IoT devices. The IoT Security Conference will open discussions into the trustworthiness of IoT with topics about supply chain integrity, AI deployments and regulations surrounding IoT. The webinars will be opened by Mr. Kadhi, Mr. Šileris and Mr. Lepassaar, respectively, and will include high-level speakers such as Mr. Andreas Könen, Director General of Cyber and Information Security at the German Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community, representing the Presidency of the Council of the EU. The series, moderated by Europol EC3’s Head of Strategy and Development Team Dr. Nicole van der Meulen, is a three-part interactive series featuring discussions by cybersecurity professionals, experts from cybercrime units, computer security incident response teams, international organisations, private industry, regulatory agencies and academia who will share their views on how to overcome current challenges and how to make cyberspace safer for EU citizens. Event Schedule Operational IoT – 7 October 2020 at 15:00 to 16:30 CET Session 2: Artificial Intelligence – 14 October at 15:00 to 16:30 CET Supply Chain for IoT – 21 October at 15:00 to 16:30 CET Register here Trailer Video   Background The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, Europol and CERT-EU have been working intensely on tackling the security challenges of IoT for Europe’s infrastructure, businesses, governments and citizens by identifying good practices and measures to allow IoT to function in a more secure and privacy-respecting manner. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity is dedicated to promoting a culture of security that will improve the ability of EU Member States to respond to cyber-attacks. The Agency has been raising awareness on IoT security through events and summer school courses, and through the publication of in-depth studies, reports and position papers on current cybersecurity matters. Key publications include the Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT and the Good Practices for Security of IoT in the context of Smart Manufacturing. Most recently, the Agency has aggregated these publications and activities on good practices for IoT and smart infrastructure in an online tool to serve as a reference point for IoT security. Europol has been researching the many advantages of the IoT for law enforcement as a tool to fight crime, and is also doing the same in the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Data from connected devices at a crime scene can provide crucial evidence to an investigation, but such data require the same safeguards and security standards to ensure the privacy and safety of citizens. At the same time, Europol is researching how AI can also be (part of) the answer to challenges faced by law enforcement in the execution of criminal investigations, namely information processing and other parts of policing. From a threat perspective, Europol, in close cooperation with industry and academia, is looking into the potential use of AI by criminals with a view to better anticipating possible malicious and criminal activities facilitated by AI, as well as to prevent, respond to, or mitigate the effects of such attacks in a pro-active manner. CERT-EU, with many experiences on IoT evolution, has witnessed how the technology has become a major issue in terms of cybersecurity, being the “forgotten” part of the security ecosystem – both by manufacturers and users. It supports operations that allow cybersecurity professionals to respond to daily technical challenges.

ENISA_PR_0096	2020-10-01	PR	Artificial Intelligence: Cybersecurity Essential for Security & Trust	" On 30 September, Member of European Parliament Eva Kaili and the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) co-hosted the Cybersecurity for Artificial Intelligence (C4AI) virtual workshop to explore the security challenges related to Artificial Intelligence (AI). Speakers and panellists discussed the current risks and offered ways forward to establishing a secure ecosystem for AI across the Union. AI continues to gain strength and broaden its scope.  It is influencing people’s everyday lives and playing a key role in digital transformation through its automated decision-making capabilities. The benefits of this emerging technology are significant , but so are the concerns. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity warns that AI may open new avenues in manipulation and attack methods, as well as new privacy challenges. Take, for example, AI-guided autonomous vehicles. The implementation of measures to protect users from malfunctions or data manipulation in smart cars is ongoing. The C4AI event highlighted the role of cybersecurity in establishing the reliable and trustworthy deployment of AI – a principle area of work by the EU Agency for Cybersecurity. The Agency is actively mapping the AI cybersecurity ecosystem, and is set to publish its Threat Landscape for AI Cybersecurity Report, with the support of the Ad-Hoc Working Group on Artificial Intelligence Cybersecurity, later this year. MEP and Chair of the Future of Science and Technology Panel in the European Parliament Eva Kaili said: “Trust is one of the most important factors for the adoption of new technologies. Recent cases of deepfakes or manipulation of citizens' data and cyber threats faced by businesses, foster distrust in technology; Europe must lead in a safe digital era without compromising privacy, especially in relation to AI, a technology that has exponential transformative powers. We must take advantage of the opportunities that AI brings for the European society and economy in a safe and secure way with respect for digital rights and quality standards for all. Cybersecurity is therefore key in inspiring trust in AI and we as regulators have to ensure that an all-encompassing cybersecurity strategy in Europe complements our ambitions towards developing our European AI capabilities."" Despina Spanou, Head of Cabinet for European Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas, said: “There cannot be AI without cybersecurity if the technology is to expand and be beneficial for our society and the economy."" EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar said: “Cybersecurity is the foundation of trustworthy Artificial Intelligence solutions. It will serve as a springboard for the widespread secure deployment of AI across the EU.” The workshop opened yesterday with keynote speeches by MEP Kaili, Ms. Spanou and Mr. Lepassaar. Moderated by EU Agency for Cybersecurity Head of Secure Infrastructure and Services, Evangelos Ouzounis, panellists shared their views on the role of cybersecurity for the adoption of AI. They discussed ways of fostering a secure ecosystem for AI, including exploring a roadmap for its trustworthy deployment. Discussions also touched on the main regulatory issues of AI facing the EU, as well as the technical, data protection and R&D risks of AI to end users.   Background The European Commission has highlighted the importance of AI in society and the economy in its White Paper on Artificial Intelligence, which is the frontrunner to upcoming policy initiatives on the technology. The Commission has also recognised the strategic importance of AI in its “Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence”, which aims to harmonise and coordinate AI initiatives across the Union, including addressing its security-related aspects. Additionally, this July, it its Security Union Strategy the Commission underlined the significance of AI, noting that it will bring both new benefits and new risks.

ENISA_PR_0098	2020-09-29	PR	Blue OLEx 2020: the European Union Member States launch the Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe)	 In 2019, high level executives of national cybersecurity authorities, the European Commission and ENISA, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity participated in the table-top Blueprint Operational Level Exercise (Blue OLEx) 2019, which underlined the need to implement an intermediate level between the technical and the political ones in the EU cyber crisis management framework. Thierry Breton, Commissioner for the Internal Market, said: “The new Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network indicates once again an excellent cooperation between the Member States and the EU in ensuring that our networks and critical systems are cyber secure. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility and we should work collectively in preparing and implementing rapid emergency response plans, for example in case of a large-scale cyber incident or crisis.” EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar said: “Cyber crises have no borders. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity is committed to support the Union in its response to cyber incidents. It is important that the national cybersecurity agencies come together to coordinate decision-making at all levels. The CyCLONe group address this missing link.” Blue OLEx 2020: tabletop exerciseand strategic policy discussion The second edition of the table-top exercise, which this year takes place online, Blue OLEx 2020, is organised by the Netherlands with the support of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA on 29 September 2020. The aim of the exercise is to build a stronger relationship among the cybersecurity community participating in the exercise, increase the situational awareness, share best practices. Finally it sets the scene for a high-level political discussion, on strategic cyber policy issues, in particular, shaping a coherent framework for crisis management at EU level. It gathers high level executives of the 27 Members States’ competent authorities in charge of cyber crisis management and/or cyber policy, the European Commission and the EU Agency for Cybersecurity in charge of cybersecurity and is the opportunity for them to officially launch the Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe) and explore the interaction between the new network and the political level. The CyCLONe: a new cooperation network for Member States The CyCLONe’s aim is to contribute to the implementation of the European Commission's Blueprint for rapid emergency response in case of a large-scale cross-border cyber incident or crisis and complements the existing cybersecurity structures at EU level by linking the cooperation at technical (e.g. Computer Security Incident Response Team - CSIRTs) and political levels (e.g. Integrated Political Crisis Response - IPCR). By doing so, the CyCLONe will fulfill two fundamental objectives: enabling consultations on national response strategies and coordinated impact assessment on the anticipated or observed impacts of a crisis, to the benefit of policy decision-makers, both at national and EU level. The CyCLONe – which is the result of the work carried out by a work-stream of the NIS Cooperation Group led by France and Italy –   will operate based on agreed operating procedures, relying on appropriate ICT tools for communication and information sharing provided by the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, which serves as the CyCLONe Secretariat. With the support of the European Commission, the network has already established a clear roadmap for the year to come with three key moments contributing to enhance the preparedness of the network: the after action report of Blue OLEx 2020, Cyber Europe 2021 and Blue OLEx 2021. The lessons learned during Blue OLEx 2020 will feed into supplementing the standard operating procedures of the CyCLONe and shape future exercises.  ABOUT Blue OLEx Blue OLEx is a high-level event organised each year by one member state and supported by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, in collaboration with the European Commission. It aims to test the EU preparedness in the event of a cyber-related crisis affecting the EU Member States and to strengthen the cooperation between the national cybersecurity authorities, the European Commission and ENISA.  Press Contact For questions related to the press and interviews, please contact press (at) enisa.europa.eu.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0100	2020-09-22	NEWS	Ninth ENISA-EC3 Workshop on CSIRTs-LE Cooperation: standing shoulder-to-shoulder to counter cybercrime	 The CSIRTs and LE communities from the EU and EFTA countries, together with representatives from the EU Institutions and Bodies and the Council of Europe, met to discuss ways to effectively cooperate for the purpose of countering cybercrime. The favourable conditions for cybercrime caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have only rendered this meeting even more important. Keeping all stakeholders involved, as stressed by ENISA, has been overwhelmingly accepted in this year’s event, organised by invitation only. As a result of the COVID-19 situation, the CSIRT and LE communities had to coordinate their reactions and respond to the attacks targeting, for instance, the health sector already facing a critical situation because of the pandemic. During the workshop the participants had also the opportunity to share success stories and bring forward national examples of cooperation and crisis management, as well as initiatives from EU Institutions and bodies. Experts discussed relevant EU policy developments, cooperation frameworks and response mechanisms against cyber threats. Key Takeaways Key takeaways of the workshop were that trust is the cornerstone of the CSIRTs and LE cooperation and that the judiciary needs to be involved at an early stage of a response to an attack. The event also highlighted that it is essential to have the legal and policy framework and the necessary tools and procedures in place. Finally, crises offer a unique opportunity to test CSIRTs and LE cooperation and identify gaps. The 2020 ENISA report on CSIRTs and LE cooperation, expected to be finalised by end of 2020, will be published in the publication section of the ENISA website.

Cybersecurity Is A Shared Responsibility Each year, ECSM organisers bring together people from across Europe to join forces under the slogan ‘Cybersecurity is a Shared Responsibility’ to unite against cyber threats. The ECSM campaign is coordinated by the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) and the European Commission, and supported by the EU Member States and more than 300 partners (governments, universities, think tanks, NGOs, professional associations, private sector businesses) from Europe, and beyond. EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director Juhan Lepassaar said: “European Cybersecurity Month is one of the EU’s most important campaigns that engages people across our region, and beyond, to better understand cybersecurity and adopt good cyber practices. Boosting knowledge about cybersecurity is not only key to building trust among EU citizens, but it is our shared responsibility.” ECSM 2020 The outbreak of COVID-19 has brought an immediate change in the way people conduct their daily lives. People have become more reliant on the Internet for communication, education, purchases, business and more. This digitalisation of everyday life brings with it a rise in cyber crime. In this increasingly connected world, there is a need for people to be aware of security risks and have the up-to-date tools to mitigate them. This year’s ECSM campaign has been designed to address these issues.   Under the motto, ‘Think Before U Click’, ECSM 2020’s programme includes two themes to help people identify and be prepared for cyber threats. The first theme,  ‘Cyber Scams’, will provide participants with insights into current and potential cyber threats such as phishing, business email compromise and online shopping fraud. The second theme, ‘Digital Skills’, will provide participants with information on e-privacy matters such as personal data protection, cyber bullying and cyber stalking. Background The European Cybersecurity Month first launched in 2012. The campaign is now part of the actions designed to implement the provisions of the EU Cybersecurity Act on awareness raising and education. The Act mandates the EU Agency for Cybersecurity to organise regular outreach campaigns in cooperation with Member States, and EU Institutions, bodies, offices and other agencies. The ECSM is one of the areas in which the Agency assists Member States in their efforts to raise cybersecurity awareness and promote cybersecurity education across the Union.

ENISA_NEWS_0104	2020-07-24	NEWS	Report on the EU 5G Toolbox Implementation by Member States Published	" Today, EU Member States, with the support of the European Commission and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, published a report on the progress made in implementing the joint EU toolbox of mitigating measures for identified 5G risks, which was agreed by the Member States and endorsed by a Commission Communication in January 2020. The toolbox sets out a joint approach based on an objective assessment of identified risks and proportionate mitigating measures to address security risks related to the rollout of 5G, the fifth-generation of mobile networks. The Agency has actively supported the Commission and the Member States in preparation of this implementation report and is working on various supporting actions defined in the toolbox that will enable and assist implementation of relevant strategic and technical measures. Juhan Lepassaar, Executive Director of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, said: ""The toolbox sets the foundation for a coordinated EU approach towards 5G security based on a risk management approach. All Member States have made progress in implementing the necessary measures. Also, it is acknowledged by all that the job is not finished and we are reinforcing the measures as we go along. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity is committed to assist in this. We also update the 5G threat landscape and stand ready to develop an EU 5G cybersecurity certification scheme should it be requested.'' While work is still ongoing in many Member States, the report notes that all Member States have launched a process to review and strengthen security measures applicable to 5G networks, demonstrating their commitment to the coordinated approach defined at the EU level. For each of the toolbox measures, the report reviews progress made since the toolbox adoption, showing what has already been done and identifying areas where measures have not been implemented so far. Ensuring resilience of 5G networks is essential to our society, since this technology is expected not only to have an impact on digital communications, but also on critical sectors such as energy, transport, banking and health, as well as on industrial control systems. 5G networks will be carrying sensitive information and will be supporting safety systems that will come to rely on them. Market players are largely responsible for the secure rollout of 5G, and Member States are responsible for national security – yet, collective work and coordinated implementation of appropriate measures is fundamental to ensure EU businesses and citizens can make full use of all the benefits of the new technology in a secure way. The toolbox implementation is the result of collective work and of the strong determination by all Member States, together with the Commission and the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, to cooperate and respond to the security challenges of 5G networks and to assure the continued openness of the digital single market. In the toolbox, Member States agreed to strengthen security requirements through a possible set of recommended measures, in particular to assess the risk profiles of suppliers, to apply relevant restrictions for suppliers considered to be high risk (including necessary exclusions for key assets considered as critical and sensitive, such as the core network functions), and to have strategies in place to ensure the diversification of vendors. Main insights of the report on the EU 5G toolbox Today’s report analyses the progress made in implementing the toolbox measures at the national level, coming to a set of conclusions. Good progress has already been made for some of the toolbox measures, namely in the following areas: The powers of national regulatory authorities to regulate 5G security, have been or are in the process of being reinforced in a large majority of Member States, including powers to regulate the procurement of network equipment and services by operators. Measures aimed at restricting the involvement of suppliers based on their risk profile are already in place in a few Member States and at an advanced stage of preparation in many others. The report calls on other Member States to further advance and complete this process in the coming months. With regards to the precise scope of these restrictions, the report highlights the importance to look at the network as a whole and address core network elements as well as other critical and highly sensitive elements, including management functions and the radio access network, and of imposing restrictions also on other key assets, such as defined geographical areas, government or other critical entities. For those operators having already contracted with high risk vendors, transition periods should be put in place.  Network security and resilience requirements for mobile operators are being reviewed in a majority of Member States. This report underlines the importance to ensure that these requirements are strengthened, that they follow the latest state-of-the-art practices and that their implementation by operators is effectively audited and enforced. Furthermore, some measures are at a less advanced stage of implementation. In particular, the report calls for: Progress is urgently needed to mitigate the risk of dependency on high-risk suppliers, also with a view to reducing dependencies at the Union level. This should be based on a thorough inventory of the networks’ supply chains and implies monitoring the evolution of the situation. Challenges have been identified in designing and imposing appropriate multi-vendor strategies for individual mobile network operators (MNOs) or at the national level due to technical or operational difficulties (e.g. lack of interoperability, size of the country). Steps to be taken in the context of screening of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI), to introduce national FDI screening mechanism without delay in 13 Member States where it is not yet in place, including in view of the approaching application of the EU investment screening framework as of October 2020. These screening mechanisms should be applied to investment developments potentially affecting the 5G value chain, taking into account the objectives of the toolbox. Going forward the report also recommends that Member State authorities: Exchange more information about the challenges, best practices and solutions for implementing the toolbox measures; continue monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the toolbox; and, continue working with the Commission to implement EU-level actions listed in the toolbox, including in the area of standardisation and certification, trade defence instruments and competition rules to avoid distortions in the 5G supply market. Also, investing in EU capacities in 5G and post-5G technologies, and ensuring 5G projects supported with public funding take into account cybersecurity risks. Next Steps The Commission will continue to work with Member States and the EU Agency for Cybersecurity within the framework of the NIS Cooperation Group, to monitor the implementation of the toolbox and to ensure its effective and consistent application. The Group will also promote the alignment of national approaches through further exchanges of experiences and by working with the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC). As part of the implementation of the Commission Recommendation adopted last year, by 1 October 2020, Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, should assess the effects of the Recommendation and determine whether there is a need for further action. This assessment should take into account the outcome of the EU coordinated risk assessment that was published in October 2019, as well as of the effectiveness of the toolbox measures. Background In March 2019, following a call by the European Council for a concerted approach to the security of 5G, the Commission adopted a Recommendation on Cybersecurity of 5G networks. It called on Member States to complete national risk assessments, to review national measures and to work together at the EU level on a coordinated risk assessment and a common toolbox of mitigating measures. Based on the Member States’ national risk assessment, the Report on the EU coordinated risk assessment of the cybersecurity of 5G networks, presented in October 2019, identified the main threats and threats actors, the most sensitive assets, the main vulnerabilities and a number of strategic risks. To complement this report and as a further input for the toolbox, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity carried out a dedicated threat landscape mapping, consisting of a detailed analysis of certain technical aspects, in particular the identification of network assets and of threats affecting these. In January 2020, the Member States, acting through the NIS Cooperation Group, adopted the EU Toolbox of risk mitigating measures. The Commission adopted a Communication, on that same day, in which it endorsed the toolbox underlining the importance of its effective and quick implementation, and called on Member States to prepare a report on its implementation by 30 June 2020, which was therefore published today.   Further Information Progress report on the implementation of the joint EU toolbox Commission Communication on Secure 5G Deployment in the EU EU Toolbox on 5G Cybersecurity Questions and Answers on the EU toolbox NIS Cooperation Group website Press Contact For questions related to the press and interviews, please contact press (at) enisa.europa.eu.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0105	2020-07-23	PR	A billion user hours lost in EU telecoms due to security incidents in 2019	" The report published today provides an analysis of root causes and impact of major incidents that happened in the course of 2019 and multiannual trends. The national telecom security authorities in Europe reported a total of 153 major telecom security incidents in 2019. These incident reports were submitted to the EU Agency for Cybersecurity as part of the annual summary reporting on major telecom security incidents in the EU. The reported incidents had a total impact of almost 1 Billion user hours lost. Juhan Lepassaar, the Executive Director of ENISA, said: ""Incident reporting is essential to understand different factors that play a role in cybersecurity incidents, as well as relevant issues. It helps us to see the trends and allows us to assess if the related legislation is working. This will help us to develop the right security measures, if further adjustments or clarifications are needed in the form of implementing acts, and thus improve the overall level of cybersecurity. National authorities use the reporting as a basis for targeted policy initiatives. Our role at ENISA is to make sure that the process is working and to allow the stakeholders, the Member States and the Commission to get the most out of it. We work to harmonise the security incident reporting processes across the Union, to reduce security risks and barriers to the internal market."" Jakub Boratyński, Acting Director of Directorate H in DG CONNECT commented: “Security incident reporting is important in order to get hard numbers about incidents, to analyse root causes and impact, which helps prevent future incidents. It is essential to collect this data not only at EU-level, but also at national level. The COVID-19 outbreak shows more clearly than ever the importance of securing telecom networks.” Number of incidents and million user hours lost per year The report published today presents an analysis of root causes, impact, and trends of major incidents. It is the 9th annual report on telecom security incidents. Key takeaways from the 2019 incidents System failures dominate in terms of impact: this category makes up almost half (48%) of the total user hours lost. It is also the most frequent root cause of incidents. Both the frequency and overall impact of system failures have been trending down significantly over the past 4 years; More than a quarter (26%) of total incidents have human errors as the root cause. Human errors increased by 50% compared to the previous year; Almost a third (32%) of the incidents were also flagged as a third-party failure. This means that these incidents originate at third parties, typically utility companies, contractors, suppliers, etc. This number tripled compared to 2018 when it was 9% then; Looking inside the category of system failures, hardware failures are a major factor: almost a quarter of incidents (23%) were caused by hardware failures and they heavily impacted user hours amounting to 38%; Power cuts continue to be an important factor: being either the primary or the secondary cause in over a fifth of the major incidents. To access the report, please visit: ENISA - Telecom Services Security Incidents 2019 Annual Analysis Report ENISA provides also an online visual tool - CIRAS - giving public access to the full repository of telecom security. This tool gives statistics and anonymized information about the 1200 major incidents reported over the past 9 years.   EECC broadening the scope of the telecom security incident reporting The New EU telecom legislation, known as the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC), has to be transposed into national law by 21 December 2020. These new rules are broader in scope, adapting to the changes in the EU’s electronic communications landscape. The new legislation will also cover so-called number-independent interpersonal communications services, such as Whatsapp and Skype. The reporting obligations will cover a broader range of telecom security incidents, including incidents having an impact on confidentiality, availability, integrity or authenticity of the communication networks and the data transmitted via those networks or services. ENISA is working with the EU Member States to implement these changes. The annual reporting guideline is currently being updated to include new thresholds for the annual summary reporting. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity is also updating the guidelines on security measures. General observations National telecom authorities use incident reports for targeted policy initiatives and guidelines: the mandatory reporting helps to identify common root causes. This is how we start finding solutions to mitigate the impact of some of the biggest incidents. Every year the annual summary reporting at EU level highlights important issues and trends: the national authorities then follow up these issues and trends in more details. Reporting about threats: under the new provisions of the EECC, important threats will also have to be reported along with incidents. This means there is a clear need for national authorities to exchange information about ongoing attacks and important vulnerabilities, in addition to actual incidents with impact on telecom services. The current incident reporting does not show the complete telecom security threat landscape: security incidents not causing large network disruptions currently remain out of the reporting obligations. Background information Electronic communication providers in the EU have to notify telecom security incidents having a significant impact to the national authorities for telecom security in their country. At the beginning of every calendar year, the authorities send summary reports about these incidents to the EU Agency for Cybersecurity. Security incident reporting has been part of the telecom regulatory framework of the European Union (EU) since the 2009 reform of the telecom package: Article 13a of the Framework directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011. The breach reporting in Article 13a focuses on security incidents with significant impact on the operation of services, such as outages of the electronic communication networks and/or services. Article 40 of the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) will replace Article 13a by the end of 2020. The Article 13a Expert Group was founded by ENISA back in 2010, under the auspices of the European Commission. Its purpose is to bring together experts from national telecom security authorities from across the EU to agree on a practical and harmonised approach to the security supervision requirements in Article 13a and to agree on an efficient and effective incident reporting process. Warna Munzebrock, a representative of Agentschap Telecom, the Dutch Radiocommunications agency, now chairs the group. The Article 13 expert group meets 3 times per year and its work and deliverables can be found in the Article 13a Expert Group portal hosted by ENISA.

ENISA_NEWS_0110	2020-07-10	NEWS	Annual Report on Trust Services Security Incidents in 2019	 For the year 2019, 27 EU countries and 2 EFTA countries reported 32 security incidents that had a significant impact on trust services in the EU. The 2019 Annual Report published today gives an aggregated overview of these security breaches showing root causes, statistics and trends. This report marks the fourth round of security incident reporting for the EU’s trust services sector. According to the EU regulation on Electronic Identification and Trust Services (eIDAS), trust service providers must notify security breaches to their national supervisory body. The national supervisory bodies send annual summary reports about these breaches to ENISA and to the European Commission. ENISA aggregates this information in its Annual Reports. Key takeways from the 2019 incident report: A significant increase in notified incidents: with an increase of nearly 80% in terms of reported incidents compared to the previous year. System failures as the dominant root cause: they account for more than 60% of the incidents and remain the dominant root cause over the past four years of incident reporting. Most reported incidents concerned qualified trust services: more than three quarters of total incidents (78 %) had an impact on qualified trust services. Most of the incidents were minor: most incidents were minor, but a third of the incidents (31%) were rated as having a large impact. Unlike the previous two years, in 2019 there were no reports about incidents with impact rated as disastrous. Root cause categories Trust services incidents in the EU General observations: Supervision of, and incident reporting by, non-qualified services: statistics of the reported incidents suggest there is under-reporting of security breaches with non-qualified trust services. Reporting about vulnerabilities and attacks-in-the-wild: there is a clear need to exchange information not only about actual incidents with impact at a TSP’s trust service, but also about attacks and vulnerabilities. To access the report, please visit: Trust Services Security Incidents 2019 Annual Analysis Report ENISA and the eIDAS regulation The Agency will continue to support the national supervisory bodies to implement the breach reporting under the Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation, and will work towards making this process efficient, effective and yielding statistics. Such data are useful for the supervising bodies, for the authorities of other sectors, as well as for the trust service providers and the organisations relying on these trust services.  In this direction, ENISA has recently released a new Visual Tool - CIRAS designed to increase transparency about cybersecurity incidents. The online visual tool, accessible to the public, gives now access to 4 years of trust services incident reports and to 8 years of telecom security incidents, aggregating as many as 1100 cybersecurity incidents. The new visual tool also allows for analysis of multiannual trends.  Background information Electronic trust services include a range of electronic services around digital signatures, digital certificates, electronic seals, timestamps, etc. used to secure electronic, online, transactions. The eIDAS regulation is the EU wide legal framework meant to ensure the interoperability and security of the electronic trust services across the EU. One of the goals of the eIDAS is to ensure electronic transactions can have the same legal validity as traditional paper - based transactions, to create a framework in which a digital signature has the same value has a hand-written signature. This regulation is important for the European digital market because it allows businesses and citizens to work and use digital services across the EU. Adopted in July 2014, the eIDAS regulation came into force in 2016. Security is an important pillar of the overall framework. Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation requires trust service providers in the EU to assess risks, take appropriate security measures, mitigate security breaches. They notify breaches to the national supervisory bodies who, in turn send annual summary reports about the notified breaches to ENISA and the Commission. ENISA publishes aggregated data on a yearly basis. Security and trust are crucial factors in making eIDAS a success. ENISA supports the European Commission and the EU Member States with implementing the security requirements of the eIDAS regulation and supports collaboration and exchange of information between national supervisory bodies in Europe about the security of trust services.

ENISA_NEWS_0113	2020-07-02	NEWS	ENISA Launches Public Consultation for First Candidate Cybersecurity Certification Scheme	 Today, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is launching a month-long public consultation for the first candidate cybersecurity certification scheme, the Common Criteria based European cybersecurity certification scheme (EUCC). The scheme aims to replace the existing schemes operating under the SOG-IS MRA for ICT products, to add new elements and to extend the scope to cover all EU Member States. The public consultation allows interested parties to provide feedback on the draft of the EUCC candidate scheme and the outcome will be processed and shared. The consultation will remain open for contributions until July 31st, 12:00 CET.  To participate in the Public Consultation, please go to:  EUCC Consultation Survey Over the past two decades, the Common Criteria have proven efficient for the certification of chips and smartcards across Europe, and have enhanced the level of security of electronic signature devices, for means of identification such as passports, banking cards and tachographs for lorries. More recently, the criteria have been used intensively to certify the cybersecurity of ICT software products. This new candidate scheme aims to further improve the Union’s internal market conditions for ICT products, and positively affects the ICT services and ICT processes relying on such products. About the EUCC candidate scheme: Built on the current SOG-IS MRA and Common Criteria with rules included for transition; Applicable to ICT products; Covers assurance levels ‘Substantial’ and ‘High’; Certificate validity for five years, can be renewed; Allows for composite certification; Recognition in all EU Member States; Voluntary scheme; Harmonised conditions for vulnerability handling and disclosure;  Clearly defined rules on monitoring and handling non-compliance and non-conformity; Introduces a new patch management mechanism to support vulnerability handling; Use of a framework-based label and a QR code to ensure easy access to accurate certification information. The EU Cybersecurity Act of 2019 (CSA) lays down an EU cybersecurity certification framework for the purpose of ensuring an adequate level of cybersecurity for ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes in the Union, as well as of avoiding fragmentation of the internal market. ENISA’s task under the CSA is to prepare and develop candidate cybersecurity certification schemes with the involvement and support of stakeholders and a working group. The first ad hoc working group for this scheme, the EUCC AHWG, was set up late last year by ENISA, and is chaired by the Agency. The group is composed of 20 appointed members representing industry (developers, evaluators), and 12 participants from Member States and accreditation bodies. The EUCC AHWG has been working in close collaboration with the Commission and with the European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG). The EUCC is the first candidate scheme in the framework. A second candidate scheme is currently in preparation and relates to the certification of cloud services.

ENISA_NEWS_0116	2020-06-26	NEWS	The EU Cybersecurity Act’s first anniversary: one step closer to a cyber secure Europe	 On 27 June 2020, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) celebrates the first anniversary of the EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA) and its strengthened role towards securing Europe’s information society. The CSA gave the Agency a permanent mandate, a new list of tasks and increased resources, and also established the EU cybersecurity certification framework.  The Agency now plays a key role in setting up the framework and builds on its past work towards achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across the European Union by actively supporting Member States, EU institutions, industry, academia and citizens. Regarding the framework, the Agency is close to completing the first cybersecurity certification scheme and is making rapid progress towards a second one, on cloud services. The mandate has also expanded the Agency’s role in supporting capacity-building and preparedness capabilities, as well as operational cooperation - areas that continue to be put to the test during the COVID-19 pandemic. ENISA acted quickly at the onset of the pandemic by preparing awareness campaigns, sets of tools and publications offering in-depth guidance on cyber safety for organisations, businesses and citizens, all publically available on the webpage COVID19. Under its expanded role in policy development and implementation, ENISA has thrived, especially in the area of emerging technologies. For 5G security, ENISA has been involved in each phase and continues to support the European Commission and Member States as a common toolbox is being implemented. Last year, the Agency also supported the EU Member States with developing an EU-wide joint risk assessment regarding the 5G roll out, and delivered a 5G threat landscape report, which analyses threats at a more technical level. On Artificial Intelligence, the Agency has set up a 15-member ad-hoc working group on Cybersecurity for AI that will further advance European expertise on AI threats and solutions.

ENISA_NEWS_0119	2020-06-10	NEWS	ENISA working group on Artificial Intelligence cybersecurity kick-off	 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer in the realm of science fiction and futuristic scenarios. It is already changing everyday life, improving the provision of services by automating procedures and systems, and rapidly processing large amounts of data. AI has the potential to lead the digital transformation paradigm shift, and, in many ways, is already doing so. The benefits of Artificial Intelligence may only be attained if AI itself can be trustworthy and cybersecure. We are already witnessing attacks against AI systems that aim to negatively manipulate their behaviour and lead to unintentional operations by adversaries. The European Commission has highlighted the importance of AI in society and the economy; and, most recently, in its White Paper on Artificial Intelligence, the Commission has underlined the need for AI to be secure. This white paper is the frontrunner to forthcoming policy initiatives in the area that will shape the future of AI deployment and its wide adoption by the public. Recognizing the significance of cybersecurity for Artificial Intelligence, ENISA has set up an Ad-Hoc Working Group in line with the European Commission’s directions and policies. The main objectives of the group include: Advise ENISA in matters related to AI cybersecurity. Assist ENISA in the development of an AI Threat Landscape. Support ENISA in providing risk-proportionate cybersecurity guidelines for AI. The working group is composed of 15 members, representing stakeholders from small and large companies, the public sector, academia, associations, and more, as well as seven observers from European bodies, including the DG for Communications Networks, Content and Technology, the DG Joint Research Centre, Europol, the European Defence Agency (EDA) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).

ENISA_NEWS_0120	2020-06-09	NEWS	Spotlight on incident reporting of telecom security and trust services	 Today ENISA, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, releases a new version of CIRAS, a tool for statistical analysis of cybersecurity incidents. Two new sets of EU data on cybersecurity incident were made available: Telecom security incidents reported for the year 2019 Trust services security incidents for 2016-2019. The online visual tool, accessible to the public, now gives access to 8 years of telecom security incidents, and 4 years of trust services incident reports: a total of 1100 cybersecurity incidents. The new visual tool allows for analysis of multiannual trends.  Mandatory cybersecurity incident reporting is a corner stone of cybersecurity legislation in the EU. Cybersecurity incident reporting gives the national authorities in Europe vital information about the root causes and overall impact of major incidents. Every year national authorities send summaries of these major cybersecurity incidents to ENISA for aggregation and analysis at EU level. ENISA publishes statistics in yearly reports and gives access to aggregated and anonymised data in the online visual tool, to increase transparency about cybersecurity incidents. This online visual tool allows for custom analysis of trends and patterns. For example, the user is able to select a specific time-period or specific root cause categories and get custom statistics about detailed causes and assets affected. ENISA also maintains a private repository for the national authorities. You can access the tool via the following link: Cybersecurity Incident Report and Analysis System Background and legal base: ENISA has been supporting the EU telecom security authorities with the implementation of EU wide telecom breach reporting, under Article 13a of the Framework directive since 2010. Under this framework, ENISA develops procedures, templates, tooling and analysis and publishes an annual report with aggregated statistics about the telecom security incidents with significant impact since 2012. ENISA has been supporting supervisory bodies in the EU with cybersecurity breach reporting for trust services under Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation since 2016. Besides, ENISA also started to support the NIS cooperation group with the cybersecurity incident reporting along the provisions of the NIS Directive. ENISA will be publishing the detailed annual reports in the coming weeks. The following two trends are highlighted: Root causes of telecom security incidents Over the last 4 years, the most common root cause of telecom security incidents is system failures (412 out of 637 incidents). The second most common root cause is human errors with nearly a fifth of total incidents (19%, 119 incidents in total). Natural phenomena are the third root cause with 11% while only 4% of the incidents are categorized as malicious actions. Root cause categories of trust services security incidents Over the 4 years of trust services security incident reporting, the most common root cause is System failures (60%). Around a fifth of the reported incidents were due to human errors and a fifth of the incidents were flagged as malicious actions. Natural phenomena are not a common root cause in this sector. This sector operates differently than the telecom one. With large-scale aboveground infrastructure for the mobile networks, the telecom sector is more vulnerable to natural phenomena.

ENISA_NEWS_0121	2020-06-04	NEWS	Tips for secure user authentication 	 We are living in an era of large-scale data breaches. More and more high-profile companies are hacked; as a result, the personal data of millions of customers is leaked online. Cybercriminals with different motivations and interests take advantage of this data in order to mount attacks at both individuals and other organizations. As passwords are still the main method to authenticate users to platforms and systems, this article aims to provide tailored recommendations for improved cyber hygiene. Risks to passwords  Today, passwords can be stolen in multiple ways, including: Social Engineering attacks such as phishing credentials using fake pages, voice phishing (so-called Vishing), shoulder surfing (e.g. peeping behind a person who is typing their password on a laptop) and even retrieving handwritten passwords from post-it notes. Stealing using specialized software or physical keyloggers. Some of these attacks require a physical presence or proximity to a laptop or a device. By intercepting communications, using fake access points or by leveraging man-in-the-middle attacks (MiTM) at a network level, more prevalent in public WiFis found in hotels, cafés, airports, etc. Brute-force attacks on passwords by trying all the combinations, dictionary attacks or by simply guessing the password. Retrieving passwords directly from data breaches and leveraging them using password spraying techniques to other legitimate services. Recommendations to improve password security Activate multifactor authentication functionality whenever possible for all of your accounts. Do not re-use your passwords. Cybercriminals work under the assumption that many users re-use passwords, hence their high success rates for compromising accounts. Use single sign-on functionality combined with multifactor authentication in order to reduce the risk of account compromise. Use a password manager. Generate strong and unique passwords or passphrases according to the latest guidelines available, for each individual website and service. This is where password managers come in handy. Check if any your accounts appear in existing data breaches and act immediately by changing your passwords for the services identified. Many websites offer password reminder functionalities. Make sure you do not rely on easily retrievable personal information to reset your password, e.g. name of your pet, your date of birth, your high school, etc. Make use of VPNs or at least mobile access points when accessing e-Banking or other private services from public WiFi. Be aware of your surroundings in lounges, airports, trains and cafés, and make sure there is nobody behind you trying to snoop your password. This is where screen privacy filters come in handy. Do not leave your devices unattended/unlocked in public spaces such as hotels, public transport, lounges, etc. Further Information: For more security awareness related materials, please visit the website of the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) awareness raising activity coordinated by ENISA.

ENISA_NEWS_0123	2020-06-02	NEWS	Top ten cyber hygiene tips for SMEs during COVID-19 pandemic	 Crises like the current COVID-19 pandemic have a serious impact on the European as well as the International society and economy.  Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are often coping with difficult times.  Unfortunately, cybercriminals often see such crises as opportunities.  Phishing and ransomware attacks are on the rise. SMEs are also faced with a new reality where employees are working more from home.  This way they become even more dependent on Information Technology (IT) than before.  It goes without saying that protecting these virtual assets is of utmost importance to almost every SME.  According to ENISA, the top ten cyber hygiene topics that SMEs should address, possibly through outsourcing where needed, are presented below: Management buy-in. It is important that management sees the importance of cybersecurity for the organisation and that it is informed on a regular basis. Risk assessment. This answers the question: what do I have to protect and from what?  Identify and prioritise the main assets and threats your organisation is facing. Cybersecurity policy. Have the necessary policies in place to deal with cybersecurity and appoint someone, for example an Information Security Officer (ISO), who is responsible for overseeing the implementation of these policies. Awareness. Employees should understand the risks and should be informed about how to behave online.  People tend to forget such things rather rapidly, so repeating this every now and then can be valuable. Updates. Keeping everything, meaning servers, workstations, smartphones, etc. up-to-date is key in your cyber hygiene. Applying security updates is part of this process.  Ideally, this whole process is to a certain level automated and the updates can be tested in a testing environment. Backups. Prior to doing these updates it is vital to have good backups in place.  This will also protect the environment from attacks such as ransomware.  Backup the most important data often and think about the cost of losing data during a certain timespan.  Keep the backups offline, test the backups and try to have duplication of the backups. Access management. Have rules/policies in place for access management and enforce them.  Make sure default passwords are changed for example, that passwords are not shared, etc. Endpoint protection. Think about securing the endpoints through for example installing antivirus software. Secure remote access. Limit remote access as much as possible and where absolutely needed, enable it but in a secure way.  Make sure that communication is encrypted properly. Incident management plan. There should be a plan on how to handle an incident when it occurs.  Different realistic scenarios could be part of this plan.  Get to know whom you could contact when things are problematic, for instance the national CSIRT.   Further Information For further information related to the cybersecurity aspects of the COVID19 pandemic, consult the ENISA pages dedicated to this issue under the Topic - COVID19 For press questions and interviews, please contact press (at) enisa.europa.eu   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0124	2020-05-29	NEWS	Getting ready for the next security incidents 	 As of April 2020, more than 500 European incidents response teams are listed in the ENISA CSIRTs by Country - Interactive Map. These teams work on a daily basis to improve the prevention, detection and analysis of cyber threats and incidents. As envisioned by the NIS Directive and in the Cybersecurity Act ENISA is given the responsibility to assist the CSIRTs Network and the Member States in improving the prevention, detection and capability to respond to cyber threats and incidents by providing them with knowledge and expertise. It is within this context that ENISA launched this project in order to improve the proactive detection of network security incidents in the EU, by: Providing an inventory of available measures and information sources; Identifying good practices; Recommending possible areas for development. In this respect, proactive detection of incidents is defined as the process of discovery of malicious activity in a team's constituency through internal monitoring tools or external services that publish information about detected incidents, before the affected constituents become aware of the problem. ENISA published the first version of a study entitled “Proactive detection of network security incidents” in 2011. The current work builds and expands on this. It aims to provide a complete inventory of all available methods, tools, activities and information sources for proactive detection of network security incidents. Such tools are used already or could possibly be used by incident response teams in Europe nowadays. This study identifies the evolution of proactive detection in EU over time, between 2011 and 2019. It also explores new areas that could help improving operational cooperation and information exchange. The goal is to help both new teams that are starting to use new tools and sources, and more advanced teams to assess their level and identify what they could still improve. Moreover, this work can be used together with the recently released ENISA training on Orchestration of CSIRT Tools or to conduct more focused peer reviews using ENISA maturity methodology. The results of the project are divided in three reports and in a living repository hosted on GitHub. The objective is to offer a point of reference for new or well-established teams who need to identify or reassess appropriate measures for proactive detection of incidents. 1- Report - Survey results Survey among incident response teams in Europe; Comparison with the 2011 survey. 2- Report - Measures and information sources Inventory of available methods, tools, activities and information sources; Evaluation of identified measures and information sources. 3- Report - Good practices gap analysis recommendations Analysis of the data gathered; Recommendations. 4- Online repository - GitHub Information sources; Measures and tools.   Proactive detection of incidents: Further information: ENISA - CSIRT Services section ENISA - CSIRTs and communities section ENISA - CSIRTs in Europe section Brochure - Bolstering Incident Response in Europe For more questions you can contact CSIRT-Relations (at) enisa.europa.eu For press questions and interviews press (at) enisa.europa.eu   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0125	2020-05-18	NEWS	Securing smart infrastructure during the COVID-19 pandemic	 The  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  has changed the  way  people  live,  do  business,  and  interact.  Buildings and homes are becoming smarter, more complex and more connected. This massive interconnection leads to new  efficiencies  and capabilities and  unlocks  enormous  value  for  consumers,  organizations  and  cities. Nevertheless, these advantages come with great challenges and cyber security risks. Securing smart homes and smart buildings from cyber security risks becomes more relevant than ever in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. People are spending considerable time at home using smart cameras, wearables and telecommunications to remain in touch with their business, doctors, government, school, friends and family. Utilizing modern technology people stay productive for their work and their housekeeping, but they also become more susceptible to attacks from threat actors that are still looking to cash in by exploiting human nature. ENISA’s Work on IoT and Smart Infrastructure The Agency has been working on IoT security for a number of years, producing, among other things, work on Security and Resilience of Smart Home Environments, Baseline IoT security recommendations, as well as work in securing Industry 4.0, and IoT software development lifecycle. For more information: enisa.europa.eu/iot Securing the home Social distancing has shifted daily habits with activities pertinent to work, education, healthcare, wellbeing and socialisation happening mainly from home. Most of these activities are taking place in digital format and therefore they rely heavily on connectivity and smart home devices. Many consumers are aware that their smart devices could potentially introduce vulnerabilities in their home network and they should configure them properly. However, they struggle to understand what is required of them to keep their smart thermostat or voice assistants secure. Below, ENISA presents some fundamental measures for securing smart devices: Use long passwords, two-factor or multi-factor authentication and, if available, enable biometric features or additional PINs. Use different passwords for each device in your home network. Observe user guides and enable the relevant security features during the initial setup. Enable update notifications and perform updates on a regular basis Avoid introducing sensitive information and be aware of the way your information is used. Turn off and unplug the device when no longer used Configure multiple networks on your router and keep your smart devices on a separate Wi-Fi network. Securely wipe your smart device and use “factory reset” function before disposing or returning it back. Securing the business premises Almost overnight, in an effort of implementing immediately social distancing, many employees around the globe started working remotely from home and staying away from offices. Outside of the normal and business-as-usual situation, with applying social distancing rules and personnel working in rotation, employees might simply be less diligent about security practices. It has never been more important to proactively secure smart buildings/offices, which they often control systems or operations like data centers dependent on the availability of air conditioning systems. Securing networks, monitoring network anomalies, identifying malicious behaviour including social engineering and spear phishing attempts and reviewing IoT security configurations is the way forward and in that respect, ENISA provides the following recommendations in addition to the ones mentioned above:   Enable firewall protection, and ensure corporate network is only accessible from whitelisted services.   Disable unused ports.  Apply network micro-segmentation by creating virtual networks to isolate IoT systems from other critical IT systems.  Enable monitoring and diagnostics and review them regularly. Prepare and update the incident response plans according to the current risks.    Smart homes and smart buildings have become the digital shelters for all people in social distancing. Securing them is a shared responsibility and everyone should take part in achieving a more secure and resilient digital environment both at home and at work.

ENISA_NEWS_0126	2020-05-12	NEWS	Dependency of Energy Operators  on time sensitive services	 Energy grids depend on precision timing and communication networks to monitor grid operation and integration. Power data acquisition and synchronization need to share time sources to enable decentralized analysis and effective coordination of power production. However, systems that provide time services are vulnerable to various cyber threats and a possible attack can destabilise the operation of modern power grids. With recent technological advances, there is a proliferation of tools for deploying attacks against the time sources of a utility. The ENISA Report - Power Sector Dependency on Time Service: attacks against time sensitive services focuses on such an attack scenario by identifying relevant risks and by providing guidelines to ensure consistent time synchronization. In doing so, a typical functional architecture for time-phase data processing on the power grid is presented.  The study also includes a list of attack vectors of potential threats against communication mediums, protocols as well as sensors and devices of this architecture. Technical and generic good practices are suggested based on the scenario technologies investigated. The report concludes with key recommendations such as: Designing of modern devices for substation automation (including GPS receivers) with security in mind (vendors); Establishing electronic perimeters and implementing measures against spoofing attacks (operators); Systematic implementation of basic measures for substations (operators); Designing of modern devices to be used for automation in a way that meets universally accepted requirements and implementing of selected security measures through proper standardisation procedures (vendors); Adoption of tools and procedures to enhance the resilience of power grids with respect tomalformed and/ or injected data affecting decision making in modern smart grids (operators).

ENISA_NEWS_0127	2020-05-11	NEWS	Cybersecurity in the healthcare sector during COVID-19 pandemic	 The COVID19 pandemic has created a new reality for the healthcare sector globally testing its limits. Adding to the overwhelming situation it is currently facing, the sector has become a direct target or collateral victim of cybersecurity attacks. Malicious actors taking advantage of the COVID19 pandemic have already launched a series of phishing campaigns and ransomware attacks. Hospitals have shifted their focus and resources to their primary role, managing this extraordinary emergency, which has placed them in a vulnerable situation. Hospitals, and the whole healthcare sector, now have to be prepared. Cybercrime adapts to the world around it. It is hardly surprising that in the beginning of an escalating global pandemic like COVID-19, malware actors have jumped on the bandwagon. The current situation in the EU and worldwide provides a fertile breeding ground for various campaigns. In no particular order, the following conditions are being exploited making the sector even more vulnerable: High demand for certain goods like protective masks, disinfectants and household products Decreased mobility and border closures Increasing reliance on teleworking, often with little previous experience and planning Increased fear, uncertainty and doubt in the general population ENISA can provide some advice to support the sector, taking into account the situational evolution and most common incidents since the beginning of the pandemic. Share the information with healthcare staff in the organisation, build awareness of the ongoing situation and, in the case of infection, ask staff to disconnect from the network to contain the spread. Raise awareness internally in healthcare organisations and hospitals by launching campaigns even during the time of crisis (i.e. to inform hospital staff not to open suspicious emails). In case of systems compromise, freeze any activity in the system. Disconnect the infected machines from others and from any external drive or medical device. Go offline from the network. Immediately contact the national CSIRT. Ensure business continuity through effective backup and restore procedures. Business continuity plans should be established whenever the failure of a system may disrupt the hospital's core services and the role of the supplier is such cases must be well-defined. In case of impact to medical devices, incident response should be coordinated with the device manufacturer. Collaborate with vendors for incident response in case of medical devices or clinical information systems. One preparedness measure is network segmentation. With network segmentation network traffic can be isolated and / or filtered to limit and / or prevent access between network zones. The whole cybersecurity community is working together to support the healthcare sector as the pandemic develops; national cybersecurity authorities are issuing alerts and guidelines (e.g. the situation in CZ) on potential cyber attacks; in the CSIRT Network MS continuously exchange information and issue situational reports together with the EU Institutions; the private sector is offering pro-bono cybersecurity related services supporting the healthcare sector.

ENISA_NEWS_0130	2020-05-06	NEWS	Understanding and dealing with phishing during the COVID-19 pandemic	 Phishing in the years of COVID-19 Many organisations and companies experience changes in their working conditions lately due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This shift has increased remote activities, such as teleworking. Teleworking furthers the reliance on email for communication, thus creating perfect conditions for email fraud schemes. Cyber criminals are taking advantage of the pandemic by using widespread awareness of the subject to trick users into revealing their personal information or clicking on malicious links or attachments, unwittingly downloading malware to their computers. They may even impersonate government organisations, ministries of health, centres for public health or important figures in a relevant country in order to disguise themselves as reliable sources. The emails look authentic and may include logos or branding of the specific organisations. COVID-19 AND PHISHINGEmail phishing attacks have spiked over 600% since the end of February 2020 due to Coronavirus pandemic. (infosecurity-magazine) How scammers operate Malicious email messages that might ask you to open an attachment supposedly containing pertinent information regarding the Coronavirus are likely to download malicious software onto your device as soon as you click on the attachment or embedded link. This software could allow cybercriminals to take control of your computer, log your keystrokes or access your personal information and financial data, which could lead to identity theft. How to recognize phishing The emails sent usually: look identical to messages from a reputable organisation (such as a medical or governmental institution), sound urgent or try to spread fear, claim to enclose important information or breaking news, ask you to download and/or click on attachments and links. How to Protect against Phishing Attacks There are simple steps you can take to avoid the bait: 1)  Take time to reflect on a request for your personal information and whether the request is appropriate. Do not open unsolicited email from people unfamiliar to you or click on suspicious attachments, which you did not expect. 2)  Never supply any personal or financial information and passwords to anyone via email. 3)  Avoid emails that insist you act now. Phishing emails often try to create a sense of urgency or demand immediate action.   4)  Look for wording and terminology. Apart from phishing, cyber criminals could also trap a specific person via spear phishing using the receiver’s full name. Check for terms and language that is normally expected in the type of email you receive. 5)  Check the email address. Check the sender’s name, email address and whether the email domain matches the organisation that the sender claims to be from. If not, it is probably a phishing attempt. 6)  Check the link before you click. See your emails in plain text to check for the hyperlinked address to see the real hyperlink. If it is not the same as what appears in the email, it is probably a phishing attempt. 7)  Keep an eye out for spelling and grammatical mistakes. If an email includes spelling, punctuation and/or grammar errors, it could be a phishing email. 8)  Be wary of third-party sources spreading information about COVID-19. Refer to the official websites for updates on COVID-19. Fraudulent e-mails can look like they come from a real organisation but legitimate government agencies will never call you or email you directly for this information. 9) Protect your devices. Install anti-spam, anti-spyware and anti-virus software and make sure they are always up to date. 10) Visit websites by typing the domain name yourself. Most businesses use encryption and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS). If you receive a certificate error while browsing, consider it as a warning sign that something is not right with the website. What happens if I became a victim of phishing?  If you have clicked on a link or opened an attachment that downloaded harmful software, update your computer’s security software and run a scan. If you entered login credentials to access information, change them immediately. If you have provided your bank details, contact your bank or credit card company. Take actions COVID-19 has affected millions of people around the world, while its long-term impact remains to be seen. However, protecting ourselves against coronavirus-related scams is both a feasible and essential step. If you receive a phishing email, you should: Report it to your IT department by forwarding it as an attachment. Delete it. Notify the organization being spoofed in order to prevent other people from being victimized.

ENISA_NEWS_0131	2020-05-04	NEWS	What is a CSIRT and how can it help me?	 With the COVID-19 outbreak, many SMEs and businesses had to make a giant and fast leap into remote working, completely relying on the Internet for their business models. This means facing everyday a new kind of cyber threat by enabling employees to work online from home, buy and sell goods online and rely on virtual meetings for everyday decisions. Citizens are also heavily depending on the Internet to maintain contact with other workers and their loved ones, stream content and news, use e-health services, online shopping, schooling and every other activity that has been moved online. Even if far away, we have never been so close. There are currently more than 500 Computer Incident Response Teams (CSIRT) in Europe covering the needs of large companies, SMEs, private citizens, governments, research and education institutions. These teams are at the front line to respond to cyber security incidents and attacks. ENISA offers an interactive map of currently known Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs): the CSIRTs Map. This tool can help  identify the right team for businesses and consumers facing cyber incidents and attacks and dealing with this giant leap into working from home. Moreover, since 2017, European Union Member States have established a new and unique level of EU cooperation in case of large scale and cross border cyber security incidents: the CSIRTs Network. The first piece of cybersecurity legislation in the EU, known as the NIS Directive, established the CSIRTs Network, which is composed of incident response teams appointed by the Member States and the EU institutions. These teams are responding to cybersecurity incidents in each Member State and work together to protect EU citizens and businesses. During these difficult times for the Union, the CSIRTs Network members continuously exchange cybersecurity related information, which may affect European business and citizens. The Network is ready to respond to COVID-19 related cyber threats. A weekly report to the EU and MS higher levels/and their constituencies is produced by the Network, providing summaries and recommendations on how to face the cyber threats related to the outbreak. The goal of the CSIRTs Network is to enable its member to cooperate, exchange info on cyber threats, improve the handling of cross border cyber incidents and respond in a coordinated manner to a situation like the one we are facing today. The CSIRTs Network objective is to provide the highest level of incident response in Europe. In case you do not know already the CSIRTs Network member for your country, please visit the dedicated website CSIRTs Network and check out your appointed CSIRTs Network member website, where you can find information and advisories on how to deal with COVID19 related cyber threats in your national languages. In case your company wants to set up an incident response team, since 2004, ENISA has been supporting the Incident Response community to build and advance capabilities by providing capacity-building opportunities and by publishing over 70 dedicated studies and practices. You can find all them on the ENISA website under the Publication section together with more than 40 dedicated trainings free for download and use covering four main areas: Technical, Operational, Setting up a CSIRT and Legal & Cooperation. The goal is to support EU Member States and businesses to protect the Digital Single Market, raise the next generation of cybersecurity professionals, improve national incident response capabilities and help operators of essential services, digital services providers and businesses to prevent incidents and protect assets in their networks. In case your company already has an incident response team, you can assess where it is and how it can further advance by using the ENISA CSIRT maturity assessment model and evaluation methodology with the online tool: CSIRT Maturity - Self-assessment Tool.

ENISA_NEWS_0133	2020-04-27	NEWS	Tips for selecting and using online communication tools	 The coronavirus outbreak has affected and changed the way small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) across the EU are doing business, both internally and externally with suppliers and customers. Indeed, SMEs face the new challenge of working remotely in a way that it is still productive, efficient but also secure. Online communication tools (including video/audio conferencing, instant messaging, remote document sharing/file exchange, internet streaming) are key to help SMEs follow-up with these novel working regimes. Among other aspects, the security and privacy settings of such tools are fundamental for efficient operation. Taking into consideration the variety of online communications tools available today, ENISA offers some practical advice to SMEs with regard to the security and privacy aspects that should be considered upon the selection and use of online communication tools. Tips for the selection of an online communication tool Make sure that the tool supports encrypted communication. It is especially recommended to rely on tools that support end-to-end encryption and provide sufficient information on applied key-sizes and algorithms. Opt for a choice that supports centralized management, such as call restriction policy, password policy, virtual meeting rooms and eavesdropping prevention. Assess the security settings, in particular make sure that the tool supports strong authentication, such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Review carefully the configuration options, considering in particular whether the service can be run in-house or relies only on external storage of data; if possible, prefer in-house implementations and ensure that integration with existing business tools and/or Single Sign On (SSO) can be provided. Read the privacy policy of the tool carefully, in particular as regards the following key aspects: types of personal data stored by the tool; location of the data; possible transfers of data to third countries; retention periods of data; default privacy settings/behaviour of the tool. Make sure that the app does not send data to social media for advertisement or other unwanted purposes. Consult your Data Protection Officer (or your privacy contact person if you do not have a DPO) if available for further assessment in case of doubt. Utilize available work resources such as work email and laptop to access the service; restrict if possible use from personal devices. In case it is necessary to use the tool from mobile phones, verify the permissions that the tool (app) asks and advise the users accordingly (e.g. for participation to a telephone call, granting permission for access to camera or location data would not be required). Ensure that only official distributions of the client are used and if it is not possible prefer the use of the web client. Verify that the latest version of the software is used and that security patches are applied in a timely manner. Make sure all meetings are password protected. Avoid sharing conference links and meeting passwords outside the intended participants. Invite users from within the tool if possible and ask them to refrain from sharing the link. In case that Single Sign On is not supported, advise all users to protect their account by selecting strong passwords and enabling multi factor authentication. Verify the default settings of the tool and make sure that all users are aware of them. Apply, where possible, default settings that protect users’ privacy (e.g. video deactivated by default, no audio/video recording, no central storage of instant messages, etc.). Refrain from recording the meetings unless there is a specific need for this. In case of recording, ensure that all meeting participants are informed and agree with the recording. Advice the users to use the chat, audio, camera and screen sharing functions wisely. For example, it advisable to not use video on a call when it is not needed. Moreover, users should ensure that only the window they want to share is on their screen and they should prevent their email or chats from becoming visible during meetings. When using video, users should make sure that their background is neutral and does not reveal any personal data of theirs or other confidential information.

ENISA_NEWS_0134	2020-04-24	NEWS	New Training: on orchestration of CSIRT Tools	 ENISA puts great effort into supporting the development of EU Member States’ national incident response preparedness. To that purpose, ENISA updated its CSIRT training material aimed at improving the skills of CSIRT teams. The scope of this new training is to adapt to new technologies and best practices in a fast changing domain. The updated material will help to reinforce Member States CSIRTs’ operational skills and capacities. It will specifically allow them to manage the constant stream of cyber security events in an efficient way by showing them how to introduce smartly interconnected popular tools in their incident handling processes: the first step of so-called “orchestration” of tools.  Access the ENISA Orchestration of CSIRT Tools Training Course The purpose of the training is to educate  Member States by: teaching how some popular tools can be interconnected, leading to a more efficient and better incident response, automatically enriching the information on incidents and events they receive and increasing the amount of data they can share back much faster to their peers. The new training materials consist of independent modules, each covering a particular combination of tools. The modules not only cover the configuration aspects of interconnecting the tools but also show how security analysts can use these orchestrated tools in their daily duties. The underlying technical framework developed for this training allows modifying and extending the training courses to adapt to the fast evolving landscape of CSIRT tools and techniques. The training materials are therefore custom made  reusable and future-proof. This is a major novel change in approach to the technical trainings offered by ENISA. Scope of the training The training is divided in two parts, each with a different target audience. The first -part is dedicated to the technical aspects of setting up the orchestration. It allows participants to practice with a selection of commonly used and very powerful open-source tools, such as: MISP; a Threat Intelligence Platform for receiving and sharing information with other security actors; TheHive and Cortex: a case management and team collaboration tool; Elasticsearch and Kibana: for convenient and scalable storage of security data, query and visualisation purposes. The second part deals with analytical workflows, focusing on leading simple investigations designed as training scenarios. Each of the scenarios demonstrates how the selection of tools can facilitate a typical CSIRT workflow. The emphasis is laid on the benefits that result from smartly interconnecting multiple CSIRT tools Supporting the CSIRT analysts; Improving the team’s situational awareness; Reducing response times. Easy sharing of own findings with the other security communities of choice. Another interesting feature is that the approach is modular: the trainer can instantly deploy different sections of the training independently.  The trainer can start with a module that teaches how to connect some tools, followed by an analysis scenario that demonstrates the added value of interconnecting. Every module can be instantly deployed with all tools correctly configured and all the data needed for the scenario in place. Architecture of the Platform The infrastructure of the training is based on state of the art open-source containerization and orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes and Helm. This approach allows simplifying future continuous developments by adding new tools, rearranging existing ones and adding more analyst scenarios. Moreover, the solution can be adapted to work natively in a cloud hosted infrastructure; removing the need for local setup of the environment and streamlining the complete training process. It was also conceived to be modular by design, allowing thorough customisation of training delivery.

ENISA_NEWS_0135	2020-04-23	NEWS	Encrypted Traffic Analysis: Use Cases & Security Challenges	 The objective of the ENISA Report - Encrypted Traffic Analysis is to highlight an oxymoron, the disrupting effects of encryption network security. It examines whether Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can be a useful alternative for network administrators and security professionals, offering encrypted traffic analysis capabilities without requiring access to decrypted packet payload. It also discusses  the privacy dangers introduced by the inappropriate use of ML and AI, alerting decision makers of potential risks that may lie in the future. Background The introduction of network traffic encryption has significantly improved communication security and user privacy. When using technologies, like Transport Layer Security (TLS), most internet users assume that third parties cannot gain access to their communications and companies rest assured that their transactions are safe from interference and eavesdropping. However, widespread network traffic encryption has reduced the ability of network administrators to monitor their infrastructures. Crippling their success in dealing with malicious traffic and sensitive data exfiltration, forcing them to resort to traffic decryption through proxies. Research in ML and AI has provided us with useful tools for combating cyberattacks. At the same time, these new capabilities can be misused to lower user privacy, sometimes even with encryption employed. Scope of the report  The new report explores the current state of affairs in Encrypted Traffic Analysis. To that purpose, research and methods are evaluated through the following essential use cases: Application identification; Network analytics; User information identification; Detection of encrypted malware; File/Device/Website/Location fingerprinting; DNS tunnelling detection. The analysis of these use cases shows that the techniques presented are very promising. While not achieving the same level of confidence as with analysing unencrypted data, in some scenarios the benefits might outweigh the loss in detection accuracy. The report highlights how the misuse of ML and AI techniques can lower privacy expectations for users, even though they might use strong encryption. One of these techniques is fingerprinting. Certain properties of encrypted data may allow the creation of data records mapping the properties to corresponding files or websites, providing ways to infer which files, songs, videos, etc. a user is requesting, even though the traffic itself is properly encrypted. The report also identifies common TLS misconfigurations and bad practices that endanger the confidentiality of communications and users’ privacy, and urges administrators to follow simple countermeasures like: Certification validation and pinning; Minimizing exposed data over HTTP redirects; Deprecating older certificates; Usage of certificate signing and trusted CAs; etc. These  misconfigurations, which are often easily fixed, deter users from trusting online services and make them avoid online transactions, negatively affecting the Digital Single Market.

ENISA_NEWS_0136	2020-04-22	NEWS	European Cybersecurity Month: highlights of the 2019 Campaign	 Every year, together with the participating Member States, ENISA organises the European Cybersecurity Month, the EU advocacy campaign on cybersecurity for the EU citizens. 2019 saw the deployment of the 7th edition of the awareness raising campaign supported by the European Commission, Europol’s Cyber Crime Centre (EC3), European Schoolnet, and cybersecurity organisations from the participating Member States. One of the objectives of the 2019 campaign is to ensure end-users and organisations are safe online. The general intention is to help EU citizens develop a basic understanding of the different types of online security and privacy issues. Other objectives of the Cybersecurity Month are: To promote cyber hygiene best practices, To highlight existing recommendations; To increase the participation of EU Member States and relevant stakeholders. The ENISA - ECSM Deployment Report 2019 reveals the increased impact of the 2019 campaign and the positive outcomes of the activities performed. Policy Contex The European Cybersecurity Month is part of the actions designed to implement the provisions of the Cybersecurity Act (CSA), article 10, under Title II, chapter 2 on awareness raising and education. The CSA mandates ENISA to organise regular outreach campaigns in cooperation with Member States, Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. To that end, ENISA assists Member States in their efforts to raise cybersecurity awareness and promote cybersecurity education throughout the Union. Objectives The purpose of the report is to provide an overview of the activities organised in 2019.  The synthesis of the findings is based on evaluation and performance information gathered via two questionnaires and media monitoring data. Content & Highlights The report includes information on planning and execution as well as an evaluation of the campaign. The 2019 campaign focused on delivery of live social media sessions and gamification sessions. Consequently, ENISA invested in developing digital content for online dissemination and proposed live virtual events and Q&A sessions on Twitter to engage with the public. Morevoer, a total of four social media quizzes were designed and posted every week. The EU Member States coordinators agreed to organise the event around two themes; cyber hygiene and emerging technology, to allow for extended coverage of each theme and to facilitate the campaign’s measurement. The 2019 campaign includes a significant increase in the following: Member States participation; Twitter activities with total of retweets that doubled compared to 2018; Total number of views for digital media coverage. Although there were less conferences and workshops organised by Member States, they attracted nearly three times more visitors than the previous years. The survey questionnaire sent to the Member States coordinators revealed how well the organisation of the ECSM was perceived. It also showed how the ECSM is considered to add substantial value to the national campaigns and is seen as a practical and positive opportunity to improve collaboration with other Member States. Target Audience The report is intended for those public and private organisations, which supported the ECSM or intend to do so in the future. IT security professionals and/or groups who attended events and conferences organised throughout Europe will also find it a useful source of information. In addition, the report targets EU and national policy makers who aim to improve the security awareness for citizens, professionals and IT end-users in general.

ENISA_NEWS_0137	2020-04-15	NEWS	Underpinning software security: the role of the EU cybersecurity certification framework	 Secure software development and maintenance is attracting a lot of attention lately, due to the rapidly increased dependency of everyday products, services and processes to the underlying software. Quite often, weaknesses behind security incidents and/or breaches materialize due to the lack of adherence on fundamental security principles and techniques. In order to promote increased levels of security and to improve mitigation of known security threats, secure software development and maintenance is becoming increasingly subject to evaluation, and eventually certification. The ENISA Report - Advancing Software Security in the EU discusses some key elements of software security and provides an overview of the most relevant existing approaches and standards while identifying shortcomings associated with the secure software development landscape. Lastly, it provides a number of practical considerations relevant to the different aspects of software development within the EU cybersecurity certification framework. These considerations include: issues related to the deployment and maintenance of repositories not only for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities but also for shared security aspects of certified products, services and processes; coordination of activities among European Standards Organizations (ESOs) and Standards Developing Organization (SDOs); possibilities to complement EU cybersecurity certification schemes with guidelines for software development, maintenance and operation; consideration of lightweight conformity assessment methods for basic assurance level  as a response to the existing fragmented landscape of software development and maintenance; possibilities to leverage existing experience and expertise and promote the uptake of EU cybersecurity certification schemes The study was conducted as part of the Agency’s preparatory and support activities in the area of certification of products, services and processes. It is envisioned to be used as a reference document that complements similar ongoing initiatives at National level, during drafting of candidate cybersecurity certification schemes and as a non-binding guidance document for EU cybersecurity certification framework stakeholders.   Further Information The ENISA Report - Advancing Software Security in the EU For interviews and press enquires, please contact press@enisa.europa.eu   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0138	2020-04-14	NEWS	Earning Trust: ENISA on eID and Trust services	 In a shift of scope from mere electronic signatures to developed Trust services, the eIDAS Regulation has enabled the use of electronic identification and trust services by citizens, businesses and public administrations alike, to access online services or manage electronic transactions. Both interoperability and mutual recognition of electronic identification schemes across borders have been further enhanced to include five types of trust services, namely, electronic: Signatures; Seals; Time stamps; Registered delivery services; Website authentication certificates. Since 2013 ENISA has been in the forefront of the developments in eIDAS and has been supporting the Commission and the Member States in the area of trust services by: Making available security recommendations for the implementation of trust services; Mapping technical and regulatory requirements; Promoting the deployment of qualified trust services in Europe; Supporting relying parties and end users to secure their electronic transactions using trust services. The recently enacted Cybersecurity Act provides ENISA with an extended mandate to explore the area of eIDs included in the eIDAS regulation. Therefore, in 2019 ENISA produced two reports on assessing the relevance of specific standards to the implementation of eIDAs and two reports exploring the harmonisation of security requirements for QTSPs and the technological landscape for eID schemes.  Towards a harmonised Conformity Assessment Scheme for QTSP/QTS The eIDAS Regulation requires CABs to be accredited in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 [Reg.765, 2008], which is the generic European regulation in relation to accreditation. It furthermore requires that the conformity assessment scheme (CAS) used by the CAB is eIDAS specific. A specific feature of the eIDAS accreditation scheme recommended by EA, and intrinsically of the eIDAS Regulation as the normative document, is that the requirements against which the QTSP/QTS must be certified are technology neutral legal requirements, expressed in terms of functional objectives. Furthermore, no standard may be mandatorily imposed upon the QTSP for providing QTS in conformance with the Regulation in order not to negatively impact innovation and/or harm competition. In addition, no eIDAS secondary legislation has been adopted to date to reference any standard that would create a legal presumption of compliance with any requirement of the eIDAS Regulation for the QTSP. As a result, there is a significant margin for policy choices in creating, interpreting and applying accreditation and certification approaches. The difference in the approach and in the assessment effort for accreditation of CABs and for the certification of QTSP/QTS is reported by a vast majority of stakeholders (including EA) as hindering the mutual recognition of accredited certification of electronic trust services. The report of ENISA aims to propose ways in which the eIDAS assessment regime can be strengthened based on the current regime of the eIDAS Regulation, the stakeholders’ concerns and the legitimate need to move towards a more harmonised approach with regards to the assessment by CABs of the conformity of QTSP/QTSs with the requirements of that Regulation. It focusses in particular on actions towards a harmonised conformity assessment scheme for QTSP/QTS. Proposed actions consider legal instruments, the design of a harmonised CAS, continuous improvement of CAS and recommendations that can be implemented in the short term. ENISA Report - Overview of standards related to eIDAS The shift to eID Under the eIDAS Regulation, Member States have to notify electronic identification (eID) schemes to a designated service of the European Commission. Since 29 September 2018, mandatory mutual recognition of notified eID schemes has come into force. As a notified Member State’s scheme should currently be used to access online public services provided by another Member State, consistent security across these eID schemes is critical. The study of ENISA provides an overview of the technological landscape for the eID schemes. Such an overview can underpin the development of a framework that will take into account security considerations that are required throughout the electronic identification process, including the enrolment phase, the eID means management, authentication and providers’ management and organisation. The paper also elaborates on topics worth being developed into guidelines to ensure homogeneity and consistency across Europe, including for instance remote identification (which is also a key topic for trust services), the security of mobile-based eID solutions, use of smartphones built-in biometric sensors, admissibility of SMS OTP and certification frameworks. Given the new mandate that stems from the Cybersecurity Act, this report also describes the role of a ENISA in the area of eID schemes. ENISA Report - eIDAS compliant eID Solutions Overview of standards: specifying formats of advanced electronic signatures and seals The eIDAS Regulation provides the regulatory framework in the EU for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market.  The creation, verification, validation and preservation of electronic signatures or electronic seals relies (among others) on standards specifying electronic signatures and seals formats to guarantee interoperability and their general usability within the Member States and across borders.  Member States can recognize XML, CMS or PDF advanced electronic signatures based on the formats respectively named XAdES, CAdES or PAdES, or associated signature containers based on ASiC if they meet technical specifications issued by ETSI. ETSI has published a set of European standards (ENs) taking into account the eIDAS Regulation requirements and addressing a number of issues that have been identified, based on the feedback received from the stakeholders, for example during CAdES/XAdES/PAdES/ASiC ETSI Plugtests™ events. The scope of this document is to assess the suitability of the recently published ENs to meet the eIDAS Regulation requirements for the purpose of updating the list of standards referenced. It also aims at evaluating the consequences of such update and defines the timeline for a possible transition to the exclusive usage of the new ENs. ENISA Report - Overview of standards relate to eIDAS Assessment of the eligibility of referencing ETSI TS 119 403-3 in eIDAS The eIDAS Regulation introduced provisions at the EU level in relation to qualified trust service providers (QTSPs) listed in the Regulation, and to the qualified trust services (QTSs) they provide. Supervisory bodies in the Member States scrutinise and approve Trust Service Providers and the Qualified Trust Services available. The eIDAS Regulation does not specify any particular accreditation scheme or any conformity assessment (or certification) scheme against which a CAB must be accredited. This results in practice in divergence across conformity assessment schemes used by CABs. This report concludes that a suitable candidate standard pursuant to Art.20(4) is [ETSI TS 119 403-3], which sets additional requirements for CABs assessing EU QTSPs in addition to [ETSI EN 319 403], and [ISO/IEC 17065] to specify requirements for CABs assessing TSPs. ENISA Report - Assessment of ETSI TS 119 403-3 related to eIDAS Trust Services Forum – save the date! On the 22nd September, ENISA in collaboration with the European Commission is organizing, for the sixth consecutive year, the Trust Services Forum, collocated with D-TRUST/TUVIT CA Day. The event will take place in Berlin, Germany, provided that the current traveling and gathering restrictions are lifted. As in the previous years, the Forum will focus on emerging issues related to trust services across Europe, in the period of the first review of the application of the eIDAS Regulation, and in particular will aim to: Share good practices and experience on the implementation of trust services; Discuss the latest developments on the framework surrounding trust service providers including standards, implementing acts and technical guidelines; Exchange views on identified implementation and operational issues of qualified trust services; Discuss strategies to promote the adoption of qualified trust services.

ENISA_NEWS_0139	2020-04-06	NEWS	ENISA publishes a Tool for the Mapping of Dependencies to International Standards	 Objective The web tool presents the mapping of the indicators demonstrated in the report Good practices on interdependencies between OES and DSPs to international information security standards. This report analysed the dependencies and interdependencies between Operators of Essential Services (OES) and Digital Service Providers (DSPs) and identified a number of indicators to assess them. These indicators are mapped to international standards and frameworks, namely ISO IEC 27002, COBIT5, the NIS Cooperation Group security measures and NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Context Due to the digitalisation of services, all major sectors have an increasing level of cyber (inter)dependencies on digital infrastructures and DSPs. Integrating the assessment of (inter)dependencies in an overall risk management process is a complex process, particularly in the case of cross-sector or cross-border dependencies and interdependencies. The following framework was used to identify, analyse these interdependencies and then define the (inter)dependencies’ indicators.   Tool The tool contributes to the NIS Directive (Article 3) objective for a common and converged level of security in network and information systems at EU level. It does not intend to replace existing standards, frameworks or good-practices in use by OESs. By using this tool, security experts may: Describe the interdependencies among OES and DSP in a straightforward  and comprehensive manner; Easily identify risk assessment practices for the evaluation of the potential impact of interdependencies; Define good practices for assessing interdependencies stemming from international standards and frameworks.

ENISA_NEWS_0140	2020-04-02	NEWS	Supporting the fight against cybercrime	 In an effort to further enhance the cooperation between the CSIRTs, especially national and governmental, and law enforcement agencies (LEAs), ENISA has carried out a survey and analysis of significant issues at hand that are likely to inhibit cooperation. As ENISA usually takes a holistic view of the policy area of CSIRT and LEA cooperation, interactions with the judiciary have also been taken into consideration to the extent possible. The result of this study is a Roadmap on the cooperation between CSIRTS and LE. The fight against cybercrime requires the involvement of Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), which supported by CSIRTs are likely to be better positioned to investigate complex criminal structures. This picture is incomplete though, unless interactions with the judiciary are equally taken into account due to the pre-eminent role it plays across the Member States in terms of directing criminal investigations. When CSIRTs, LEAs and the judiciary cooperate, they face challenges that previously, have been categorized, by ENISA as being technical, legal, organizational and/or human behaviour as they associate with organisational culture. Understanding these challenges is essential in an effort to tackle them, further enhance the cooperation and thus stand a better chance in the fight against cybercrime. Fighting agains Cybercrime: Roles and duties of CSIRTs, LE and Judiciary In 2018, ENISA confirmed that CSIRTs, LEAs and the judiciary have complementary roles and that incident handling varies across Member States. The data CSIRTs and LEAs have access to varies, and it affects information sharing between them when they seek to respond to cybercrime. While CSIRTs interact frequently with LEAs rather than with public prosecutors, CSIRTs when collecting and analysing different types of evidence, they are called upon rarely as witness in court, even though material they collect during the incident handling typically supports an investigation and prosecution of a crime. The data supporting this roadmap was collected via desk research, interviews with subject-matter experts and an online survey. The data collected has demonstrated that CSIRTs, LEAs and the Judiciary come across a range of challenges that are likely to impact their ability to cooperate effectively. The legal framework has been quoted as an impeding factor when seeking to exchange data. Discrepancies in the levels of technical or legal knowledge is another one, as it may make communication challenging. The chain of custody in evidence collection might also be an issue when using methods that might make evidence likely inadmissible in Court. Incident notifications and cybercrime reporting differ across Member States as different legal obligations might have been laid out by national law. Recommendations: Core areas of further analysis and ENISA recommendations in an effort to improve cooperation between CSIRTs, LEAs and their interaction with the judiciary include: Promoting the use of ‘Segregation of duties’ matrix for avoiding conflicting roles and responsibilities of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary throughout the cybercrime investigation lifecycle. Developing a competency framework for cybersecurity workforce and education and training policies. Promoting knowledge of digital forensics rules. Promoting interoperability of cooperation tools deployed and conceived considering future technologies. Assessing the suitability of cybersecurity certification for common tools and procedures. Simplifying arrangements by creating internal cooperation procedures to streamline exchanges. The target audience of this roadmap includes mainly, but it is not limited to CSIRTs, LEAs, prosecutors, and judges. This roadmap builds on past ENISA work and it contributes to the implementation of the ENISA programming document 2019-2021, Output O.4.2.2   Further Information: ENISA Roadmap on the cooperation between CSIRTS and LE ENISA website section on CSIRTs and communities cooperation For more information on these reports, please contact: CSIRT-LE-cooperation@enisa.europa.eu For interviews, please contact press@enisa.europa.eu   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0142	2020-03-31	PR	Tips for cybersecurity when buying and selling online	 Tips for cybersecurity when buying and selling online  The Covid-19 outbreak has led to an increase of ecommerce as people look online to shop for anything from books to groceries. A positive side to this is the growth in digital transformation particularly of small businesses, who need to have an online presence to survive.  SMEs make up 99% of the European businesses and while 77% of SMEs have a website only 17% are selling online (Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) 2019). At the same time, 41% of Europeans are concerned about the security of online payments (Eurobarometer Europeans’ attitudes towards cyber security – January 2020). As SMEs set up online business because their survival depends on it. Citizens buy online because they want to protect their safety. Both the SME and the consumer are looking to fulfil their needs quickly. They often don’t want to implement lengthy cybersecurity solutions and in order to assist, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity has developed 10 tips for SMEs and citizens to stay secure when buying and selling online.   For citizens: Cyber secure buying online Secure connection: Pay attention to the security seal of each website that you are browsing by looking for the presence of the little green padlock in the address bar. This means in general that your connection is established over a secure channel.   Look out for Covid-19 phishing emails and fake websites: there has been an increase in the registration of domains, which contain the word ‘Corona’, which is used by cyber criminals to offer scams. Be suspicious of any e-mails asking to check or renew your credentials even if it seems to come from a trusted source. In all cases, try to verify the authenticity of the request through other means, do not click on suspicious links or open any suspicious attachments. Watch out for emails purporting to be an invoice for a purchase that was in fact not made. Payment fraud: Check your online accounts and your bank statements regularly and report any suspicious activity to your bank. If you think you have been a victim of an attack, contact your bank. If possible, activate two-factor authentication for payments. Updated systems - make sure your system (operating system and the applications used) is up to date as well as ensuring your antivirus and antimalware are installed and fully updated. Protect your privacy - Think twice when asked for data and read privacy policies. If you need to set up an account with a supplier, use strong passwords that cannot easily be predicted and use a password manager. Avoid sharing personal information with persons you do not know on social media. Consider using privacy tools, such as anti-tracking and secure messaging tools, for your online and mobile protection.   For SMEs: Cyber secure online selling Secure your website for customers: It’s vital you have the right security to protect both your enterprise but also your customers, for example use https connections and enable 2 factor authentication where possible. Additionally it’s important to test the security of the website and ensure adequate support for customers in case of problems. Protect your assets: Much like any other business asset, information needs to be strategically managed and protected. Information security is the protection of information within a business, including the systems and hardware used to store, process and transmit this information. Make sure a security policy is in place, together with all necessary technical and organisation security measures. Store passwords securely: If customers need to create accounts to buy from your website, then make sure all passwords are stored securely. Make sure your client data is protected according to the rules of the industry. Where possible, make sure sensitive data is not readable, solutions such as keyed or salted hashes could be applied. Ensure compliance with data protection requirements: When processing personal data of customers, make sure that you comply with the legal framework on data protection. Visit your national Data Protection Authority’s website for further information. Monitor and prevent incidents – Have a security incident response policy in place and make sure that measures are taken for the prevention, monitoring and response to security incidents, including personal data breaches.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0144	2020-03-26	PR	Launch of our cybersecurity platform: get involved and educate yourself	 Cybersecurity Skills Development in the EU The new  whitepaper on “Cybersecurity Skills Development in the EU” focuses on the state of the cybersecurity education system and the difficulty in attracting more students to cybersecurity studies. It looks at how we can increase the number of graduates with relevant cybersecurity knowledge and skills. This report provides considerations and recommendations for policy actions at national and at European level in order to address the shortage in cybersecurity skills. In addition, further areas of research are being considered to identify the nature and extent of the EU cybersecurity skills shortage. The paper addresses: The policy challenge of the cybersecurity skills shortage; The causes of the shortage; explaining why many stakeholders agree on the need to set standards for cybersecurity certification degrees; The processes and criteria established by 4 countries in order to certify cybersecurity degrees and the implications of establishing certification for cybersecurity degrees; The creation of the ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database; Recommendations for increasing the number of graduates with the right cybersecurity knowledge and skills.  The Cybersecurity Higher Education Database All the EU higher education institutions with cybersecurity degrees are invited to add their degrees to the Cybersecurity Higher Education Database. This will allow young talents to make informed decisions in light of the different possibilities offered by higher education in cybersecurity. It will also help universities to attract highly motivated students interested in keeping Europe cyber secure. By creating a single and easy-to-use online platform where citizens can find relevant information on cybersecurity degrees, the Agency seeks to fill potential information gaps. Such gaps are obvious, for example, when students might be interested in a cybersecurity career but don’t know where to find information on the best educational pathways available. The database therefore intends to bridge the gap between cybersecurity supply and demand. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity, Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar, stated: “Having enough professionals to secure information systems has become an absolute priority. The database and skills development white paper are two tools the Agency created to support cybersecurity awareness and education which are needed to build Europe’s cyber capacities”   Background of the EU Cybersecurity Education Policy Cybersecurity education and skills have attracted policy interest since the publication by the European Commission of the first EU cybersecurity strategy in 2013. The Commission invited Member States to increase their education and training efforts around network and information security (NIS) topics. The intention was to create a ‘NIS driving licence’ as a voluntary certification programme to promote advanced skills and validate the competences of IT professionals. In 2017, in the Joint Communication ‘Resilience, deterrence and defence: Building strong cybersecurity for the EU’ , the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy confirmed again that ‘there is a strong education dimension to cybersecurity’. They declared also that ‘effective cybersecurity relies heavily on the skills of the people concerned’. The Agency has been an active player in cybersecurity education, awareness and research. Since 2012, seven publications were produced of high relevance to the topic. In addition, the agency has been running the European Cyber Security Challenge and the European Cyber Security Month, an awareness campaign taking place every October.   Further Information: Cybersecurity Higher Education Database ENISA Report - Cybersecurity Skills Development in the EU For interviews and press questions press@enisa.europa.eu   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0145	2020-03-24	PR	Tips for cybersecurity when working from home	 One of the key preventive measures for the spread of Covid-19 is social distancing. Luckily, in this increasingly connected world we can continue our professional and private lives virtually.  However, with huge increases in the number of people working remotely, it is of vital importance that we also take care of our cyber hygiene. 1- Recommendations for employers and staff The following recommendations for maintaining an adequate level of cybersecurity when teleworking are divided into those for employers and for staff on teleworking. Recommendations for employers Ensure that the corporate VPN solution scales and is able to sustain a large number of simultaneous connections. Provide secure video conferencing for corporate clients (both audio/video capabilities). All the corporate business applications must be accessible only via encrypted communication channels (SSL VPN, IPSec VPN). Access to application portals should be safeguarded using multifactor authentication mechanisms. Prevent the direct Internet exposure of remote system access interfaces (e.g. RDP). Mutual authentication is preferred when accessing corporate systems (e.g. client to server and server to client). Provide where possible corporate computers/devices to staff while on teleworking; ensure that these computers/devices have up-to-date security software and security patch levels and that users are regularly reminded to check patch levels. It is advisable that a replacement scheme for failing devices is also in place. BYOD (Bring your own device) such as personal laptops or mobile devices must be vetted from the security standpoint using NAC, NAP platforms. (e.g. patch check, configuration check , AV check etc.). Ensure that adequate IT resources are in place to support staff in case of technical issues while teleworking; provide relevant information, e.g. on contact points, to staff. Ensure policies for responding to security incidents and personal data breaches are in place and that staff is appropriately informed of them. Ensure that any processing of staff data by the employer in the context of teleworking (e.g. time keeping) is in compliance with the EU legal framework on data protection.  Recommendations for staff on teleworking Use corporate (rather than personal) computers where possible - unless BYOD has been vetted as per relevant point under Section 1 above. As far as possible, do not mix work and leisure activities on the same device and be particularly careful with any mails referencing the corona virus. Connect to the internet via secure networks; avoid open/free networks. Most wifi systems at home these days are correctly secured, but some older installations might not be. With an insecure connection, people in the near vicinity can snoop your traffic (more technical people might be able to hijack the connection). That having been said, the risk is not that much higher than when using public 'open networks' except for the fact that presumably people will be in the same place for a long time. The solution is to activate the encryption if it hasn't been done already and/or to adopt a recent implementation. Note that this risk is somewhat mitigated by using a secure connection to the office. Avoid the exchange of sensitive corporate information (e.g. via email) through possibly insecure connections. As far as possible use corporate Intranet resources to share working files. On the one hand, this ensures that working files are up-to-date and at the same time, sharing of sensitive information across local devices is avoided. Be particularly careful with any emails referencing the corona virus, as these may be phishing attempts or scams (see below). In case of doubt regarding the legitimacy of an email, contact the institution’s security officer. Data at rest, e.g. local drives, should be encrypted (this will protect against theft / loss of the device). Antivirus / Antimalware must be installed and be fully updated. The system (operating system and applications used, as well as anti-virus system) needs to be up to date. Lock your screen if you work in a shared space (you should really avoid co-working or shared spaces at this moment. Remember, social distancing is extremely important to slow down the spread of the virus). Do not share the virtual meeting URLs on social media or other public channels. (Unauthorized 3rd parties could access private meetings in this way. 2-    Phishing scams linked to COVID-19 It is important to step up awareness of digital security during this time as we have already seen an increase in phishing attacks. Attackers are exploiting the situation, so look out for phishing emails and scams.  In the current situation, one should be suspicious of any emails asking to check or renew your credentials even if it seems to come from a trusted source. Please try to verify the authenticity of the request through other means, do not click on suspicious links or open any suspicious attachments. Be very suspicious of mails from people you don't know- especially if they ask to connect to links or open files (if in doubt phone your security officer). Mails that create an image of urgency or severe consequences are key candidates for phishing - in these cases always verify via an external channel before complying. Mails sent from people you know, but asking for unusual things are also suspect - verify by phone if possible.

ENISA_NEWS_0147	2020-03-23	NEWS	Cyber Europe 2020 postponed	 Cyber Europe: preparing healthcare sector to respond to cyber crisis is the 6th Pan European exercise that the EU Agency for Cybersecurity had planned for June 2020.   The Cyber Europe 2020 planners developed a scenario revolving around healthcare, which can include, Ministries of Health, hospitals, clinics, labs and eHealth service providers with potential impacts in other sectors. After request from the national planners (the national authorities in charge of coordinating Cyber Europe for each Member State) Cyber Europe 2020 will be postponed Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the healthcare sector is currently going through a major crisis that will test its resilience and therefore a simulated cyber crisis like Cyber Europe is currently not a priority. For this reason the Agency together with the national planners unanimously decided to postpone the exercise for early 2021. The situation will be further assessed in the next six months. About Cyber Europe Cyber Europe is a series of pan-European exercises aimed at testing cybersecurity, business continuity and crisis management capabilities. The exercise is organised by the Agency since 2010. The Cyber Europe exercises are simulations of large-scale cybersecurity incidents that escalate to become cyber crisis. The exercises take place once every two years. The scenario contains real life inspired technical incidents to analyse, from forensic and malware analysis, open source intelligence, and of course non-technical incidents.

Luckily, in this increasingly connected world we can continue our professional and private lives virtually.  However, with huge increases in the number of people working remotely, it is vital that we also take care of our cyber hygiene. Awareness and preparedness are both vital - use the CERT-EU News Monitor to stay updated on the latest threats and check the following basics: Secure wifi connection. Most wifi systems at home these days are correctly secured, but some older installations might not be. With an insecure connection, people in the near vicinity can snoop your traffic. Fully updated anti-virus system in place. Up to date security software. Security tools such as privacy tools, add-ons for browsers etc need to be up to date. Patch levels should be regularly checked. Remember to back up periodically. All important files should be backed up regularly. In a worst case scenario, staff could fall foul of ransomware for instance. Then all is lost without a backup. Lock your screen if you work in a shared space. (you should really avoid co-working or shared spaces at this moment. Remember, social distancing is extremely important to slow down the spread of the virus). Make sure you are using a secure connection to your work environment. Check if you have encryption tools installed.   Things employers can do: Provide initial and then regular feedback to staff on how to react in case of problems. Who to call, hours of service, emergency procedures and how they evolve. Give suitable priority to the support of remote access solutions. Employers should provide at least authentication and secure session capabilities (essentially encryption). Provide virtual solutions. At the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, we use electronic signatures and virtual approval workflows to ensure continuous functionality. Ensure adequate support in case of problems. This may require setting up special rotas for staff. Define a clear procedure to follow in case of a security incident. Consider restricting access to sensitive systems where it makes sense. Covid-19 Phishing Attacks It is important to step up awareness of digital security during this time as we have already seen an increase in phishing attacks.

ENISA_NEWS_0151	2020-03-06	NEWS	After cloud…cybersecurity certification: launching the ENISA ad hoc Working Group on Cloud Services	 Under the EU Cybersecurity Act, an ad hoc working group provides advice to the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) vis-à-vis a draft candidate cybersecurity certification scheme and it culminates open consultation with relevant stakeholders. Over the past few years, cloud services have become the backbone of information and telecommunications services in the Digital Single Market as consumers as well as private and public services alike seek to reap the benefits of ubiquitous services in relation to increased productivity at a lower cost. In response, several Member States including but not limited to France, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands have set up assessment and/or certification frameworks concerning these services. These frameworks have complemented private certification schemes widely available throughout the market.   Acting on a prominent Commission initiative, dubbed CSP-CERT, representatives of both the private and the public sectors have already reached consensus and put forward a proposal for a certification scheme for the cloud; however, several aspects have yet to be sorted out. The Commission request to ENISA concerning a cybersecurity certification scheme for Cloud services has been grounded on the Regulation for the free flow of non-personal data. Other relevant aspects concerning the cybersecurity of non-personal as well as personal data flows are likely to also come under the scope. This ad hoc working group is composed of 20 selected members broadly representing stakeholders’ communities across providers and users, small and large companies, public sector etc. The work of this group has also attracted the interest of around 15 representatives from Member States public authorities as well as EU Institutions and bodies that have designated representatives; the output draft candidate cybersecurity certification is expected to be finalised in late 2020.   Further Information ENISA's work on cloud servicies ENISA's work on certification schemes Call for expression of interest for an ad hoc Working Group on cybersecurity certification for cloud services For questions and interviews: press@enisa.europa.eu   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0152	2020-02-24	PR	Prevention is the cyberdefence for hospitals	 The hospital is a vast ecosystem comprised of an entire network of devices, equipment and systems that often require connection to external systems, making monitoring and control a very hard task to do. This is due to the high sensitivity of medical data and the potential vulnerability the sector is faced with (see: Two thirds of healthcare organisations suffered cybersecurity incident in 2019), cybersecurity has to be applied every step of the way to ensure patient data privacy and the availability and resilience of healthcare services at the same time. A cybersecurity procurement guide for Hospitals The ‘Procurement Guidelines for Cybersecurity in Hospitals’ published by the Agency is designed to support the healthcare sector in taking informative decisions on cybersecurity when purchasing new hospital assets. It provides the information to be included in the procurement requests that hospitals publish in order to obtain IT equipment.   This new report outlines good practices and recommendations for including cybersecurity as a provision in the procurement process in hospitals. Initially the report presents the set of hospital assets and the most prominent cybersecurity threats linked to them. After categorising the procurement process in three steps, namely ‘Plan, Source and Manage’, it identifies the cybersecurity requirements associated with each step. To make this even easier, the guide provides suggestions for evidence on how the requirements can be fulfilled by the provider. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity, Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar, stated: “Protecting patients and ensuring the resilience of our hospitals are a key part of the Agency’s work to make Europe’s health sector cyber secure” Who can use the Guide? This guide provides an accessible overview and allows reutilisation by CIOs and CISOs of healthcare providers, medical device manufacturers, insurers and other healthcare related organisations, with the objective of becoming a useful reference. The visualisation of this information into a handy tool will be released in the coming months. The Agency is supporting the healthcare sector to raise cybersecurity capacity and awareness since 2015; issuing several good practice guides, organising dedicated cybersecurity conferences and supporting policy implementation i.e. NIS Directive, Medical Device Regulation, (see: New Medical Device Coordination Group Guidance on Cybersecurity for Medical Devices). Additionally, later this year the Agency will organise a pan-European exercise, Cyber Europe 2020 with a focus on the healthcare sector.

ENISA_NEWS_0153	2020-02-19	NEWS	Building a Stronger Cybersecurity Community: 8th ENISA Industry Event	 With the new European Parliament and Commission, and following the conclusion of the legislative process for the new EU Cybersecurity Act, 2020 will be a year that marks important milestones for the EU and the EU Agency for Cybersecurity in particular. Within this context however, the primary objective of the ENISA Industry Event 2020 remains unchanged. Through this mechanism, the Agency will continue to inform small and medium sized businesses on recent cybersecurity policy and industrial policy developments and to help them to adapt to and to make the most of opportunities offered by these developments. By so doing, ENISA aims to support this stakeholder group by improving the level of cybersecurity throughout the EU,  and to encourage collaboration in the development of a more competitive cybersecurity market in parallel. Steve Purser, Head of Core Operations at ENISA, opened the forum with an explanation of how the role of the Agency has evolved with the coming into force of the Cybersecurity Act (CSA). Particular attention was given to the EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework and the ‘Blueprint’ (cyber crisis coordination and pan-European incident handling). He also used the example of the recent work done at EU level to secure 5G implementations and suggested that this approach might be considered as a template for how the Agency deals with other future technology challenges, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). The conference focused on the latest policy developments and how these affect the European Industry landscape. In the morning session, industry members of the Commission's High Level expert group on Artificial Intelligence (AI), experts from ENISA, the Joint Research Center and Fraunhofer Institute spoke gave an overview of the current situation of cybersecurity for AI. The afternoon session was kicked off by Commission officials presenting the priorities of the new Commission, the cyber-security package, Horizon 2020 funding and cyber-theft of trade secrets. ENISA also shared recent developments since the adoption of the Cybersecurity Act including a briefing on the state of affairs in cyber-security certification.

Other ENISA events back-to-back To reduce the amount of air travel for these groups, ENISA organised other meetings back-to-back. Earlier in the week, the Agency hosted the 3rd meeting of national authorities for the security of digital infrastructures under the NIS Directive (TLD, IXP, DNS). At the end of the week, the Agency organised a 5G security seminar for the telecom security authorities to build up technical knowledge on 5G, mobile networks, interconnections and signalling. Related Telecom Security Work The new telecom rules will come into force at the end of 2020. The Agency recently published a paper listing the changes in telecom Security Supervision under the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC). For the interested reader, the statistical data about telecom security 2018 incidents are available in the Telecom security incident reporting - Visual Tool, which allows custom data aggregations and analysis. In the coming months ENISA will publish the ‘Annual Telecom Security Incident’ report, which aggregates and analyses the major incidents which were reported across Europe in 2019. The previous Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2018 showed interesting trends, regarding the size of system failures (decreasing) and the overall impact of natural phenomena (increasing, and for the first time the biggest share). Background Over the last 10 years, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity has worked closely with European telecom security authorities to implement Article 13a of the Framework directive, i.e. regarding incident reporting and security requirements for telecom operators. The Article 13a group meets 3 times per year. Once per year we organise a telecom security meeting for a broader audience. The Article 13a Expert Group was set up 10 years ago by the Agency, under the auspices of the European Commission, to agree on a harmonised implementation of Article 13a of the Telecom Framework Directive, which requires EU countries to supervise the security of telecom networks and services in the EU. Further Information Details on the Article 13a Group are available on the Resilience portal - Article 13a  If you like to know more, or if you want to join our mailing lists to be kept up to date about our telecom security work or to receive invitations for future telecom security meetings, please contact us via resilience@enisa.europa.eu For queries or interviews, please contact press@enisa.europe.eu   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0160	2020-02-10	PR	Do you know who is who in EU cybersecurity?	 A complex landscape of actors in EU cybersecurity The ENISA - EU Cybersecurity Institutional Map is an attempt to depict the complex landscape of actors involved in cybersecurity at the EU level. This map aims to provide a clear picture of the responsibilities and roles of the different EU institutions, agencies and bodies in cybersecurity. This online tool is the output of the joint efforts between the Agency and the Austrian Presidency of the EU Council to provide a meaningful mapping of the cybersecurity roles and responsibilities and functions of all actors involved to both cybersecurity policy makers and the general public alike. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity, Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar, stated: “It is the task of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity to make sense of this landscape because the context changes continuously. The mapping of how the roles and responsibilities of EU institutions and groups have developed will allow us to regularly identify gaps, overlaps and improvements.” What the map IS and IS NOT The EU Cybersecurity Institutional Map IS: A depiction of the roles, responsibilities and tasks of EU Institutions and EU groups. A living tool that will be subject to a continuous content update process. Based on publicly available information and input provided by EU Institutions, Agencies and Bodies. The EU Cybersecurity Institutional Map IS NOT: A map of Member State-level actors. An analysis of actors with sectorial scope; the analysis for now is limited to actors with a horizontal role spanning across all sectors. A detailed and all-inclusive description of roles and responsibilities. How can I use the tool? The EU Cybersecurity Institutional Map is an easy-to-use online tool that allows the user to get an overview of the EU cybersecurity landscape and drill-down to more specific information about the respective roles and responsibilities of each. The user can navigate any of the three available dimensions: Actors - EU Institutions, Agencies and Bodies with a role in cybersecurity at EU level. Communities - groups of actors with a role in Cyber Resilience, Justice in Cyberspace and Cybercrime, Cyber Defence and Cyber Diplomacy. Functions - specific activities or strategic objectives where actors can have a role Next steps The Agency will maintain this map on its website and periodically update the content in collaboration with other EU Institutions, Agencies and Bodies to ensure that the map is an accurate depiction of the constantly evolving landscape.

ENISA_PR_0161	2020-02-04	PR	Standardisation and the EU Cybersecurity Act	 The EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework will make it easier for ICT manufacturers and developers to serve the EU market. A unified Cybersecurity Certification Framework across the EU will reduce the effects that a fragmented market has on the economy. To support the creation of certification schemes under this framework the role of standardisation bodies is key. EU Standardisation Conference On the 3rd of February 2020, the Agency organised a conference ‘Cybersecurity Standardisation and the EU Cybersecurity Act - What's Up?’ together with the European Standards Developing Organisations – CEN-CENELEC and ETSI. The event attracted over 400 stakeholders from various sectors – policy makers, industry, research, standardisation organisations, certification organisations and those involved in the development of the ICT certification framework in Europe. The conference discussed the challenges in the standardisation landscape for cybersecurity in light of the EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA). The main topics were: The role of standardisation to support the certification framework Achievements in cybersecurity standardisation and the rolling plan of standardisation bodies First EU certification scheme – difficulties and success stories in relation to standards Next prospective schemes – way ahead The Executive Director of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, Juhan Lepassaar, commented “It is important that organisations involved in standardisation and certification align their activities. The EU cybersecurity certification framework must be supported by modern, high quality standards.” As a follow up of this event, we publish today two studies related to the domain of standards supporting the Cybersecurity Act and the new certification framework. Recommendations for European standardisation in relation to the Cybersecurity Act The Report - Standardisation in support of the Cybersecurity Certification presents the value of the cybersecurity standardisation efforts for certification, the roles and responsibilities of Standards Developing Organisations (SDOs) in this context, and discusses various ways how standardisation can support efficiently the process of creating certification schemes by following a step by step methodology. The methodology described in this study can be used as guidelines for new certification schemes or standards authors. It will help in setting up KPIs, useful for all stakeholders involved in the preparation or operational phase of a certification scheme. The qualification system proposed can also be used to define more precisely the requirements associated with the different assurance levels mentioned in article 52 of the Cybersecurity Act. With regard to standardisation activities, the study proposes a set of recommendations for the Standards Developing Organisations and the prospective authors of certification schemes. Analysis of standards in areas relevant to the potential EU candidate cybersecurity certification schemes The Report - Standards Supporting Certification explores five distinct areas, in which frameworks, schemes or standards currently exist that could potentially be evolved to EU candidate cybersecurity certification schemes. These five areas are the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud infrastructure and services, threat intelligence in the financial sector, electronic health records in the healthcare and qualified trust services. The study reflects on the standards currently available in these five areas of interest and identifies existing gaps. It further proposes recommendations on how these gaps can be addressed, especially by standardisation bodies, and how the available standards could potentially be adapted to form the basis of future candidate EU cybersecurity certification schemes.   Further Information: Cybersecurity Standardisation and the EU Cybersecurity Act - What's Up? event page ENISA Report - Standardisation in support of the Cybersecurity Certification ENISA Report - Standards Supporting Certification   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0162	2020-02-03	NEWS	Cyber Threat Intelligence Community Bonding event 	 20 speakers participating in the various CTI sessions and a wide audience of 160 participants made this a successful event. Approximately 9 vendors of CTI products have participated in the CTI showroom, networking with the event participants. During the presentations and interactions with participants, it was stressed that CTI is about information collection, contextualisation, analysis and creation of bodies of knowledge. Processes guiding these activities need to undergo a continuous maturity process. In the EU, historically, some organisation units have started developing these capabilities due to their emerging role and needs. ENISA, CERT EU, DG CONNECT, EEAS, JRC, EDA are such cases, all present in the panel CTI in European Commission services, opened by the EU Agency for Cybersecurity Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar. Their engagement spans most of the CTI areas: operational/tactical (CERT EU), tactical/strategic (ENISA), strategic/policy (Commission) geopolitical (EEAS), defence (Commission, EDA), scientific/hybrid threats capability (JRC). In the meantime, these activities became mainstream in the daily businesses of these organisations. The objective of the conference was to learn from available knowledge and analysis skills, facilitate exchange of best practices, find synergies with the aim to make approaches coherent. We can together find paths to mutually achieve a higher level of CTI maturity. Initial steps with CERT EU and JRC on the matter have been already agreed, a short time ago. This is imperative in order to facilitate decision-making and risk management activities at all levels: technical, operational, scientific, policy and diplomacy. This is a vital contribution increasing European autonomy in the critical area of CTI and at the same time towards strategic objective of a unified European approach in cybersecurity. The Network Information Security conference organised by ENISA and FORTH Hellas Institute, will take place again on the last quarter of the year. Information on this event will be become available soon.   Further Information: Event page - 2020 CTI-EU | Bonding EU Cyber Threat Intelligence   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0163	2020-01-30	NEWS	The EU Agency for Cybersecurity endorses the EU Toolbox for 5G Security	 Last year, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity also supported the EU Member States with developing an EU-wide joint risk assessment regarding the 5G roll out, and delivered a 5G threat landscape report, which analyses threats at a more technical level. All three items, i.e. the joint risk assessment, the threat landscape and the toolbox are implementing what was requested by the European Commission in the recommendation on 5G cybersecurity of March of last year. The EU Toolbox for 5G Security published yesterday was developed by the NIS Cooperation group. This group has representatives from all EU Member States and it was set up under the NIS Directive, for the purpose of strategic EU-wide collaboration on cybersecurity issues. The NIS Cooperation group is currently chaired by Croatia under the Presidency of the EU Council. 5G cybersecurity is one of several work streams of activities inside the NIS Cooperation group. ENISA supports the group in all the different activities, helping member states with the drafting of guidelines, reference documents with good practices, developing collaboration procedures, exercises, etc. Yesterday, for example, the NIS Cooperation group launched a new work stream on cybersecurity in the health care sector. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity is looking forward to supporting the European Commission and the EU Member States with the next steps, i.e. the implementation of the toolbox.   Further information: EU Toolbox for 5G Security European Commission's factsheet about the EU Toolbox for 5G Security European Commission's press release endorsing the EU Toolbox for 5G Security European Commission's communication on implementing the EU Toolbox for 5G Security NIS Cooperation group  ENISA - threat landscape for 5G Networks European Commission's recommendation on 5G cybersecurity   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0164	2020-01-29	PR	Good practices under the National Cyber Security Strategies 	 Innovation in cybersecurity is a key enabler to facilitate progress in the NIS industry, boost employment in the cybersecurity sector and growth of EU GDP. Today, ENISA publishes the Good Practices in Innovation under NCSS Report that analyses the current landscape for supporting innovation in cybersecurity in the EU. ENISA’s study presents good practices and challenges from the Member States whilst trying to execute innovation as a strategic priority of their National Cyber Security Strategies (NCCS). The report focuses on: Understanding the current landscape and mechanisms for supporting innovation in cybersecurity in the EU; Understanding the financial supporting mechanism in each Member State from the public sector (R&D funds) and how research results can end up as products on the market; Sharing good practices; Proposing recommendations to relevant stakeholders to foster the growth of innovation in cybersecurity in the EU. The analysis of the report is structured around several aspects of innovation such as: Innovation Priorities, Industrialisation and Collaboration and Market and Policy. The study identifies a set of challenges and good practices, as stakeholders perceive them, across the different innovation aspects. The identification of these challenges may help in recognising relevant actions for addressing them and also in drafting future innovation strategic objectives. Juhan Lepassaar, Executive Director of ENISA: “The CSA, the NIS Directive and the GDPR incentivised innovation in relevant areas of cybersecurity and data protection. To encounter current and emerging cybersecurity risks and threats, EU Member States need to strengthen and adjust their national capabilities by developing innovative solutions and objectives under their NCSS.'' Key findings and recommendations The main key findings and recommendation of the study include: Member States follow different approaches to support innovation in the context of National Cyber Security Strategies. In some cases, Member States promote the creation of new skills and capabilities around digital competences such as InCoDe2030 programme in Portugal. In other cases, they create networks of stakeholders giving them a mandate on innovation. These networks are either government driven, such as INCIBE, the National Cybersecurity Agency in Spain or industry driven, such as Cyber Ireland. Innovation activities are also driven by national institutions and research centres such as NASK Poland. There is difficulty for governments to understand the needs of the industry, as well as to develop expertise in dealing with Public Private Partnerships. To align with industry needs and identify opportunities for adopting or commercialising research outcomes, Member States need to involve industry directly in research and innovation activities. ENISA has developed a study on “Effective Collaborative Models on PPPs” with guidelines and recommendations for the development of PPPs in Europe. Dedicated funding mechanisms and initiatives often focus on varied research and innovative objectives rather than being specific on cybersecurity.  Supporting and developing sector specific innovation priorities is important for coordinating alternative funding mechanisms and develop a sectorial approach to innovation in cybersecurity. It is necessary to take into account different cybersecurity needs across sectors and develop sector specific innovation priorities both at National and EU level. A good example is CyberSecIdent in Poland the aims at increasing the security of cyberspace of the Republic of Poland. Lengthy procurement processes prevent SMEs and innovative companies such as start-ups to offer their services to the public sectors. Supporting adequate level of funding and providing economic incentives such as tax incentives may accelerate the adoption of new technologies, products and services. The Swedish Innovation Agency allocates a large amount of funds for innovation in cybersecurity. Geographical clusters are important mechanisms that support innovation. There are several initiative that bring people together, such as the Brussels initiative on Cybersecurity Innovation. Promoting EU level certification of services/products would enhance trust for users within the EU and provide a stamp of approval for international markets.   ENISA’s work on NCSS: ENISA has developed the NCSS Interactive map to note the progress of Member States in implementing their national cybersecurity strategies. The interactive map is an info hub with information provided by the MS. ENISA is working on the topic of National Cyber Security Strategies since 2012 and support the efforts of Member States MS by: Analysing existing strategies to outline good practices. Developing guidelines on the NCSS development, implementation and evaluation phase. Performing deep dives on specific strategic objectives such as effective cooperative models on PPPs and ISACs.

ENISA_PR_0165	2020-01-27	PR	Securing Personal Data:  a risk-based approach	 Security and Data Protection: Two Sides of the Same Coin To mark Data Protection Day 2020 on 28 January, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity launches an online platform to assist in the security of personal data processing; this platform implements a risk-based approach to personal data security as a means to underpin trust. New Platform The new platform is part of the work of the Agency in privacy and data protection, which focuses on analysing technical solutions for the implementation of GDPR, privacy by design and security of personal data processing. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity, Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar, stated: “It is the role of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity to support the cybersecurity ecosystem with practical advice and tools to support risk mitigation. The platform is a key tool providing guidance to organisations on their risk profile when processing personal data; furthermore, this platform provides organisations with recommendations based on their individual profile.” Main recommendations The spectrum of recommendations in the accompanying report refers to the following areas: Organisations, such as SMEs, that process personal data (data controllers) and competent EU bodies should work towards common use cases and examples for personal data security, while supporting broader security risk assessment frameworks that embed data protection requirements. Competent EU bodies and Data Protection Authorities should develop practical guidance documents that will be able to support and assist different types of data controllers on the selection of appropriate and adequate security measures. The research community and standardisation bodies should continue working on giving technical solutions to ever increasing security threats in different areas  of security measures and privacy enhancing technologies, with the support of competent EU bodies and the European Commission, in terms of policy guidance and funding. The European Commission, Data Protection Authorities and Competent EU bodies should explore the possible synergies between different certification frameworks as regards the security of personal data processing. Who can use the platform? Data controllers and their assisting contractors (data processors) can benefit from this platform to determine their approach when seeking to develop policies to protect personal data under their control. This platform can also be proven useful to auditors and supervising authorities alike, in an effort to determine the level of preparation and analysis preceding the designation of security measures adopted by a data controller.  There is scope to leverage on this platform among the SME community, which can benefit from publicly available solutions, as the one provided by ENISA, to support GDPR compliance. Background As security of personal data processing is a key obligation for data controllers and processors under the General Data Protection Regulation Article 32, ENISA has proposed in 2018 a risk-based approach for the adoption of security measures for the protection of personal data.

ENISA_PR_0166	2020-01-27	PR	Security supervision changes in the new EU telecoms legislation	 Telecom security supervision In the EU providers of electronic communications fall under security rules and security supervision by national authorities in the EU Member States. The report published today, called “Security supervision under the EECC” is a first step to support EU Member States in their implementation of the new rules called the European Electronic Communication Code. The report highlights the main changes and identifies the key areas where future work is needed, by the national authorities and ENISA, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity. Key changes in the legislation We see the 7 important changes for telecom security supervision: Over-The-Top (OTT) services, like WhatsApp and Gmail, for example, will be in scope of the EU telecom rules and will be supervised by national authorities. The new rules provide an EU-wide definition of security requirements and security incidents for the telecom sector. They clarify for example that breaches of confidentiality of communications, or issues with the authentication of users, for example, are in scope. Previously this was left up to interpretation. This meant there was no clear mandate for authorities to address them. The new rules require telecom providers to implement state-of-the-art measures, such as (end-to-end) encryption. This is important to protect the security and privacy of consumers in the EU. Telecom providers are also required to promote, with their customers, the use of encryption tools, and to inform their customers about possible threats, so they can protect themselves. Additionally, the national telecom authorities can ask telecom providers to mitigate specific cyber threats, even before there are actual incidents. The new rules clarify what parameters need to be considered in the telecom security breach reporting, to assess the significance of breaches, such as, among others, the impact on economic and societal activities Under the new rules the national telecom regulators will be able to collaborate with the other national authorities for cybersecurity, such as CSIRTs. This will improve situational awareness across the board and make supervision more effective and more consistent across different sectors. Juhan Lepassaar, the Executive Director of the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, said: “In 2020 the new European Electronic Communications Code will come into force. It aims to improve the security of electronic communications services. Anticipating this transition, to make the most out of the new rules, ENISA started collaborating with the national telecom regulators from across Europe. Our goal is to ensure that these new provisions will be rolled-out effectively and efficiently, with maximum benefit for the security and privacy of EU consumers, whether they call, chat, text, or email.” Target Audience This report provides recommendations for ministries and telecom regulators across Europe. It could be useful also for experts in the electronic communications sector (providers, industry associations). Timeline ENISA foresees the following areas of potential cooperation with the Members States in the following 2-3 years: Review and update of the existing security measures framework Development of national reporting thresholds and a new incident reporting guidelines Development of cross-border approaches to security supervision ENISA will work closely on these areas with the Article 13a Expert Group, a group of experts from the European Security Authorities. Background The new European Electronic Communication Code (EECC) adopted in December 2018 replaces the existing EU telecom regulatory framework and brings significant changes, among others, in the security supervision of the electronic communication services. The EECC requires Member States to implement the new rules by the end of 2020. The ENISA Article 13a expert group was set up in 2010, with the goal of bringing together experts from NRAs from across the EU to agree on a harmonised implementation of the security supervision requirements and incident reporting process according to the provisions of the Article 13a (of the Framework Directive 2009/140/EC). The result of this collaboration have been the guidelines on incident reporting, security measures and threats and assets. Moreover, ENISA annually publishes a report on Telecom Security Incidents.   Further information: Full report: Security supervision under the EECC.

ENISA_NEWS_0168	2020-01-15	NEWS	Open platform and tools to facilitate the collaboration among Computer Security Incident Response Teams	 Recently, the European Commission has selected a tender for funding under the call “Connecting Europe Facility – Cybersecurity Digital Service Infrastructure Maintenance and Evolution of Core Service Platform Cooperation Mechanism for CSIRTs – MeliCERTes Facility” (SMART 2018/1024). The winner is a strong consortium stemming from the CSIRTs community.  Poland’s national Computer Emergency Response Team (NASK/CERT.pl) will coordinate the work of the consortium supported by four partners, the Austrian Computer Emergency Response Team (nic.at/CERT.at), the Estonian Information System Authority (CERT.EE), the Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg (CIRCL) and Deloitte. They will work together to further develop and maintain the MeliCERTes platform offering sustainable services and collaboration tools to EU CSIRTs. Building on the services provided by the initial MeliCERTes platform and now hosted by the EU Cybersecurity Agency, ENISA, the new grant will cover: The implementation of a collection of open source tools used, developed and maintained by the CSIRTs themselves, with the primary goal of providing services for their own constituency. Improvement of the existing foundation as bootstrapped in MeliCERTes into long-term maintainable and a more operationalised platform, meant to support the cooperation efforts within the CSIRTs Network. Apart from maintenance and development of the key components of MeliCERTes, such as MISP and IntelMQ, fresh ideas for tooling will be incorporated during the project, for example vulnerability management and disclosure, large-scale malware storage or leak analysis and detection capabilities. A special emphasis will be put on ensuring that the needs and requirements of newer CSIRTs will be addressed. The consortium is composed of three members of the CSIRTs Network, which have a proven track record of both building new tooling and maintaining software over the long-term, such as CERT.at, CERT.PL, CIRCL and CERT EE. This 3 years grant receives a funding of 2 million EUR by the EU. It will be carried out in close collaboration with ENISA, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity is hosting the central node of the MeliCERTes facility. It builds on the outcomes of SMART 2015/1089 that developed the MeliCERTes core platform. Cybersecurity in Europe’s industrial sectors and operators of essential services Support to another important area comes from the CEF call ”Cybersecurity digital service infrastructure establishment of a core service platform cooperation mechanism for Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs) facilities manager” (SMART 2018/1022). The EU has procured 1.5 million EUR to a 3 years grant to assist the establishment and further development of European level sectorial ISACs covering all the sectors and subsectors identified by the NIS Directive (Annex II), such as in the energy, finance, healthcare, water distribution, digital infrastructure and transport sectors. In the selected grant Gapgemini (coordinator) and Intrasoft work together in a consortium supported by the Spark Legal Network, the Netherlands Organisation for applied scientific research (TNO) and the German DFN-CERT Services. The action will include the development of a strategy for the creation of new ISACs in critical sectors, support their start-up phase by providing technical and legal support and facilitate the launch of ISACs on a European level - also building on existing ISACs. The consortium will involve and closely work together with stakeholders from all relevant sectors. Also in this activity, ENISA will be a key partner in establishing European level sectorial ISACs. Today the kick-off meeting for both grants takes place in Brussels.

ENISA_NEWS_0169	2020-01-14	NEWS	The state of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities 2018-2019	 CERT-EU Working Visit ENISA´s Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar and Head of Core Operations, Steve Purser welcomed the Head of CERT-EU, Saâd Kadhi to its premises in Athens. CERT-EU plays an important role in effective and efficient response to information security incidents and the mitigation of cyber threats against the European Union institutions, bodies and agencies. The meeting included an overview of key ENISA and CERT-EU activities, including steps to enhance their bilateral cooperation as foreseen by the Cybersecurity Act with presentations on the CSIRTs Network, Cyber Threat Intelligence and the EU Blueprint for rapid emergency response in case of a large scale cross-border cyber incidents or crises. Information exchange and collaboration in joint projects are key priorities for CERT-EU and ENISA underpinned in the Memorandum of Understanding that was signed in May 2018 *. State of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities 2018-2019 Coinciding with the CERT-EU visit, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity published a report on the state of vulnerabilities 2018-2019. The report includes valuable contribution from CERT-EU experts as well as other renowned cybersecurity experts. Sharing information on vulnerabilities allows for informed decisions to made, remedies to be put in place and risks to be evaluated. The ‘State of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities’ report published today continues the work that was initially produced in 2016 when ENISA published the first of its kind report covering the topic of vulnerability disclosure. Since then, the vulnerability ecosystem has matured considerably. The positive developments are associated with increased efforts in collecting more accurate and consistent information about vulnerabilities, their severity, associated exploits/attacks as well as potential impact and complexity. Standardisation of Collected Information Standardisation plays a key role in the vulnerability information collection process by streamlining threat intelligence sharing and risk management. Generally, the information about vulnerabilities resides in either public or private/commercial databases, therefore it's not unreasonable to assume that there are differences among them, in terms of reliability, accuracy and completeness. Objectives The purpose of the report is to provide an insight on both the opportunities and limitations that the vulnerability ecosystem offers. By using the vulnerabilities published during the year of 2018 and Q1-Q2 of 2019 as a vehicle, this report attempts to go beyond the standard exploratory analysis, which is well captured by industry whitepapers and reports, and instead attempts to answer questions related to the reliability, accuracy of the vulnerability sources and the widely accepted evaluation metrics. The end goal of the report is to help the InfoSec community, public/private organisations and vendors to take informed decisions about patching, prioritisation of security controls and lastly to improve their risk assessment process. Target audience Information Security community (CSIRTs, Security Operations, other organisations with a stake in cybersecurity), Public and private organisations Research and Academia Vendors Background CERT-EU and the EU Agency for Cybersecurity have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in May 2018 together with Europol and EDA to establish a cooperation framework between their organisations. It focuses on five areas of cooperation, namely Exchange of information; Education & Training; Cyber exercises; Technical cooperation; and Strategic and Administrative matters.

ENISA_NEWS_0173	2019-12-03	NEWS	ENISA proposes Best Practices and Techniques for Pseudonymisation 	 In the light of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the challenge of proper application of pseudonymisation to personal data is gradually becoming a highly debated topic in many different communities, ranging from research and academia to justice and law enforcement and to compliance management in several organisations across Europe. The ENISA ‘Pseudonymisation techniques and best practices report’, amongst other, especially discusses the parameters that may influence the choice of pseudonymisation techniques in practice, such as data protection, utility, scalability and recovery. It also builds on specific use cases for the pseudonymisation of certain types of identifiers (IP address, email addresses, complex data sets). One of the main outcomes of the report is that there is no single easy solution to pseudonymisation that works for all approaches in all possible scenarios. On the contrary, it requires a high level of competence in order to apply a robust pseudonymisation process, possibly reducing the threat of discrimination or re-identification attacks, while maintaining the degree of utility necessary for the processing of pseudonymised data. On 12 November 2019, ENISA in co-operation with the Data Protection Authority of the German Federal State of Schleswig-Holstein (ULD) held a dedicated workshop on “Pseudonymisation and relevant security techniques” that aimed to further discuss and elaborate on the current state-of-the-art and existing experience on this field.   Further Information The ENISA Pseudonymisation techniques and best practices report The ENISA GDPR & deploying pseudonymisation techniques news   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0174	2019-12-02	NEWS	Cybersecurity certification: lifting the EU into the cloud	 In accordance with article 48(2) of the EU Cybersecurity Act, the European Commission has requested ENISA to prepare a cybersecurity certification candidate scheme for cloud services, taking into account existing and relevant schemes and standards. Cloud services provide important business opportunities for public administration and businesses. A single European cloud certification is critical for enabling the free flow of non-personal data, which allows for the unrestricted movement of data across borders and information systems within the EU. The cybersecurity certification of cloud services will bring enhanced trust and legal certainty in the security of cross-border data processing, as acknowledged by the Free Flow of Data Regulation.  Certified cloud services will reinforce the impact of this regulation helping the EU data economy to further contribute to GDP growth. The Commission has facilitated the work of the Cloud Service Provider Certification (CSPCERT) Working Group in this area. CSPCERT is a private and public stakeholder group, which has worked to provide a recommendation in relation to the security certification of cloud services to ENISA, the European Commission and the Member States, available here: CSPCERT WG - Recommendations for the implementation of the CSP Certification scheme. A call for expressions of interest for an Ad-Hoc Working Group for Cloud Cybersecurity Certification will be launched in due course and will be posted on the ENISA website.   Note to editors: Further information on Cybersecurity Certification can be found here: Bolstering ENISA in the EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework.   For further queries: Please contact press@enisa.europa.eu     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0176	2019-11-28	NEWS	ENISA launches a tool which maps security measures for OES to international standards	 The new tool is now available through an online platform dedicated to operators in the sectors of energy, transport, banking, financial market infrastructures, health, drinking water supply & distribution and digital infrastructures. Developed by ENISA, the tool is aimed at Operators of Essential Services, as well as public regulatory authorities of the Member States. The initiative stems from the NIS directive (EU) 2016/1148, which provides for the establishment of security measures for those operators offering essential services across the EU, in order to achieve a high common level of Security of Network and Information System.  The specific work stream of the NIS Directive Cooperation Group on security measures for OES enabled the analysis of security requirements in the EU against the most frequently used international information security standards across the defined sectors. The result of this analysis is visible in the tool as it compiles the existing security measures identified. The tool facilitates the search of security measures and their respective security controls in international standards. It also helps assessing their use in the Member States and in various NISD sectors. Operators can use this tool to map their own standards to the proposed security measures, enabling the assessment of their information security practices against the requirements adopted by the Cooperation Group. The Member States can use this tool to identify issues and look for solutions when assessing the security measures of their national OES and possibly identify a mapping to corresponding national security measures of other Member States.

ENISA_NEWS_0177	2019-11-27	NEWS	Knowledge-building on Cryptography for eIDAS Supervisory Bodies 	 In total 34 experts from 13 Member States attended the training, which is a part of the Agency’s support for the ENISA Article 19 Expert Group. The ENISA Article 19 group was set up by ENISA in 2015 to bring together experts from supervisory bodies who supervise Article 19 of the eIDAS, i.e. the security requirements for providers of electronic trust services in Europe. Day one – Cryptography foundations Day one of the knowledge building was dedicated to the foundations of cryptography and the cryptographic primitives. For this first day, ENISA had contracted the services of Professor Christian Rechberger, crypto researcher at TU Graz IAIK, and his colleague Daniel Kales. They went over cryptographic primitives and the foundations, and discussed new developments in the area of quantum-safe algorithms, as well as new cryptographic protocols such as homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof-systems. In the afternoon participants did some hands-on work and practical exercises to delve into multiparty computation, discussing threats and use-cases for the new cryptography.  Day two – Applied cryptography Day two of the knowledge building was dedicated to the application of cryptography in practice. For this second day ADACOM put together a programme with different teachers and subject matter experts from the University of the Aegean, QMSCERT, Ascertia, Gemalto amongst others. This second day covered themes including the IT infrastructure and architecture of a qualified Trust Service Provider (TSP), a roadmap for a TSP for complying with eIDAS, audits under eIDAS, from the perspective of the Conformity Assessment Body (CAB), and also more technical topics like remote Qualified Signature Creation Device solutions, remote ID Identification, secure remote on-boarding. In the afternoon participants did a hands-on exercise on two-factor biometric authentication architectures using smartphones and hardware security module One Time Passwords (OTPs). Further Information: This work has been carried out under Output O.1.2.3 ‘Support incident reporting activities in the EU’ of the 2019 Annual work programme of ENISA. In 2015, ENISA founded the Article 19 Expert Group, to bring together experts from supervisory bodies, to discuss on the technical details of incident reporting and the supervision of the security requirements in Article 19. Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation requires that trust service providers assess risks, take appropriate security measures, and notify significant security incidents and breaches of integrity to the national supervisory bodies. A representative from RTR Austria chairs the group, ENISA acts as its secretariat, and ENISA supports the group with logistics, collaboration tools, as well as breach reporting tooling and analysis.

ENISA_PR_0179	2019-11-27	PR	Incident Response in Europe, post-NIS Directive	 The NIS Directive and Incident Response The EU’s NIS Directive (Directive on security of network and information systems) was the first piece of EU-wide cybersecurity legislation. It aims to achieve a high common level of network and information system security across the EU’s critical infrastructure by bolstering capacities, cooperation and risk management practices across the Member States (MSs). The NISD covers the following sectors; energy, transport, banking, financial market infrastructures, the health sector, drinking water supply and distribution and digital infrastructure. The protection of an organisation's information by developing and implementing an incident response process (e.g. plans, defined roles, training, communications, management oversight) is vital in order to quickly discover an attack and effectively contain the damage, eradicate the attacker's presence, and restore the integrity of the network and systems Following the recent transposition of the Directive into Member States legislation, this study aims to analyse the current operational Incident Response (IR) set-up within NISD sectors and identify the recent changes. State of Play of NISD sectoral Incident Response The ENISA 'EU Member States Incident Response Development Status Report' provides a deeper insight into NISD sectoral Incident Response capabilities, procedures, processes and tools to identify the trends and possible gaps and overlaps.  The study was done by involving CSIRTs network members (National, governmental and sectoral CSIRTs) to understand their perspective (as one of the main actors involved) of operational Incident Response (IR) set-up within the NISD sectors. Additionally, an informal expert group was formed in order to have input from specialists in different sectors. Key Findings The main findings of the study include: Organisational culture has an influence on IR set-up within NISD sectors. Concludes that NISD main impact from the perspective of IR was to clarify actors’ roles and responsibilities within the IR organisation. Looks at services specific to their sectors’ needs that sectoral CSIRTs provide, in particular a more in-depth knowledge of the threat and actor landscape, better-adapted tools, solutions and operational expertise. Sectoral cooperation and information-exchange initiatives, their visibility and efficiency. Sectoral level training as key to fostering and enhancing preparedness. Incident Response Capabilities in Europe Incident Response Capabilities (IRC) within the NISD sectors is a growing concern to tackle potential incidents, which could have a major impact on European societies and citizens. ENISA’s Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar, stated:  “The input from national and sectoral CSIRTs as well as the expert group, allowed us to take stock of the current landscape of incident response within the NIS sectors and the findings are essential for establishing or developing sector specific incident response capabilities.” Target Audience This study provides recommendations for Member States and particularly for national and/or governmental CSIRTs and operators of essential services (OES) in the seven sectors identified in the NISD. However, the main objective of the study is for ENISA to gain a better understanding of and draw conclusions about the current status and the recent changes in the European Incident Response landscape.   Further information: The ENISA 'EU Member States Incident Response Development Status Report' The NIS Directive CSIRTs in Europe CSIRTs Network   Press and Media: For further queries or interviews, please contact press@enisa.europe.eu.

ENISA_NEWS_0180	2019-11-27	NEWS	ENISA cybersecurity certification preparation underway	 Today, ENISA is chairing the kick-off meeting in Athens, Greece of the ad-hoc working group to prepare the first cybersecurity certification scheme in accordance with the Cybersecurity Act. Following the request from the European Commission, ENISA has set up an Ad hoc Working group to support the preparation of a candidate cybersecurity certification scheme to serve as a successor to the existing SOG-IS (“Senior Officials Group Information Systems Security“) MRA (Mutual Recognition Agreement), which has 20 years of experience. The scheme looks into common information technology security evaluation criteria, which is likely to improve the internal market conditions of technology products, services and processes. These common criteria have proven particularly efficient for the certification of chips and smartcards and has therefore contributed to enhance the level of security of electronic signature devices, for means of identification such as passports, banking cards, tachographs for lorries. The Working Group is composed of 20 selected members representing industry (developers, evaluators), as well as around 12 participants from accreditation bodies and Members States.   Notes to editors: Further information on Cybersecurity Certification Framework can be found here: Bolstering ENISA in the EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework.   For further queries: Please contact press@enisa.europa.eu   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0181	2019-11-26	PR	How can EU ports tackle new cyber threats?	 State of Play of Port Security Port stakeholders are facing more and more cybersecurity challenges with the emergence of new threats, regulations and increased digitalisation. Major incidents such as ransomware attacks targeting ports had a considerable impact on the economy.  As such, ports must address cybersecurity as a top priority in order to ensure their safety, security, compliance and commercial competitiveness, while unlocking the full capabilities of their digital transformation. In light of increasing digital transformation of port ecosystems, the ENISA Port Cybersecurity - Good practices for cybersecurity in the maritime sector report highlights good practices to address new cybersecurity threats. Specifically, the emergence of the ‘SmartPorts’ concept brings new challenges for the deployment of emerging technologies (IoT, blockchain, big data, cloud, automation, AI etc.) which often leads to greater exposure of port systems. While ports have traditionally been concerned with physical security and safety, they must now integrate cybersecurity in their global strategy. ENISA’s Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar, stated: “Given the economic importance of ports in EU trade, the protection of essential port operations against cyber-attacks becomes paramount. It is important to equip EU ports with all necessary tools and knowledge to address cybersecurity concerns as they undergo their digital transformation. The report aims to provide port authorities and terminal operators, especially those in most need of relevant guidance, with a comprehensive set of good practices.” Key Findings The report lists an extensive set of security measures that port authorities and terminal operators can adopt to develop a security baseline. The main measures identified are described below and intend to serve as good practices for people responsible for cybersecurity implementation in Port Authorities and Terminal Operators: Define a clear governance around cybersecurity at port level, involving all stakeholders involved in port operations. Enforce the technical cybersecurity basics, like network segregation, updates management, password hardening, segregation of rights, etc. Consider security by design in applications, especially as ports use many systems, some of which are opened to third parties for data exchange. Enforce detection and response capabilities at port level to react as fast as possible to any cyberattack before it impacts port operation, safety or security. What does the study hope to achieve for its target audience? Developed in collaboration with several EU ports, this report intends to provide a useful foundation on which CIOs and CISOs of entities involved in the port ecosystem, especially port authorities and terminal operators, can build their cybersecurity strategy. Furthermore, the study can also be useful for other stakeholders in the broader community within the port ecosystem, such shipping companies and maritime policy makers. In particular, this report intends to: Identify the main port infrastructure and services (maritime cargo, passenger and vehicle transport, fishing activities), as well as establish an overview of stakeholders involved in port ecosystems and define a comprehensive asset taxonomy; Establish a high-level reference model describing port systems and the data flows between them and other external systems; List the main cybersecurity challenges that port stakeholders are facing today and are likely to face in the future and define a complete threat taxonomy that lists the different threats and their possible impacts; Describe cyber-attack scenarios that the port ecosystem could face, influenced from cyber-attacks that have already occurred in the maritime sector; and Provide a list of cybersecurity measures that highlight best practices and help improve the cybersecurity maturity of port ecosystems. Next steps Still, people responsible for port cybersecurity are encouraged to go beyond the good practices proposed in the ENISA report and address additional topics as well, such as awareness raising about cybersecurity at board and staff level, information sharing amongst port operators, addressing cybersecurity in the supply chain and integrating interdependencies cybersecurity risks in the overall cyber risk management process. ENISA intends to keep playing its role in the continuous process of strengthening the cybersecurity of the EU maritime sector by addressing key issues and recommendations in the following years, supporting policy and regulatory developments and facilitating information sharing and the exchange of good practices between maritime stakeholders.

ENISA_PR_0182	2019-11-25	PR	ENISA puts Cybersecurity in the driver's seat	 The Arrival of Smart Cars The automotive industry is undergoing an evolution towards connected and autonomous vehicles. Increasingly smart cars include added features that enhance users’ experience or improve car safety. However, if not properly secured, such features can also be leveraged by hackers, and lead to cyberattacks that can result in vehicle immobilisation, road accidents, financial losses, disclosure of sensitive data and even endanger road users’ safety. Previous attacks on smart cars helped raise automotive industry awareness of the security needs and led to the development of several cybersecurity regulations and initiatives aimed at ensuring secure vehicles. Good Practices for Security of Smart Cars The ENISA ‘Good practices for security of Smart Cars’ report mainly aims to identify the relevant assets, the emerging threats targeting smart cars ecosystem of tomorrow as well as the potential security measures and good practices to mitigate them. Concretely, the ENISA study provides the following information: A detailed asset and threat taxonomy for the connected and autonomous vehicles ecosystem. Concrete and actionable good practices to improve the cybersecurity in connected and autonomous vehicles. A mapping of existing legislative, standardisation and policy initiatives to foster harmonisation. In 2017, ENISA published its first study on Smart Cars cybersecurity (The ENISA Cybersecurity and Resilience of smart cars – Good practices and recommendations). In this new report, the Agency broadens the scope of the study to the (semi-) autonomous cars and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In particular, the study gathers in a single document security controls collected from relevant published documents and standards, covering the policies, organisational practices and technical aspects. Inter alia, the proposed security controls are mapped against those mentioned in the draft recommendation on cybersecurity of the UN Working Party on Automated/Autonomous and Connected Vehicles (GRVA). Juhan Lepassaar, Executive Director, ENISA stated: “Connected and automated mobility is a strategic priority for the EU, bringing numerous opportunities for its citizens. Making sure that cybersecurity concerns are taken into account is the role of ENISA. Today we publish a study on securing smart cars with a focus on autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. Bringing together all players and reflecting ongoing policy developments, this work aims to serve as the reference for automotive cybersecurity.” Target Audience As smart cars cybersecurity is a shared task amongst all smart cars stakeholders, the target audience of this study is mainly: Car manufacturers Tier 1 and Tier 2 car components suppliers Aftermarket suppliers Policy Makers   Further information: The ENISA ‘Good practices for security of Smart Cars’ report The ENISA 'Cybersecurity and Resilience of smart cars – Good practices and recommendations'   Press and Media: For further queries or interviews, please contact press@enisa.europe.eu.

ENISA_PR_0184	2019-11-21	PR	ENISA draws Threat Landscape of 5G Networks 	 ENISA with the support of the Member States, the European Commission and an Expert Group, published an extensive report on threats relating to 5G networks. An EU-wide Coordinated Risk Assessment of 5G networks has been published on the 9th October 2019. It contained 10 high-level risk scenarios, based on the national risk assessments by EU Member States. Today’s  ENISA 5G Threat landscape complements the Coordinated Risk Assessment with a more technical and more detailed view on the 5G architecture, the assets and the cyber threats for those assets. The ENISA 5G threat landscape contains: A detailed architecture outlining the most important 5G infrastructure components through 9 detailed zoom-ins of the 5G architectural elements mentioned in the coordinated risk assessment. These include the security architecture, slice architecture, edge computing architecture, software defined networks architecture, physical architecture, and others. Detailed threat assessments for the 5G infrastructure components. The assessed threats refine the threats reviewed in the coordinated risk assessment. Understanding threat exposure ENISA’s Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar, made the following statement: “The arrival of 5G networks brings numerous security challenges just as the technology from 1G to 4G did previously. Today’s report will support stakeholders to carry out more detailed threat analyses and risk assessments focussed on particular elements of the 5G infrastructure to help understand their threat exposure.” The on-going guide for gap analysis 5G infrastructures possess a high degree of complexity due to the multiple features introduced by this technology. While 5G pilots are ongoing, standardisation work is also advancing as do vendor development activities towards migrations to 5G. In this still very dynamic environment, threat and risk assessments will need to be performed in an iterative manner to cover upcoming developments. The developed 5G Risk Assessment and the 5G Threat Landscape are initial steps towards the longer maturity trajectory of 5G infrastructures, their deployment and adoption. They will need to be regularly updated in order to capture those changes appropriately. Certification of 5G components is perceived as a further trigger of threat and risk management activities. Next Steps The 5G toolbox, which are documents produced by the NIS Cooperation group and the Member States with the support of ENISA will be published towards the end of 2019. In this way, the toolbox will provide a number of different directions and options for the Member States to take. Certification of 5G architecture components is a likely action depending on the exact designation of tools under the toolbox initiative carried out. The scope of 5G certification schemes needs to be determined by the European Commission with input from the Member States and duly communicated to ENISA. ENISA will continue engaging on cybersecurity activities of 5G. Coordination with EU-wide activities will be key to the success of secure 5G practices.

ENISA_PR_0185	2019-11-19	PR	How to implement security by design for IoT	 The Rise of IoT and potential attacks The number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices is rising constantly with an expected 25 billion IoT devices to be in use by 2021 according to a Gartner study. Notorious examples of IoT attacks such as Stuxnet and Mirai have led to growing concerns about the security measures of IoT devices. IoT is going to have an impact on every aspect of our lives and we need to be prepared. For many years, ENISA has been working together with the wider community to promote security by design in the IoT ecosystem. Security by Design, fundamental to IoT Security The establishment of secure development guidelines is a fundamental building block for IoT security. The 'Good Practices for Security of IoT report' has a particular focus on software development guidelines, a key aspect for achieving security by design. The study elaborates and delves into this notion by giving specifics on how to securely collect requirements, design, develop, maintain, and even dispose of IoT systems and services. In the context of IoT, a rapidly emerging set of technologies that needs to be holistically secured, such work aims to set the reference point for the development of secure by design solutions. The main contributions of the study include: Analysis of security concerns in all phases of IoT SDLC and key points to consider. Detailed asset and threat taxonomies concerning the IoT secure SDLC. Concrete and actionable good practices to enhance the cybersecurity of the IoT SDLC. Mapping of ENISA good practices to related existing standards, guidelines and schemes. Cybersecurity throughout the software development lifecycle To utilise secure Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) principles is an effective and proactive means to avoid vulnerabilities in IoT and thus contribute in developing software applications and services in a secure manner. ENISA’s Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar, stated: “Taking a step back and looking into the entire lifecycle of IoT products and services, ENISA with the input of IoT experts created security guidelines for the whole lifespan: from requirements and design, to development and maintenance, as well as disposal. The motivation is clear: security is not only about the end product, but also about the processes to be followed to develop the product.” Target Audience This ENISA study outlines good practices for IoT security with a particular focus on securing the SDLC of IoT systems. This entails defining security measures that apply to the entire IoT ecosystem (devices, communications/networks, cloud, etc.) in order to bolster the security of the development process, resulting in devices that are fundamentally more secure. The study is complementary to the previous ENISA work on Baseline IoT Security Recommendations and aims to provide guidelines on how to secure the entire lifecycle of IoT. Given the diverse phases that SDLC entails and the complexity of the IoT ecosystem, the target audience of this study comprises the following profiles: IoT software developers IoT platform, Software Development Kit (SDK) and Application Programming Interface (API) developers and consumers IoT integrators   Further information The ENISA Good Practices for Security of IoT report.

ENISA_NEWS_0186	2019-11-18	NEWS	29th Article 13a telecom security meeting in Belgrade 	 The meeting was opened by Mr. Vladica Tintor, Director of RATEL, who gave an overview of the structure and activities of RATEL. Jovan Milosavljevic gave a great talk on the work of the National Centre for the Prevention of Security Risks in ICT systems, i.e. the national CSIRT, how they work, how breach reporting is set up and what the current priorities are, etc. The national CSIRT is a part of RATEL. The meeting proceeded with liaison statements from related groups like the NIS Cooperation Group, and the NIS CG work streams on digital services and digital infrastructure. ENISA presented its paper on Security Supervision under the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC), which is due to be published in December. The EECC expands the telecom security provisions in Article 13a of the Framework directive and will cover also so-called Over-the-top providers of communications services. At the end of the day ENISA opened discussions about a number of challenges, which will have to be addressed by the group going forward under the new legislative framework, such as the new definition of security in the EECC, the new reporting parameters in the EECC and the new ENISA tool for EECC breach reporting CIRAS (Cyber Incident Reporting and Analysis System). As a social event offered by RATEL the group paid a visit to the Nikola Tesla museum in Belgrade. Tesla was the first to envisage and develop wireless/radio communication technology and he foresaw that indeed such communication technology would drastically change the world. On the second day, each country gave an update on their state of play and relevant recent incidents. ENISA presented a plan and timeline for updating the Article 13a security framework, which needs adaptation for the EECC. BEREC presented the results of its survey on 5G auctions. BAKOM, the telecom regulator of Switzerland, gave an overview of its work on power outages and their impact on telecom networks. The Article 13a group will change name and, where needed, membership, to adapt to the new legislation, the EECC. In 2020, much of the work of the group will be dedicated to updating the guidelines for security measures and to adapt the incident reporting process to the new provisions. If you like to know more about this work, or if you want to join our telecom security mailing lists to be kept up to date about our telecom security work or to receive invitations for future telecom security meetings, please contact us via resilience@enisa.europa.eu    Background This work is done under ENISA's Annual work program output O.1.2.3 “Supporting incident reporting activities in the EU” The ENISA Article 13a expert group was set up in 2010.

ENISA_NEWS_0187	2019-11-15	NEWS	GDPR & deploying pseudonymisation techniques	 Pseudonymisation is a well-known de-identification process that has gained additional attention following the adoption of GDPR, where it is referenced as both a security and data protection by design mechanism. In addition, in the GDPR context, pseudonymisation can motivate the relaxation, to a certain degree, of data controllers’ legal obligations if properly applied. Given the growing importance of pseudonymisation for several data processing sectors, the main objective of the ULD-ENISA workshop, held in Berlin, was to advance existing debates on the deployment of pseudonymisation solutions as a means to meet GDPR requirements and data controller/processor obligations. To this end, the workshop aimed to discuss and touch upon core pseudonymisation techniques, practical approaches and existing application instantiations along to legal and economic issues. One of the main outcomes of the workshop was that there is not one single pseudonymisation solution that could be applied in all cases. Indeed, while several different technical approaches are available today, a risk assessment process should provide for the best possible one for each particular case, based on the context and the desired utility level. Further work is, thus, needed as regards practical examples and real-life implementation scenarios, both on the technical, as well as on the legal side. For further information and material about the workshop, please visit the dedicated page: ULD - ENISA Workshop: Pseudonymisation and relevant security technologies. ENISA will be publishing a report entitled ‘Pseudonymisation techniques and best practices’ in the coming week. The report aims to contribute to and advance the relevant discussions in the field, regarding practical implementation of data pseudonymisation.   For queries: Please contact press@enisa.europa.eu     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

Exercise CyLEEx19, organised by Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), painted a dark scenario, inspired by malicious cyber activities affecting the public and private sector across Europe and beyond. Participants were called upon to react collectively to the simulated large-scale cyber-attacks related to incidents such as misuse of IT resources, unauthorised access to systems, vulnerability exploitations, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), and malware infections. Participants were asked to respond to these cyber incidents and decide on the optimal response measures, including if such threats warrant the triggering of the emergency response procedure. By performing the majority of the processes documented in the Protocol, the participants increased their preparedness in case of a real-life international cyber-attack and identified possibilities for improvement of the process. Cybercrime investigators from the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (J-CAT), namely France (Police Nationale), the Netherlands (Politie), Spain (Policia Nacional) and Norway (Politiet) took part in this exercise, alongside representatives from EC3’s Advisory Groups on financial services (Banco Santander and Citi) and the internet security industry (Palo Alto Networks), together with experts from Europol, ENISA and Eurojust.   The EU Law Enforcement Emergency Response Protocol In the wake of the 2017 WannaCry and NotPetya attacks, the Council of the European Union adopted the new EU Law Enforcement Emergency Response Protocol to address the growing problem of planning and coordinating between governments, agencies, and companies when cyber-attacks occur across international boundaries. The Protocol is part of the EU Blueprint for Coordinated Response to Large-Scale Cross-Border Cybersecurity Incidents and Crises (Commission Recommendation (EU) 2017/1584 of 13 September 2017 on coordinated response to large-scale cybersecurity incidents and crises C/2017/6100). The EU Law Enforcement Emergency Response Protocol determines the procedures, roles and responsibilities of key players both within the EU and beyond; secure communication channels and 24/7 contact points for the exchange of critical information; as well as the overall coordination and de-confliction mechanism. This cyber simulation exercise was developed within the EMPACT 2019 Operational Action Plan Cyber Attacks against Information Systems (CAIS) under the leadership of France as action leader. The exercise is also part of the cooperation framework set up under the Memorandum of Understanding signed by European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), the European Defence Agency (EDA), the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) and the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions, Agencies and Bodies (CERT-EU). The outcomes of the exercise and the feedback provided by the participants in the evaluation stage will be analysed by Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre and ENISA. Detailed lessons learned will be set forth in order to establish a list of actions to improve cyber resilience and the emergency response to large-scale cyber-attacks in Europe and beyond.

ENISA_PR_0190	2019-10-31	PR	5th eHealth Security Conference: ENISA advises on cybersecurity for hospitals	 The conference took place in the margins of the Barcelona Cybersecurity Congress and covered multiple topics particularly incident reporting; good cybersecurity practices for health care organizations with a focus on procurement; demos for hacking medical devices and Cyber Europe; and ultimately, future strategies to increase the level of awareness in the health sector. An audience of around 100 stakeholders, including around 20 speakers and panellists gathered to support the event’s moto: Working together towards secure eHealth. ENISA’s Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar, stated: “Cybersecurity remains a joint responsibility and the active involvement of all relevant stakeholders in the annual eHealth Cybersecurity conference is required for raising the sector’s cybersecurity maturity and positioning. ENISA is assisting Member States in building cybersecurity in the Healthcare sector, enhancing its policy role”. Thus, this important annual conference proves a platform for policy makers, regulators, operators, manufacturers and other stakeholders from the healthcare sector to discuss and exchange good practices on the subject of eHealth security. High-level speakers at the event included Francisco de Paula Polo Llavata, Spanish Secretary of State for Digital Advancement, Ministry of Economy and Business; Jordi Puigneró i Ferrer, Counselor of Digital Policy and Public Administration, Generalitat de Catalunya; Marco Marsella Head of eHealth, Well-Being and Ageing Unit at DG CONNECT; Evangelos Ouzounis, Head of Secure Infrastructures and Services Unit at ENISA. eHealth Cybersecurity Policy & Incident Reporting Representatives of different Member States shared their experiences and lessons learned when addressing eHealth Security at a national level, covering among others topics: Sectorial National Cybersecurity Strategies for Healthcare Healthcare CSIRTs Sectorial incident reporting Meeting cybersecurity objectives via good procurement practices ENISA presented the preliminary findings of its 2019 study on procurement guidelines for hospitals, which will be published later in the year, while speakers bringing the perspective of healthcare organisations and medical device/system suppliers shared their views on how procurement can be improved to address cybersecurity Hacking healthcare In addition to the demos, ENISA presented how healthcare organisations and other stakeholders can test their preparedness to deal with these and other incidents in practice: Cyber Europe 2020. Next year, the upcoming cyber incident and crisis management exercise will focus on the healthcare sector and will involve healthcare stakeholders of both the public and private sectors from the EU and EFTA Member States. A very lively session demonstrated concrete examples of how healthcare assets such as medical devices can be hacked in practice and compromise the privacy of users and protection of such devices. A glimpse at the future of eHealth Cybersecurity and key conclusions The final session gave the audience a glimpse at the future of eHealth Cybersecurity with presentations emphasising the importance of and need to focus on raising awareness around cybersecurity within healthcare professionals. Two presentations highlighted how this issue can be tackled and what some concrete benefits of increased awareness might be. DG SANTE concluded the Conference by presenting the evolving policy and regulatory context at an EU level. ENISA’s work on eHealth Cybersecurity and future strategic objectives ENISA intends to keep playing its role in this continuous process by addressing key issues and recommendations in the following years, such as: Supporting policy and regulatory initiatives and promoting good cybersecurity practices in the healthcare sector. ENISA will keep working on supporting initiatives related to information sharing within the sector. Cybersecurity is key to improve the most important thing we have: health. Next Cyber Excercise in 2020 will be focused on healthcare, a critical infrastructure to protect. Coordination in cyber exercises of this kind is essential for reporting incidents among the healthcare sector. Support in building cybersecurity awareness strategies and training methodologies among healthcare providers, staff, doctors.

ENISA_PR_0191	2019-10-25	PR	Trustworthy AI requires solid Cybersecurity	" ENISA, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity and Europol, the EU Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, co-organised successfully their third annual IoT Security Conference on the 24th and 25th of October in Athens looking at the evolution of IoT security and how to implement adequate security measures. Beyond technical aspects, the adoption of IoT and emergence of AI has raised many new legal, policy and regulatory challenges, broad and complex in scope. In order to address these challenges, cooperation across different sectors and among different stakeholders is essential. It is for these reasons that Europol and ENISA are jointly organising such an event, to facilitate a discussion among all interested parties on ways to address the security challenges of IoT and AI and to combat the criminal abuse of such technologies, ultimately making cyberspace a safer place for all.  ENISA’s Head of Core Operations, Steve Purser, stated: “The annual IoT Security Conference keeps up with the trends of new opportunities and challenges of emerging technologies. This 3rd edition focuses on the impact of IoT and AI technologies. As these technologies are being deployed across various sectors, cybersecurity is a primary condition for trustworthy IoT and AI. ENISA is prepared to support technical aspects as well as policy with regards to ethics and a coordinated strategy on AI and liability. I welcome the collaboration with Europol and I am confident that such joint efforts contribute significantly to ensuring a safer and secure connected future for all.” Steven Wilson, Head of Europol's European Cybercrime Centre, said: ""The importance of the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence has become undeniable, as these technologies have the potential to help us respond to societal challenges while making our lives more efficient. Both the public and private sector are devoting significant efforts to maximise the opportunities of these developments. Europol focuses on how IoT and AI can enhance law enforcement capability with respect to fighting and investigating crimes, while reflecting and identifying how criminals can and will abuse their potential. Through our joint work with ENISA at the IoT Security Conference, we can proactively respond and ensure that we anticipate the next criminal move while simultaneously protecting citizens across the EU, and ensuring that the benefits of these technologies prevail."" IoT Security Attacks Over the last few years, prominent examples of IoT attacks have made media headlines such as the hacking of pacemakers and smart toys for kids. Even artificial intelligence algorithms have been manipulated, leading to erroneous decision-making such as spoofing of traffic lights and false image recognition. With IoT technologies, the digital and the physical worlds are no longer kept apart from one another. Cars, medical devices, factories and energy plants are all becoming increasingly interconnected, creating new types of threats against critical infrastructure. Europol's and ENISA's efforts on IoT security ENISA has a strong record in IoT security, publishing many reports on the subject, identifying security threats and risks and providing recommendations to strengthen its security, such as the Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT. On the other hand, Europol has been researching the many advantages of the Internet of Things for law enforcement as a tool to fight crime. Data from connected devices at a crime scene can provide crucial evidence to an investigation but such data require the same safeguards and security standards to ensure the privacy and safety of citizens. It has also successfully supported operations targeting the criminal abuse of IoT devices such as ‘Operation PowerOff’. Working towards a more secure and safe future of AI The conference pointed out that one of the biggest challenges brought about by AI is the question of trust. Future AI deployments need to be secured appropriately, for instance by establishing a platform to promote collaboration on the cybersecurity aspects of AI in the EU. ENISA can help build understanding on AI building blocks and their interplay, engage stakeholders in dialogues for AI cybersecurity and encourage collaboration and establish synergies, as well as raise awareness on AI cybersecurity. Equally law enforcement needs to be in a position to address the criminal abuse of AI as well as adversarial AI for instance in the form of data poisoning or the manipulation of algorithms. There is a close relationship between AI and data governance. For machine learning algorithms to be effective, it is essential to have relevant training data and to control this learning process to avoid any bias. Conclusions and actionable suggestions Security should not be an afterthought when designing systems and products, IoT and Artificial Intelligence are no exception; The inclusion of law enforcement enables a response beyond defence and incident response by being able to investigate and prosecute the criminals abusing connected devices; Building on the cooperation in IoT security, law enforcement and the cybersecurity community need to work closely together to address the criminal abuse and security of AI; There is a need to discuss digital forensics in regard to Artificial Intelligence and IoT and the importance of data and privacy protection, considering the amount and different categories of data collected by these algorithms and the possibility to manipulate them; Whereas horizontal guidelines to ensure IoT and AI security are much needed, it is also important to look into sectorial implementations such as autonomous cars, industrial automation, automation of cybersecurity operations, to name a few. ENISA will be soon publishing guidelines on securing the software development process for IoT, as well as on cybersecurity of autonomous vehicles. IoT and AI are part of a wider interlinked emerging technologies ecosystem that also comprises 5G and Cloud computing; the interplay between all these elements needs to be considered when addressing cybersecurity.   Further information: For further queries or interviews, please contact press@enisa.europe.eu or press@europol.europa.eu   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0194	2019-10-16	PR	The EU Agency for Cybersecurity welcomes its new Executive Director: Mr. Juhan Lepassaar	 He will be leading the Agency, which has just achieved a permanent mandate within the provisions of the Cybersecurity Act (CSA) upgrading ENISA to a new phase of its history. Mr. Juhan Lepassaar is a citizen of Estonia. Dedicated to the European Union, he has been a strong supporter of the development of the cybersecurity policy as Head of Cabinet of Andrus Ansip, Vice President for the Digital Single Market in the European Commission for the past 5 years. It is within his previous function as Director for EU affairs at the Government Office of Estonia that Mr. Lepassaar had been initially given the chance to engage in cybersecurity policy. On his first day at ENISA, Mr. Lepassaar expressed that “Cybersecurity permeates all sectors. The cybersecurity issues at stake are now widely recognised as crucial for Europe on the political level not just the technical level. Member States have come to agree on the need to increase cooperation and make joint efforts to develop a common approach meant to strengthen the European cyberspace.” He expressed his vision for the Agency, stating “My vision for the Agency builds on two pillars, the NIS Directive* and the Cybersecurity Act. Developing further synergies, establishing and elaborating activities including making the certification proposal not only a reality but a success, increasing the opinions ENISA provides on NIS areas, growing the pool of competences for more targeted assistance, further cooperation within the NIS framework through dialogue via the CSIRTs network and cyber exercises and finally raising further awareness of cybersecurity and cyber hygiene.” Over its lifespan, ENISA has increased its visibility and impact in Europe thanks to its expertise, notably in developing and supporting incident reporting, national cybersecurity strategies and exercises among others to keep the European cyberspace not only secured but also equipped to manage cyber-attacks or cyber crisis in the fastest and most effective ways. With the CSA, the Agency has now acquired new responsibilities such as the Cybersecurity Certification Framework and an increased role in cyber crisis coordination and response, tools that address all aspects of the challenges ahead of us in securing the European Digital Single Market.   * EU Network and Information Security Directive.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0201	2019-09-30	PR	European Cybersecurity Month 2019 is launched	"    The 2019 campaign focuses on different themes addressing the need for behavioural change and identifying opportunities to help users recognise the risks of new technologies. The first theme encompasses basic ‘Cyber Hygiene’, which uses the hygiene metaphor to inform about good cybersecurity habits that are part of everyone’s daily routine. Having healthy cyber safety practices can provide users with more confidence using their devices, whether it’s a computer, a smart phone, a wearable device or any other gadget that’s connected to the internet. The key take-home message conveys that cyber hygiene is a habit you learn from a young age and remains a daily routine for life. The second theme concentrates on ‘Emerging Technology’ and recognises the importance of keeping you and your new tech gadgets and devices secure. Technology is developing fast and it is important to question the security and privacy settings for your new purchases. For this theme, citizens will be guided around the topics they should be aware of when it comes to new technology. European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society Mariya Gabriel said: ""Today we launch European Cybersecurity Month 2019, we are boosting awareness around online safety and the cybersecurity skills needed for the future. If we want to complete the Digital Single Market, it is essential we ensure EU citizens, particularly young people have the knowledge and skills to protect themselves online. It is our shared responsibility for all citizens to become responsible users of emerging technologies.""  ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht said: “Cyber threats are evolving at a rapid pace and human behaviour can play a fundamental role in how we stay cyber secure. Ensuring that all citizens are aware of online risks and have the tools to become more resilient and confident users is a key goal of European Cybersecurity Month. This October, we urge everyone to stay alert with new technology and establish strong cyber hygiene habits.” Today to launch the campaign, ENISA has published a video that will provide citizens with simple awareness checks to undertake in their daily lives. Furthermore ENISA is organising an ‘Ask Me Anything’ session on Twitter on 30th September at 10:00 CET, for citizens and organisations to pose general cybersecurity questions on how to secure their devices to the EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA).    Notes to editors: ECSM is the European Union’s annual awareness raising campaign dedicated to promoting cybersecurity among citizens and organisations, providing up-to-date security information.

ENISA_NEWS_0202	2019-09-26	NEWS	ENISA publishes new NCSS map at 7th NCSS workshop	 During the workshop, ENISA also presented the preliminary results of a study about innovation in cybersecurity as a strategic priority of NCSS, which will be published later this year. All Member States of the European Union produce a National Cybersecurity Strategy as a feature of their cybersecurity policy. These National Cybersecurity Strategies provide plans of actions and priorities to improve the security and resilience of national infrastructures and services. Steve Purser, Head of Core Operations, ENISA said: “The cyber threat landscape is changing constantly and at a rapid pace. Member States cybersecurity strategies therefore need priorities and actions that reflect these challenges and the National Cybersecurity Strategies mapping provides guidance and best practices to follow.” ENISA’s ROLE on the National Cybersecurity Strategies ENISA analyses these strategies and their implementation and provides guidance and tools to assist Member States in in their efforts to enhance cybersecurity at a national level. A key support for Member States created by ENISA is the NCSS interactive map. This interactive map lists all the NCSS within the European Union together with best practices to follow.

""We are proud to participate in the organisation of the 6th Network and Information Security (NIS) Summer School, and to celebrate the Memorandum of Understanding that both Institutions have signed. The Foundation for Research and Technology places special emphasis on the field of Network and Information Security. NIS summer school provides an ample opportunity for scientific interactions and successful collaborations between ENISA and FORTH, as it directly impinges on multiple facets of their research activities.” stated Nektarios Tavernarakis, Chairman of the Board of Directors of FORTH. The conference had specialised break-out sessions in the following four areas; Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), Incident Management, Cyber Defence and Cryptography. These break-out sessions allowed participants to gain a deeper knowledge of specific areas of expertise while also partaking in exercises to develop hands-on practical skills. Research shows that there is a vast number of incidents that take place in Europe as globally, so the question is not “if” but “when”. The Summer School hopes to build a high-standard cybersecurity knowledge for the challenges ahead and support technical capabilities to analyse threats and manage incidents. Key Outcomes from Trainings Cooperation and information sharing are key to improving cybersecurity, therefore the collaboration between the training teams is seeing as part of the hands-on experience. There was an excellent exchange of knowledge amongst participants with different backgrounds, from cyber defence to incident management and threat intelligence. The event combined lectures, exercises with team building, which provided attendees with a good balance of theory and practice. The time pressure that participants underwent in the scenarios simulated a real-life response. Attendees learned how to better support the planning process with actionable intelligence. The event encourages networking amongst academic, public sector and private sector attendees and speakers Background Information ENISA and FORTH through the Summer School, bring together a distinguished faculty from around the world with the purpose to identify current trends, threats and opportunities against the background of recent advances on NIS measures and policies. Recognising the multi-dimensional facets and intricacies causing changes in the information risks landscape, an array of lectures will cover a variety of key aspects on policy, economic, legal and research matters. By going through a natural evolution cycle, but also by adopting current trends in networking and exchange of knowledge, this year’s Summer School aimed at increasing interaction among participants via targeted breakout sessions and trainings, which will enhance dialogue and exchange of ideas. The audience included policy makers from EU Member States and EU Institutions, decision makers from industry and members of the academic community.

ENISA_NEWS_0209	2019-09-04	NEWS	Improving Communication and Information Sharing Across Incident Response Communities	 These are required to facilitate information exchange among teams and improve reaction time to security incidents. The methodology presented could also be valid for other operational teams grouped in an information sharing and analysis centre (ISAC). The goal is to provide a methodology and to illustrate what criteria they could consider when selecting communication solutions that can fit their size and needs. As of June 2019 there are more than 414 incident response teams in Europe. These teams work together to respond to cyber-attacks and need to use secure and reliable communication channels to share threat and incident information while protecting European citizens and businesses. These incident response teams are often organized in communities such as CSIRTs Network, TF-CSIRT, FIRST and other regional, sub regional or sectorial communities and they continuously communicate and exchange information. Typical information exchanged among teams include threat intelligence, indicators of compromise (IoCs), malware samples and details about relevant incidents. Previous ENISA work on the topic Since 2005, ENISA has been supporting Member States and CSIRT communities in EU to build and advance their incident response capabilities with handbooks, online & onsite trainings and dedicated projects. ENISA’s portfolio of work is related to setting up, running or developing capabilities of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs).  The goal is to define minimum common baseline practices across the EU to improve operational cooperation, preparedness and information exchange for the next generation of cyber-attacks.  More info can be found at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/csirt-maturity For the full report Secure Group Communications for incident response and operational communities For further information ENISA CSIRTs by Country - Interactive Map CSIRTs Network     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0215	2019-07-15	NEWS	Annual report Trust Services Security Incidents 2018	 The document gives an aggregated overview of security breaches with significant impact reported in 2018 by EU national supervisory bodies. It shows root causes, statistics and trends, and marks the third round of security incident reporting for the EU’s trust services sector. According to the eIDAS regulation, trust service providers must notify these security breaches to their national supervisory body. The annual summary reporting for 2018 totalled 18 incident reports. A total of 28 EU countries and one 1 EFTA country take part in annual summary reporting. Key statistics relating to the 2018 incidents Malicious actions and system failures are the dominant root causes of reported incidents: System failures amount for 39% of the total incidents (consistent with 36% in 2017). Malicious actions have gone up to 39% (compared to 7% in 2017). A few, but critical security breaches with cross border impact: Some 25% of the reported incidents had a cross-border impact. Although the ratio is small, the seriousness of the incidents was high: 75% of them were classified as level 4 – severe and 5 – disastrous. Qualified e-signatures certificates creation – the most affected service: Roughly 50% of the incidents reported affected the qualified creation of qualified certificates for e-signatures. The EU Agency for Cybersecurity ENISA ENISA will provide advice and input on the upcoming eIDAS review by the Commission, due mid-2020. The Agency will also continue to support the national supervisory bodies with implementing the breach reporting under Article 19 eIDAS and to work towards making this process efficient and effective, yielding useful data, for the supervising bodies, for the authorities of other sectors, as well as for the trust service providers and the organisations relying on these trust services.  Outlook The cooperation network of authorities for national electronic identity systems and the group of national supervisory bodies for the electronic trust services market will benefit from the close collaboration on security supervision and information sharing about incidents, threats, good practices, etc. Basic situational awareness about vulnerabilities and large-scale threats will help the supervisory bodies to do a more effective supervision. ENISA will continue to facilitate information sharing between the relevant authorities and supervisory bodies. A close connection with regular exchange and updates about past incidents, threats, good practices, etc. between eIDAS, the European Electronic Communication Code (EECC) and the Digital infrastructures part of the NIS Directive is important, because these are closely related areas. ENISA will facilitate this and act as a bridge. For the full report: Trust Services Security Incidents 2018 - Annual report Background information Electronic trust services are a range of services around digital signatures, digital certificates, electronic seals, timestamps, etc. which are used in electronic transactions, to make them secure. eIDAS, an EU regulation, is the EU wide legal framework ensuring interoperability and security of these electronic trust services across the EU. One of the goals of eIDAS is to ensure that electronic transactions can have the same legal standing as traditional paper based transactions. eIDAS is important for the European digital market because it allows businesses and citizens to work and use services across the EU. The eIDAS regulation was adopted in July 2014 and came into force in 2016.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0216	2019-07-12	NEWS	ENISA Panel on Digital Sovereignty at CODE Annual Conference	 Titled ‘How to Achieve Digital Sovereignty of Europe’, the panel saw the participation of high-level members: Klaus Vitt, State Secretary, Federal Ministry of Interior, Building and Community, Benedikt Zimmer, State Secretary, Federal Ministry of Defence, Roberto Viola, Director General, DG CONNECT, European Commission, Jorge Domecq, Executive Director, European Defence Agency, and Evert Dudok, Executive Vice President Communications, Intelligence and Security, Airbus Defence and Space. Discussions revolved around current hot topics on the EU agenda, namely: What exactly is digital sovereignty? Is there a clear priority or challenge that relates to digital sovereignty in Europe? Are there possible mechanisms or clear responses to strengthen the EU’s position in the global digital society? Should this be driven by regulation, academic research, and/or subvention of public funding? From a global perspective: how should Europe respond to the current market development and strength of global tech giants from outside the EU? Should Europe create its own champions? Should Europe invest in specific niches and further intensify its innovation by using the strength of its SMEs? Should the EU change or develop specific regulation to support digital sovereignty? What kind of cooperation model has the most potential for success? What would be the role of government, industry and academia on local, national and European level? On this occasion, Mr. Helmbrecht also launched ENISA’s consultation paper ‘EU ICT Industrial Policy: Breaking the Cycle of Failure’, a paper that aims to explore, amongst other topics, the area of digital sovereignty. He noted that the outcomes of this consultation will serve as input for a further publication and input into the discussions with the new European Commission and European Parliament. The paper looks into the strengths and shortcomings of the ICT industrial policy in the EU from a cybersecurity perspective, with a view to how Europe can do better, and how the development of EU cybersecurity industry in the years to come can be rendered a success.  “The question is if and why are examples of European leadership in ICT beginning to fade. Is there insufficient coordination in relation to cybersecurity in the EU? Could resources be deployed more efficiently? These are some of the questions that are being presented for discussion. We look forward to receiving your input into this consultation”, said Mr. Helmbrecht. Secondly, ENISA also gave a workshop at the conference on ‘Challenges and Application of Threat Intelligence’ introducing our CTI Capability Framework and Maturity Model in the annual threat landscape report. Finally, ENISA’s Head of Core Operations, Steve Purser moderated the workshop ‘Digital Souvereignty - A Must for Europe’ which provided a discussion on how a policy shift can be achieved and how we can move towards a more competitive and more digitally sovereign European ICT sector.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0217	2019-07-10	NEWS	ENISA puts out EU ICT Industrial Policy paper for consultation	" The paper serves as the basis for a consultation, where ENISA seeks the views of citizens, private and public stakeholders on how the European market may be understood and improved. Interested parties are invited to submit their comments by 30 September 2019 by filling in the electronic survey. The outcomes of this consultation will serve as input for a further publication and input into the discussions with the new European Commission and European Parliament. The paper looks into the strengths and shortcomings of the ICT industrial policy in the EU from a cybersecurity perspective, with a view to how Europe can do better, and how the development of EU cybersecurity industry in the years to come can be rendered a success. The paper identifies the current European ICT state-of-play, where in an average European office, ICT software and hardware are generally built and developed in Asia and the USA. Where Europe once led the world in the deployment of initially analogue and then mobile telecommunications technology such as GSM, Europe is now debating the appropriateness of the supply of 5G technology from non-European suppliers. Traditional EU mobile handset manufacturers are struggling to compete with major Asian and US suppliers. Moreover, successful European businesses have been or are often acquired by larger companies from outside the EU. It is surprising to see how the European ICT industry is falling behind in the global competition race, while according to the European Commission, the EU Member States are among the most digitally advanced in the world. Executive Director of ENISA Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht: “The question is if and why are examples of European leadership in ICT beginning to fade. Is there insufficient coordination in relation to cybersecurity in the EU? Could resources be deployed more efficiently? These are some of the questions that are being presented for discussion. We look forward to receiving your input into this consultation.” The public consultation was announced by the executive director, Udo Helmbrecht at the CODE conference 2019, where he moderated a panel titled ""How to Achieve Digital Sovereignty of Europe?"". The panel of high-level speakers included Klaus Vitt, State Secretary, Federal Ministry of Interior, Building and Community, Benedikt Zimmer, State Secretary, Federal Ministry of Defence, Roberto Viola, Director-General Communications Networks, Content and Technology, European Commission, Jorge Domecq, Executive Director, European Defence Agency and Evert Dudok, Executive Vice President Communications, Intelligence and Security, Airbus Defence and Space.

ENISA_PR_0221	2019-06-26	PR	The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity - A new chapter for ENISA	" The Cybersecurity Act gives ENISA a reinforced role in cybersecurity with new tasks. The Agency has also been given additional financial and human resources to address these tasks. ENISA Executive Director, Udo Helmbrecht, stated: “I welcome the Cybersecurity Act and thank the Council, European Parliament and Commission for their support in the drafting and passing of this important piece of cybersecurity legislation. I also welcome the reinforced role of ENISA in the European cybersecurity ecosystem and the opportunity for ENISA to support the Digital Single Market. I believe the European Cybersecurity Certification Framework detailed in the Act will play a leading role for the advancement and harmonisation of cybersecurity certification in Europe and beyond. ENISA will have market related tasks, notably by preparing ‘European cybersecurity certification schemes’ that will serve as the basis for certification of ICT products, processes and services. ENISA is looking forward to working with Member States, the EU Institutions and industry to deliver the tasks set out in the Cybersecurity Act.” Commissioner Mariya Gabriel, EU Commissioner in charge of Digital Economy and Society, stated: ""The EU Cybersecurity Act has demonstrated the urgency to opt for an EU approach in this sensitive area. To respond to this political imperative, Europe has reinforced its Agency for Cybersecurity ENISA. It is crucial for citizens, businesses and Member States to feel more secure, including in cases of large-scale cross-border cyber-attacks. The Cybersecurity Act also enables EU-wide cybersecurity certification for the very first time, thus boosting the Single Market for cybersecurity. Through the Cybersecurity Act, the Directive on the security of networks and information systems and the proposed European Cybersecurity Competence Centre, we have put forward a strong EU pattern, based on values and open for strengthening cooperation with international partners.” A new chapter One of the biggest changes brought about by this EU Regulation is that ENISA will have a permanent mandate and will be renamed as the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity. Additionally, the Agency is henceforth mandated to perform the following new tasks: Cybersecurity certification ENISA has a pivotal role in the new Cybersecurity Act in that the Agency will play a key role in the development of the EU Cybersecurity certification framework by preparing candidate certification schemes. Cybersecurity certification is a new policy area at EU level. In delivering this task the Agency will provide high quality technical and policy support to stakeholders. Upon request from the European Commission or the European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG) composed of Member States, ENISA will coordinate the preparation of candidate cybersecurity certification schemes. The candidate schemes prepared by ENISA and with the cooperation of national certification authorities and industry experts will be submitted to the European Commission for adoption. It is expected that the development and delivery of cybersecurity certification schemes will make it easier for businesses to trade across borders and for buyers to better understand the security features of the product or service. Cyber resilience ENISA shall support capacity-building and preparedness across the Union by assisting the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, as well as Member States and public and private stakeholders, to increase the protection of their network and information systems, to develop and improve cyber resilience and response capacities, and to develop skills and competencies in the field of cybersecurity. At the EU level, ENISA will continue to support the coordination of responses to large-scale cyber-attacks and crises, in cases where two or more EU Member States are affected. This includes the possibility for the Agency to carry out post-incident analysis, when requested by the Member States. This will improve the Union’s response to cyber-attacks, improve cyber resilience and increase trust in the EU Digital Single Market. Policy ENISA will actively support the European Commission and Member States in developing and implementing upcoming European cybersecurity policies. The Act will provide an opportunity for the Agency to apply its knowledge and experience towards the future vision of EU cybersecurity. Vulnerability Disclosure Furthermore, ENISA will assist Member States and Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in establishing and implementing vulnerability disclosure policies on a voluntary basis. The way forward The Act provides for a number of statutory bodies, namely the Management Board, National Liaison Officers Group and the new Advisory Group (formerly known as the Permanent Stakeholder Group). In terms of the certification framework, ENISA will shortly start developing candidate certification schemes. The Agency will closely work with the relevant expert groups set up by the CSA: the European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG) comprised of representatives from Member States, which will have to appoint the representatives from their competent authorities, and the Stakeholder Cybersecurity Certification Group (SCCG), which will be responsible to advise ENISA and the Commission. ENISA in a nutshell ENISA was set up in 2004 to work on a wide range of topics on network and information security. The Agency has been supporting the EU Commission and the Member States by giving guidance on the technicalities of network and information security, thus contributing to the proper functioning of the internal market. Aside from the new tasks, ENISA’s priorities include critical information infrastructure protection, the NIS Directive, capacity-building activities such as cybersecurity exercises, standardisation and certification, provision of consolidated threat information to its stakeholder community, identification and dissemination of best practices on how to mitigate threats associated with new technologies, and supporting EU legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and eIDAS - the Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market.

ENISA_PR_0223	2019-06-13	PR	Security and Privacy, Two Sides of the Same Coin	 The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been a turning point for personal data protection measures in Europe and it complements the legal framework in force in the area of privacy in telecommunications. As the legal landscape shifts towards the implementation phase of the GDPR and the ongoing legislative scrutiny of the draft ePrivacy Regulation, challenges at hand call for a suitable response from policy makers. On 13 and 14 June 2019, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity ENISA, the University of Rome Tor Vergata, the European Commission’s DG CONNECT and LUISS University have organised the 7th Annual Privacy Forum 2019 in Rome, Italy. The Annual Privacy Forum (APF) has become a renowned forum for exchange among policy makers and implementers in the area of privacy and data protection. Over the last years the APF has received recognition across industry players, to complement its original research and policy orientation. In the advent of the publication of Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA, the Agency is seeking to contribute further to the area of personal data protection and privacy under its renewed mandate. Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, Mr. Giovanni Buttarelli, the European Data Protection Supervisor, and Mr. Peter Eberl representing DG Connect have delivered keynote speeches. Other notable speakers at this year's edition of the ENISA’s APF include: Prof. Paola Severino (LUISS Guido Carli University), Mr. Giuseppe Busia (The Italian Data Protection Authority, Garante), Prof. Ross Anderson (Cambridge University) and UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy, Prof. Joe Cannataci. During the 2-day event, discussions cover such areas as security measures in personal data protection, privacy by design, privacy by default, information and users' rights, artificial intelligence, certification in personal data protection, users' rights, IoT security and privacy, sharing cyber threat intelligence under the general data protection regulation, and the landscape of cybercrime. The APF has been organised in a context where electronic communication networks and interconnected digital services have become ubiquitous as they have permeated every fold of everyday life. Automated profiling and electronic surveillance have become commodities. ENISA Executive Director, Udo Helmbrecht stated that “the GDPR has provided a robust legal framework on data protection, which stipulates that security is a data protection principle. However with the substantial number of large-scale data breaches, there is a need for new security models for personal data protection. While the GDPR is a starting point for compliance and service, implementation remains an challenging affair. In terms of security measures, ENISA has been providing guidance, tools and community building for privacy and data protection over the years with the Annual Privacy Forum being one of its strongest instruments, thanks to the various communities engaged and the level of expertise involved. The new ENISA Regulation gives the Agency more latitude to engage with its public and private stakeholders alike.” The European Data Protection Supervisor, Giovanni Buttarelli stated that “the EU has opened a new chapter not only for data protection but also for critical infrastructure security. In the EU, all DPAs, not just a few of them, need to work with ENISA and information security experts to implement 'security by design' - because cybersecurity no longer consists of a set of simply defensive measures.” Professor Paola Severino from LUISS shared some of the challenges for privacy from the legal point of view. “The evolution of the digital world is a source of ever-growing new opportunities for business and scientific innovation, and yet it also increasingly exposes individuals and legal entities to a broad range of risks that would have been inconceivable just a few years ago. Given this context, in the field of personal data protection what has emerged is a need to address the increasing difficulty in protecting privacy against complex cyberattacks and pervasive new surveillance tools. This also calls for a rethinking of the legal instruments required to combat such a phenomenon, by enhancing prevention and normative compliance and by adapting criminal law in response to the new challenges posed by technological transformations.” Finally, chair of this year’s Annual Privacy Forum, Maurizio Naldi gave the following information regarding the event, “the subject of privacy protection has gained an ever increasing attention over the years.  Spurred by the search for improved privacy protection means, my research group on Cybersecurity and Data protection at the University of Rome Tor Vergata has investigated the design of innovative true anonymization algorithms (as opposed to pseudonymization). We employ signal processing techniques to preserve first- and second-order statistical accuracy in the response to database queries, but do not release any information concerning the specific individuals present in the database. Such methods represent a significant step forward in reconciling the quest for anonymization and data utility at the same time, which is a major issue in the current research on data protection.” The draft Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications is expected to give new impetus to the way in which privacy is protected in electronic communications. To meet the challenge in the way personal data is processed and privacy is protected across the EU and beyond, requires examining the stakes at hand. The next edition of the APF will take place in Lisbon, Portugal in June 2020, in co-operation with the Universidade Católica Portuguesa.

ENISA_NEWS_0224	2019-06-13	NEWS	Vision for a Stronger Cybersecurity Community going forward – an ENISA industry event	 The year 2019 already marks a challenging year for the European Union. The EU is facing multiple geopolitical challenges simultaneously, such as Brexit, but also cybersecurity related challenges such as maintaining EU’s digital sovereignty and securing European elections from outside interference. The EU is confronted with finding the right balance between the digital transformation of our society and preserving our core democratic values. We must ensure that the EU ICT industry retains and develops essential cybersecurity technological capacities to secure its EU Digital Single Market. The Union must be in a position to autonomously secure its digital assets and to compete on global cybersecurity market. In 2018 the Union was a net importer of cybersecurity products and solutions and largely depending on non-European providers. The cybersecurity market is globally a 600 billion EUR market that is expected to grow in the next five years on average by approximately 17% in terms of sales, number of companies and employment.[1] However, the European ICT industry is falling behind in the global competition race. Sandwiched between the giants of the ICT industry in the US and China, Europe is struggling to keep up and is losing hold of its own digital sovereignty. Surprisingly, this is while the EU and EU Member States are among the most digitally developed world economies. [2]  Digital development should work for and not against the European market. Success requires risk. New business and regulatory frameworks need to be produced that anticipate the evolution of the market over the next 5 to 10 years and lay the groundwork for the success of the European ICT industry. In an increasingly inter-connected world, the European ICT sector should be strengthened and stimulated to improve its competitiveness in the global marketplace, as well as in the domestic marketplace. In this context, the ‘Vision for a stronger cybersecurity community going forward’ event aims to look at a number of topics including the regulation of the internet and social media specifically with speeches from Thomas Myrup Kristensen, Facebook's Managing Director of EU Affairs and Oscar Tapp Scotting, the UK Government’s Online Harms Deputy Director. Other speakers included Brian Honan from BH Consulting who spoke on threat intelligence, Jean-Pierre Quémard, President of Alliance pour la Confiance Numérique (ACN) on European competiveness and Gabi Dreo Rodosek from the CODE Research Institute at Universität der Bundeswehr München who expressed her concern for the lack of European market leaders in R&D. Finally, a panel discussed the regulatory agenda for the new European Commission and the newly elected European Parliament, which provided preliminary recommendations from the industry on future potential policy initiatives. ENISA, Executive Director, Udo Helmbrecht stated that “in an average European office, ICT software and hardware are generally built and developed in Asia and USA. Where Europe once led the world in the deployment of initially analogue and then mobile digital technology such as GSM, Europe is now debating the appropriateness of the supply of 5G technology from non-European suppliers. Traditional EU mobile handset manufacturers are struggling to compete with major Asian and US suppliers. We should emphasise to people European values such as trustworthiness and security of ICT products and services.” Background Since 2015, ENISA has been organising its Industry Events in an effort to stimulate the development of the EU network and information security (NIS) industry. The event aims to improve collaboration between ENISA and the private sector particularly SMEs. ENISA is celebrating its 15th anniversary and on 27 June 2019 its new and permanent mandate will enter into force. The new mandate includes a role for ENISA in certification but also that ENISA will actively support the European Commission and EU Member States in the development, implementation and review of cybersecurity policy. Therefore following the important changes in the European Parliament and European Commission, ENISA takes the opportunity to discuss the future of European cybersecurity with its industry stakeholders.

ENISA_PR_0227	2019-06-05	PR	Telecoms taken by storm: Natural phenomena dominate the outage picture 	" For the full report please visit: Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2018 In total the incident reports add up to 960 million user hours lost, i.e. an average of around 2 hours per subscriber per year.  User hours is a metric that is used to quantify the impact of an incident, by multiplying the number of subscribers affected and the duration of the incident. Natural phenomena are the dominant root cause, accounting for 480 million user hours, i.e. 50%. System failures are the most common root cause with 67% of the incidents, but for the first year natural phenomena account for more impact in user hours. System failures are often hardware failures and software bugs. Over the last few years there is a big increase in the overall impact of natural phenomena, and at the same time a drop in the impact of system failures. 15% of the incidents involved a power cut, but incidents caused by power cuts account for 496 million user hours lost, i.e. more than half of the total impact. Powergrid dependencies are increasingly important for the EU’s telecom sector. Many incidents follow the pattern of natural phenomena (storm, wildfire, etc), power grid outage, communication service outage. Across the EU authorities and providers are working to address this issue, ensuring continuity with backup power supplies, addressing weaknesses, and developing other contingency measures. Udo Helmbrecht, the Executive Director of ENISA, says: ""It has been 10 years since ENISA started working closely with the telecom sector and the telecom NRAs to implement the security requirements of the EU telecom legislation. The NIS directive, which came into effect in 2018, extends these security requirements to many other critical sectors. For ENISA however, the telecom sector remains an important focus area. The new European Electronic Communications code, the revision of the e-Privacy directive and the recent discussions around the deployment of 5G again show how critical this sector is for Europe."" CIRAS – Cyber Incident Reporting and Analysis System To support the incident reporting process ENISA developed CIRAS, a tool for reporting security incidents. An anonimized set of data is publicly available allowing visual and custom analysis, for specific services, assets, or root causes.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/for-telcos/visual-tool Multi annual trends in a nutshell Looking back at the last 7 years of annual incident reporting we see a few trends: The total number of reported incidents across the EU has stabilized at around 160 per year. The average size of incidents, in terms of impact, is dropping rapidly. This may be due to changes in network architecture and/or lower reporting thresholds. Overall impact of natural phenomena is trending up rapidly since 2016, while system failures are decreasing in size. For each root cause category the number of incidents is relatively stable: around 65% of incidents are system failures, 20% human errors, 10% natural phenomena, 5% malicious actions. ENISA steps up its efforts to support the EU Member States ENISA is closely working with European national regulatory authorities and experts from the private sector to prepare the ground for the upcoming changes generated by the European Electronic Communications Code EECC. At the same time, ENISA is identifying and exploiting synergies between the different pieces of EU legislation, addressing cross-cutting issues, cross-sector dependencies, and cross-border supervision. Background information In the EU, electronic communication providers have to notify significant security incidents to the National Regulatory authority (NRA) in their country. At the start of every calendar year the NRAs send a summary about these incidents to ENISA. This document, the Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2018, covers the incidents reported by NRAs for 2018 and gives an anonymised, aggregated EU-wide overview of telecom security incidents. Security breach reporting has been part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the 2009 reform of the telecom package: Article 13a of the Framework directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011. The breach reporting in Article 13a focuses on security incidents with significant impact on the operation of services, i.e. outages of the electronic communication networks and/or services. At the end of 2020 the new European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) comes into effect, extending the scope of breach reporting, to include also confidentiality breaches for instance, and extending services in scope, to include also (over the top) interpersonal communication services like Whatsapp and Skype. ENISA is currently working with the NRAs to prepare the ground for reporting and security supervision under the EECC. The Article 13a Expert Group was started by ENISA, under the auspices of the European Commission, back in 2010 with the goal of bringing together experts from NRAs from across the EU to agree on a practical and harmonized approach to the security supervision requirements in Article 13a and to agree on an efficient and effective incident reporting process. The group is now chaired by Warna Munzebrock, a representative of the Dutch Radiocommunications agency. The Article 13 expert group meets 3 times per year and its work and deliverables can be found at: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0228	2019-06-04	PR	Artificial Intelligence: an opportunity for cyber-crisis management in the EU	" The aims of the conference were twofold, firstly, it provided  a discussion forum for EU Organisations and Bodies which are the main stakeholders of the Blueprint proposal for a cyber crisis cooperation framework. Secondly, on day 2, experts on artificial intelligence from the private sector and academia discussed the uses and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in the context of cyber-crisis cooperation, such as how AI can support the response to large-scale cross-border cybersecurity incidents at the strategic and political levels. ENISA presented its work in a variety of sectors, including tools and opportunities that can support the work of the private sector and academia. One of these is the OpenCSAM, a tool being developed to support the blueprint, which facilitates the production of cybersecurity situation awareness reports. Researchers and players active in the domain discussed how to enhance the tool, for example by improving the natural language processing, feature extraction, summarisation, data scrapping, and training datasets. ENISA Head of Core Operations Department, Steve Purser said: ""ENISA recognises the enormous potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve many aspects of our everyday lives. At the same time, we see the need to develop an appropriate security framework for the different components that make up AI and to ensure that we secure the technologies themselves before we use AI to secure other things."" Background information The EU cyber-crisis management blueprint is a comprehensive collaboration mechanism that integrates the cyber element into the EU crisis management processes. The blueprint extends from the political to the technical level and includes EU bodies & institutions and the EU Member States through the NIS Cooperation Group and the CSIRTs network.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0229	2019-06-03	NEWS	ICANN CEO visits ENISA to discuss cybersecurity of the internet infrastructure	" ICANN is an international, non-governmental and non-profit organization which manages the internet's namespace, i.e. the internet domain names, the DNS root registries. ICANN coordinates the global IP address space by handing out blocks of IP addresses to regional internet registries, like RIPE NCC for Europe. ICANN also hosts the archive of IETS RFCs which define today's internet protocols.  Much of the work that ICANN does is closely related to cybersecurity. Among the topics of discussion were the big DNS hijacks which have been observed this year (also referred to as DNSpionage), the security issues of DNS in general, the issue of network slicing, elasticity of DNS for IoT, and the influence of EU companies and EU countries in international standards setting bodies like IETF and ITU. Steve Purser, head of ENISA's core operations department, said: ""ENISA acts as a cybersecurity hub, bringing together the right stakeholders and the right experts to develop a common approach to cybersecurity issues. We are looking forward to leverage ICANN's expertise on relevant cybersecurity issues, like the vulnerabilities in DNS. "" The EU's NIS Directive, adopted in 2016, which came into force in 2018, covers critical internet infrastructure like the European internet exchange points, top level domains and DNS. In the context of the NIS Cooperation Group, the NIS Directive's cooperation mechanism, ENISA is currently working with national authorities to develop an efficient approach to supervising of these critical parts of the EU's internet backbone.

ENISA_PR_0234	2019-05-17	PR	High time to protect the internet route map: Here are 7 basics	 Last year ENISA surveyed a range of large and small providers across the EU, confirming that BGP hijacks are an issue also in the EU: 44% of respondents said that the impact of BGP incidents is high, affecting large numbers of users and last for many hours, and 93%  say it needs an urgent fix. The Border Gateway Protocol, is like a dynamic internet route map, used by network operators to find the best route from one computer to another, across the globe.  But it is 25 years old and was not designed with security in mind. The good news is that there are remedies, but unfortunately not all network operators are implementing. What are recent cases? Back in 2008, an operator in Pakistan famously BGP hijacked all the world’s Youtube traffic, by accident. Here are three very recent examples of high-profile, high-impact cases: In 2018, Google traffic, from people in the west of the USA, was BPG hijacked to go via Russia, to China. Allegedly this was done intentionally and for espionage purposes. In 2017, internet traffic to 80 high profile websites (Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.) was BGP hijacked by a (previously dormant) Russian network. In 2018, Amazon cloud traffic from a number of Ethereum cryptocoin customers was BGP hijacked. The goal was to steal thousands of euros in cryptocurrency. Many BGP attacks do not make the news headlines. And there is the risk that attackers use BGP vulnerabilities not only for espionage or financial crime, but to completely disable internet connections, to disrupt society.  What are the risks? BGP attacks are used for different purposes, ranging from financial crime targeting a few users for stealing crypto coins, to large scale espionage and can even be used to cause crippling internet outages. Our dependency on the internet, increased usage, and an increase in the number and sophistication of cyberattacks, means that the risks of leaving BGP unsecured are very high. ENISA recommendations for BGP security Following up on the BGP security survey of 2018, ENISA discussed with experts in the telecom sector over the last months, to compile a shortlist of basic security measures: Monitoring and detection: Monitor the routes used by your internet traffic to detect anomalies, not only to guarantee resilience but also for the privacy and security of subscribers; Coordination: It is crucial to coordinate with peers, by publishing route policies and partaking in peering databases; Prefix filtering: It is important to filter prefixes that should never be announced or forwarded in your network, both on ingress and egress network traffic;  Path filtering: It is important to filter BGP AS path attributes for items that should not be allowed in BGP route announcements to into or out of your network;  Bogon Filtering: It is important to filter out bogus prefixes (also called bogons), as these prefixes should never appear in BGP announcements; Time-to-live security (GTSM): It is important to implement TTL security, which makes it harder attack BGP sessions;  Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI): It is important to implement RPKI and digitally sign route announcements to allow peers to check that announcements are authentic and authorized. These 7 steps are relatively simple and effective to shore up BGP. Electronic communications providers, but also all the other organizations who manage a so-called Autonomous System (which implements BGP) should as a minimum adopt and implement these 7 measures. For the full report: 7 Steps to shore up BGP Background information BGP is 25 years old and was not built with security in mind, i.e. it inherently trusts every network operator to have good intentions and not make mistakes. Every operator can simply announce it has a fast and short route. Naïve BGP implementations simply accept such announcements. BGP hijacks, both intentional and unintentional, have been happening for years. There are several industry efforts advocating for additional security (such as https://www.manrs.org/ and the recent proposal by RIPE). But implementation does not happen across the board and cyber attacks targeting BGP vulnerabilities continue to happen (see above for a few examples). This work on BGP security was done in the context of Article 13a of the Framework directive, which asks EU Member States to ensure that providers take appropriate security measures to protect their networks and services. In the last 10 years ENISA collaborated closely with the EU Member States and experts from national telecom regulatory authorities (NRAs) which supervise this part of the EU legislation, under the ENISA Article 13a Expert Group. The ENISA Article 13a Expert group, meets 3 times per year to discuss and exchange information about security in the electronic communications sector.

ENISA_NEWS_0237	2019-05-16	NEWS	Testing cooperation of EU CSIRTs Network during large-scale cyber-attacks	 The role of ENISA was twofold. On the one hand, the CSIRT Relations team actively participated as the secretariat of CNW, as defined by the NIS Directive. In this regard, ENISA provides overall support to CNW and manages tools for cooperation among all members. On the other hand, ENISA’s exercise team, which also organises the pan-European ‘Cyber Europe’ exercise, organised the exercise, including the definition of the scenario and injects, and controlled the execution. CSIRT teams from 27 countries, CERT-EU and ENISA played a scenario where cyber-attacks were performed over critical infrastructures before and during European elections. Several operators of essential services across different Member States were the ‘target’ of the attacks, and some incidents tried to diminish trust in the electoral process. Over 50 incident-handling experts from the EU Member States participated in this exercise. CyberSOPex2019 proved once more how fundamental in developing confidence and trust among Member States the CNW is, promoting swift and effective operational cooperation. The CyberSOPEx type of exercise is an important part of ENISA’s continuous efforts to improve the large-scale incident response collaboration of the CSIRTs Network members, by focusing on training participants on situational awareness, information sharing, understanding roles and procedures, and utilising CSIRTs Network-related tools just like in a real life situation.

ENISA_NEWS_0242	2019-04-16	NEWS	Behavioural aspects of cybersecurity 	 In summary, ENISA found a relatively small number of models, none of which were a particularly good fit for understanding, predicting or changing cybersecurity behaviour. Many ignored the context in which much cybersecurity behaviour occurs (i.e. the workplace), and the constraints and other demands on people’s time and resources that it causes. At the same time, there was evidence that models that stressed ways to enable appropriate cybersecurity behaviour were more effective and useful than those that sought to use threat awareness or punishment to urge users towards more secure behaviour. The report offers recommendations for specific groups such as policy makers, management and organizational leaders, CISO and security specialists, CSIRT / CERT community, software developers and awareness raising managers. ENISA proposes that practitioners can take significant steps towards helping employees to act in a more secure way. This may involve skills-based training and support but may also require the restructuring of security practices and policies, to better align with people’s workplace goals and/or capabilities. ENISA proposes a model of awareness, analysis and intervention for organisations to systematically plan and implement changes to address human aspects of cybersecurity. For policy makers, ENISA identified a clear lesson from the reviews - increasing cybersecurity literacy and skills is an evidenced method to support citizens to protect their cybersecurity. Management and organisational leadership need to shift their perspective on what their role and responsibilities are in managing cybersecurity in their organisations. They should decide which security risks they want to manage, and commit the resources required. CISOs and security specialists need to know the impact that security policies can have on staff in daily business operations. They need to be visible and approachable and even acquire the ‘soft skills’ to do this effectively, ideally through special programmes. Incident response teams and security operations centre staff should be enabled to perform in the fight against cyber threats. Their employers need to ensure sufficient staffing levels, invest in training and personal growth, and support innovative approaches such as team and multi-team. Last but not least, all people involved in cybersecurity should mainly aim to provide users with the skills in order to cope with cyber threats rather than running repetitive awareness campaigns on the scale and vulnerability of cybersecurity threats.

ENISA_PR_0243	2019-04-05	PR	EU Member States test their cybersecurity preparedness for fair and free 2019 EU elections 	 The objective of the exercise, which took place today in the European Parliament, was to test how effective EU Member States and the EU's response practices and crisis plans are. It also aimed to identify ways to prevent, detect and mitigate cybersecurity incidents that may affect the upcoming EU elections. This exercise is part of the measures being implemented by the European Union to ensure free and fair elections in May 2019. Vice-President of the European Commission, for the Digital Single Market Andrus Ansip said: ”We must protect our free and fair elections. This is the cornerstone of our democracy. To secure our democratic processes from manipulation or malicious cyber activities by private interests or third countries, the European Commission proposed in September 2018 a set of actions. Together with the EU Member States, and other EU Institutions we are implementing these actions. We also decided to test our cybersecurity vigilance and readiness towards secure, fair and free EU elections 2019 by organising the first in its kind EU exercise on elections. I believe that this is an important step forward for more resilient EU elections in a connected society.” Vice-President of the European Parliament Rainer Wieland said: ”Cyber-attacks are a recent but very real threat to the stability of the European Union and its Member States. A cyber-attack on elections could dramatically undermine the legitimacy of our institutions. The legitimacy of elections is based on the understanding that we can trust in their results. This very trust has come under pressure from cyber-attacks and other new types of election fraud in the Digital Age, and we must respond! With the upcoming European elections in 2019, we have to take responsibility and build up the necessary means to strengthen our electoral cyber security. This responsibility is a common one, shared by European and Member State institutions. Together we need to safeguard the integrity of the elections.” More than 80 representatives from EU Member States, together with observers from the European Parliament, the European Commission and the EU Agency for cybersecurity, participated in this first EU table-top exercise (with the code name EU ELEx19) on the resilience of the upcoming European Parliament elections. The main responsibility for protecting the integrity of the elections lies with the Member States, and the overall objective of the exercise was to test and further strengthen their preparedness - especially their election and cybersecurity authorities – in the face of hybrid cyber-enabled threats, and to assess their ability to swiftly develop and maintain situational awareness at national and EU level if a serious cybersecurity incident which could impact on the integrity of the 2019 EU elections were to occur. Based on various scenarios featuring cyber-enabled threats and incidents, the exercise allowed participants to: Acquire an overview of the level of resilience (in terms of policies adopted, available capabilities and skills) of election systems across the EU, including an assessment of the level of awareness among other stakeholders (e.g. political parties, electoral campaign organisations and suppliers of relevant IT equipment);  Enhance cooperation between relevant authorities at national level (including elections authorities and other relevant bodies and agencies, such as cybersecurity authorities, Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), the Data protections Authority (DPA), authorities dealing with disinformation issues, cybercrime units, etc.);  Verify EU Member States’ capacity to adequately assess the risks related to the cybersecurity of European elections, promptly develop situational awareness and co-ordinate communication to the public;  Test existing crisis management plans as well as relevant procedures to prevent, detect, manage and respond to cybersecurity attacks and hybrid threats, including disinformation campaigns;  Improve cross-border cooperation and strengthen the link with relevant cooperation groups at EU level (e.g. Election Cooperation Network, NIS Cooperation Group, CSIRTs Network) in order to improve the capacity to respond in a coordinated manner in the event of cross-border cybersecurity incidents;  Identify all other potential gaps as well as adequate risk mitigation measures which should be implemented ahead of the European Parliament elections.  Background On 12 September 2018 the European Commission announced a  set  of  concrete  measures to address potential threats to elections, including a recommendation of the European Commission on election cooperation networks, online transparency, fighting disinformation campaigns and protection against cybersecurity incidents. In line with this European Commission recommendation, a European Cooperation Network on elections has been established. This network has already met three times in Brussels to discuss necessary actions to address potential threats to the elections and thereby strengthen the resilience of the European Union's democratic systems. One of the actions that this network decided to pursue was the organisation of a table-top exercise to test EU's cybersecurity preparedness to ensure secure, free and fair EU elections 2019. Today's cybersecurity test also goes hand-in-hand with the Action Plan against disinformation that the European Union adopted last December to build up capabilities and strengthen cooperation between Member States and EU institutions to proactively address the threats posed by disinformation.

ENISA_PR_0246	2019-03-20	PR	ENISA: 15 years of building cybersecurity bridges together	 Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of the Agency, and distinguished guests representing the European Parliament, the European Commission, and the EU Member States delivered speeches, including a keynote speech from honorary guest, European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, Mariya Gabriel.Commissioner Gabriel said: “The security of citizens has always been one of the biggest priorities for the European Union. Since it was set up in 2004, ENISA has steadily worked to help reinforce the cybersecurity across the Union. Today, 15 years later, it is established as a strong and credible player in the European cybersecurity eco-system. And now a new chapter is starting, with the Cybersecurity Act giving ENISA a permanent mandate and new important tasks for the Digital Single Market, such as its future role in the European cybersecurity certification framework.”    Executive Director Helmbrecht: ”We are celebrating 15 years since ENISA has started working for the Member States, raising the level of cybersecurity in the European Union. During the last 10 years we have been working closely with all our stakeholders in order to transition ENISA from a ‘centre of excellence’ into the EU Cybersecurity Agency – an Agency which has significant new responsibilities and which is well positioned to support the Member States, private sector and other key stakeholders throughout the next decade. A key success factor in achieving this has been ENISA’s operating model of leveraging expertise in the Member States as a core part of all of its activities. This approach brings both scalability and a sense of ownership from the community and will continue to be the preferred way of working for the future. On a personal note, this is my last year as Executive Director of the Agency, which I joined 10 years ago. I would like to thank all of the ENISA colleagues who have contributed to this wonderful journey, as well as to all of our stakeholders.”The eminent speakers and guests discussed some of the most important topics on the current European cybersecurity agenda, for instance, the upcoming cyber-challenges and the role ENISA could play in tackling these. The main topics covered were the development of the Network and Information Security Directive and the recent adoption by the European Parliament of the Cybersecurity Act. The participants tackled the joint responsibility of government agencies, industry, and academia to address future cyber-challenges and discussed which cooperation models need to be explored.  The speakers also discussed certification, explaining how the EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework would serve as the key differentiator in Europe when compared to global players and how the EU cybersecurity certification schemes can be recognised on a global scale. Another topic explored was the area of the CSIRTs Network and the ‘Blueprint’, which will enable the EU Member States to better protect EU citizens, operators of essential services and critical infrastructures from cyber-attacks.  The key messages from the conference are:The conference was opened by ENISA Executive Director, Udo Helmbrecht who set the scene stating that Europe has the chance to lead and that on the political level there is a commitment to cybersecurity. The new European cybersecurity certification scheme will become an important opportunity for the European market.As the anniversary is an occasion to reflect on the future and the new permanent mandate of the Agency, Jean-Baptiste Demaison, the chair of the ENISA management board shared some of ENISA’s success stories. He stated that we need to scale up in the future as digitisation will change society, this could be done through technical excellence and through the added value that ENISA brings to Member States.Moderating The ‘Future Challenges’ panel, Steve Purser, Head of Core Operations at ENISA outlined three main challenges in cybersecurity; societal, economic and technological. The panellists reflected on the upcoming threats from their various perspectives. Wim Mijs from the European Banking Federation reflected on the importance of trust in the banking sector and hence the reliance on security. MEP Angelika Niebler, rapporteur of the European Cybersecurity Act called for a European approach to 5G technology. Khalil Rouhana, Deputy Director General of DG CONNECT stated that the growth of ENISA was inevitable and that resources should be put in place for the Agency. Thomas Rosteck, Division President of Infineon Technologies noted that from the private sector’s view, they see that the GDPR had an effect on non European companies and the GDPR according to him is one of the influences Europe can have on devices not made in Europe .Moderator Reinhard Posch, steered the discussion around awareness raising of certification. The certification panellists explored the opportunities of the new regulation, looking at possibilities and changes from a number of different views; the consumer, industry as well as the EU Member States. Representing BEUC, the European Consumer Organisation representative, Ursula Pachl urged that security by design should be an obligatory principle for consumer devices. Guillaume Poupard, Director General of ANSSI stated that “The European cybersecurity framework is a cornerstone to keep on building the European strategic autonomy, strengthening our common resiliency and securing the Digital Single Market. We must collectively use certification as a tool to enhance competitiveness and protect our citizens and industries. To that end, ENISA, 'the EU Agency for Cybersecurity', reinforced by its new mandate, will play a strategic role to coordinate all the relevant expertise when setting up a certification scheme.”Gerhard Schabhueser, Vice-President of the German Federal Office for Information Security explained that the Cybersecurity Act is a positive, additional instrument which enables the European market to be more transparent regarding cybersecurity certification and standardisation.Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, Mariya Gabriel congratulated ENISA for its 15th anniversary, recognising the hard work that ENISA has done throught the years and she looks forward to the future growth of the Agency. Her concluding remark is that “we are creating a new cybersecurity market place and the world is watching us.”The final panel ‘From Exercise to Blueprint’ was moderated by Heli Tiirmaa-Klaar, the Estonian Ambassador at Large for Cyber Diplomacy who shared the three layers of cyber crisis.  In terms of exercises and the blueprint, the panellists discussed the importance of cooperating. Saad Kadhi, the head of CERT-EU, a key player in the European Union’s cybersecurity ecosystem shared their operational expertise in order to foster additional cooperation across the community. Pawel Busiakiewicz from the Knowledge Hub for Migration and Security talked about the EU HEX-ML 18 (PACE) exercise that took place in November 2018 and commented that, while a lot has been achieved, more can be done to improve the responses at operational and strategic levels. Response must come from the experts, but threat actors are developing and becoming more advanced. The definition of standard operating procedures is still an important area. Despina Spanou, the Director for Digital Society, Trust and Cybersecurity at DG CONNECT said that in the blueprint, the European Commission has recognised that private entities also have a role to play and this is a culture of collaboration that has been set by the NIS directive. 	https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-15-years-of-building-cybersecurity-bridges-together
ENISA_NEWS_0247	2019-03-15	NEWS	Privacy standards for information security 	 Such integration is fundamental to protect personal identifiable information, particularly in digital environments and it may support the implementation of relevant privacy and data protection legislation. This ENISA study, explores how the standards-developing world has been responding to the fast-changing and demanding realm of privacy. This study provides insights into the state-of-the-art of privacy standards in the information security context by mapping existing standards available and standardisation initiatives alike. The main findings of this study include the following: There is an increasing need to analyse the mapping of international standards and European regulatory requirements, as references to standards in the EU legislation are becoming recurrent and there are considerable differences from jurisdictions outside of the EU; Proving compliance with privacy standards in information security is not as straightforward as expected. Some approaches for conformity assessment are available in specific sectors, others are still lacking appropriate mechanisms; A coherent analysis of sector-specific needs for privacy standardisation is essential, especially in the context of information security, before moving ahead with the adoption or development of new standards; Standardisation focuses mainly on covering technological approaches and solutions. Many such solutions address the introduction of privacy-preserving technologies throughout the whole lifecycle of a product or a system. The concept of privacy-by-design and its implementation are still not presented clearly, despite a general common agreement on perceived benefits.  ENISA complements this information with a range of additional recommendations, which aimed to support the prioritisation of potential areas of action for the near future: EU policy makers and European Standards Organisations should promote the development of European content and input to privacy and cybersecurity standards; EU policy makers and European Cybersecurity Certification Group members should promote the endorsement and adoption of privacy and information security standards, including conformity assessment standards specific to privacy; EU bodies and competent authorities in the Member States should promote the adoption of a structured approach on the analysis of sector-specific needs with regard to privacy standardisation, especially in information security context and then proceed with the adoption or development of new standards; EU policy makers and relevant EU bodies need to be further involved in the standardisation process, so as to define, endorse or affirm potential standardisation goals in the areas of privacy and information security; Competent bodies at EU and Member State level should further promote their research and standardisation activities to support the meaningful implementation of the ‘Privacy by Design’ principle.

ENISA_NEWS_0248	2019-03-14	NEWS	Security and privacy considerations in autonomous agents 	 Autonomous agents range from smartphones applications to autonomous robots supporting the supply chain in product development, for example; a key aspect in this regard is the data collected, mainly to support functionalities in a qualitative and timely manner. Depending on the level of autonomy and context of operations, security and privacy considerations may vary. This ENISA study outlines AI technology used in autonomous agents in various application domains. It discusses the main security and privacy considerations and delivers a set of recommendations for relevant stakeholders and policy makers. This study highlights relevant considerations, such as unauthorized autonomous systems, hijacking and misuse transparency and accountability, pervasiveness, retention and opacity of processing.  This study concludes with a set of recommendations, aimed at further influencing future EU policy initiatives, such as to: Further promote and support the adoption of security and ‘privacy by design’ principles as a pre-requisite during the inception, design and implementation of autonomous agents and systems; Develop a collaborative approach on the identification and the exchange of best practices. Gradually such initiatives should put forward sets of baseline security requirements; Endorse and support existing initiatives on the promotion and protection of human rights, through the establishment of appropriate ethical conditions related to autonomous agents;  Establish a relevant framework for policy development, emerging technologies and new application areas.

ENISA_PR_0253	2019-02-28	PR	ENISA makes recommendations on EU-wide election cybersecurity	 ENISA explores cyber-enabled threats, which have the potential to undermine the EU democratic process. Of particular significance is the possibility of interference in elections by cyber means, due to the widespread use of digital technology to support electoral processes in activities such as confidential communications of politicians and political parties, political campaigns, the electoral register, the counting of votes, and the dissemination of the results.Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA: “As some EU Member States have either postponed or discontinued the use of electronic voting, the risk associated with the voting process can be considered to be somewhat reduced. Nonetheless, the public political campaigning process is susceptible to cyber interference. We have witnessed in the past election campaigning processes being compromised due to data leaks. ENISA encourages the EU Member States and key stakeholders such as political parties to partake in more cyber exercises aimed at testing election cybersecurity in order to improve preparedness, understanding, and responding to possible election-related cyber threats and attack scenarios. These stakeholders should have incident response plans in place, in the event that they become a victim of data leaks.“An evolving threat is the motivation behind the actors interfering with the due process of elections by cyber means. The motivation for the actors can be manifold, for example for financial gain, fame and reputation, or to provoke chaos and anarchy, undermine trust in democracy, and subvert political opposition.Through this paper, ENISA puts forward a set of recommendations aimed at improving the cybersecurity of elections across the EU and supporting the Member States in their efforts.The most important recommendations that ENISA makes are: Member States should consider introducing national legislation to tackle the challenges associated with online disinformation while protecting to the maximum extent possible the fundamental rights of EU citizens; Member States should continue to actively work together with the aim to identify and take down botnets; Consideration should be given to regulation of Digital Service Providers, social media, online platforms and messaging service providers at an EU level to ensure a harmonised approach across the EU to tackling online disinformation aimed at undermining the democratic process; The above players are also advised to deploy technology that will identify unusual traffic patterns that could be associated with the spread of disinformation or cyberattacks on election processes; A legal obligation should be considered to classify election systems, processes and infrastructures as critical infrastructure so that the necessary cybersecurity measures are put in place; A legal obligation should be put in place requiring political organisations to deploy a high level of cybersecurity in their systems, processes and infrastructures; Official channels/technologies for the dissemination of the results should be identified, as well as back-up channels/technologies that validate the results with the count centres. Where websites are being used, DDoS mitigation techniques should be in place.

The report is a synthesis of findings based on evaluation and performance information gathered by collecting feedback and open source information. The report targets both organisations that supported ECSM and those seeking to get involved in the future. At the same time, it also targets ICT and non-ICT security professionals who wish to launch similar awareness raising campaigns. Furthermore, the report is directed at EU and national policy makers who aim to improve the security awareness of citizens, professionals and IT end-users in general. According to the report, more Member States got involved or increased their participation in the campaign. The number of activities organised under the ECSM umbrella increased by 6.5%, from 532 in 2017 to 567 in 2018. Additionally, over 160 teachers from 22 countries took part in online events destined for students. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA: ""The latest edition of the ECSM brought many opportunities for people to discover how to stay safe online and play an active role in cybersecurity, in particular the young generations. I am happy to see that the number of participants increased considerably. Europeans understand more and more that a safe online environment can only be built by a common effort. I encourage everyone to join the ECSM in 2019."" The 2018 ECSM campaign was the sixth consecutive edition and was supported by the European Commission, Europol’s Cyber Crime Centre (EC3), European Schoolnet, SaferInternet4EU campaign and cybersecurity organisations from the Member States. The campaign sought to raise awareness of cybersecurity practices through a plethora of activities such as  specialised reports, conferences, workshops, seminars, online courses, trainings, strategy summits, general presentations to users, online quizzes, etc. The four themes chosen in 2018 were: Week 1 – Theme 1: Practice basic cyber hygiene. ENISA and the Anti-Phishing Working Group APWG designed a phishing poster for the first week of the campaign. The phishing poster provided information about the scale of the phishing problem by numbers, tips on how to avoid phishing and what to do if one becomes a victim of phishing.  Week 2 – Theme 2: Expand your Digital Skills and Education. ECSM learning modules were created for the campaign in collaboration with European Schoolnet, as part of the #SaferInternet4EU campaign launched on Safer Internet Day 2018 by Commissioner Mariya Gabriel to promote online safety, media literacy and cyber hygiene. Week 3 – Theme 3: Recognise Cyberscams. Europol and the European Banking Federation launched an awareness campaign on the 7 most common online financial scams. Law enforcement agencies from all 28 EU Member States, 5 non- EU Member States, 24 national banking associations and banks and many other cybercrime fighters raised awareness about this criminal phenomenon.  Week 4 – Theme 4: Emerging Technologies and Privacy. This included a live webinar by ENISA experts and external experts from Industry with the purpose of discussing the importance of having an “Emerging Technologies Horizon Scanning and Research Process”.

ENISA_NEWS_0259	2019-02-07	NEWS	"What is ""state of the art"" in IT security?"	" In many European countries, national legislators are pursuing the objective of reducing the deficiencies in IT security. In addition, the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) with its high requirements for technical and organisational measures has been in force since 25 May 2018. Both legal sources are demanding that IT security be brought up to the level of ""state of the art"", but do not say what should be understood by this in detail. In Germany, TeleTrusT - IT Security Association Germany has written guidelines that are published in English in cooperation with the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA).Daily reports on security incidents in companies and authorities show that there is an urgent need for action to improve IT security. Article 32 of the GDPR regulates ""security of processing"" to ensure that, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, appropriate technical and organisational measures are implemented. This provision is aimed at ensuring a level of protection appropriate to the risk.The document published on the ""state of the art"" in IT security provides concrete advice and recommendations for action. These guidelines are intended to provide companies, providers (manufacturers, service providers) alike with assistance in determining the ""state of the art"" within the meaning of the IT security legislation. The document can serve as a reference for contractual agreements, procurement procedures or the classification of security measures implemented. They are not a replacement for technical, organisational or legal advice or assessment in individual cases.The document will support companies in all EU countries in identifying the required level of security in the field of IT security.Dr. Udo Helmbrecht, ENISA Executive Director: ""ENISA continues its work in supporting the EU Member States by contributing to this handbook. The articles are designed to provide concrete information and recommendations on how to improve IT security. This booklet should be a useful guide to IT practitioners who have the responsibility for complying with legislation.""TeleTrusT Chairman Prof. Dr. Norbert Pohlmann: ""By determining the state of the art, we will be able to adequately increase the level of IT security, strengthen our robustness against cyber attacks and thus significantly reduce the risk of ongoing digitalisation.""TeleTrusT Board Member Karsten U. Bartels: ""The consideration of the state of the art is a technical, organisational and legal task for companies and authorities. The guidelines help very specifically at these three levels - both in the operative implementation and in the documentation.""English version: https://www.teletrust.de/en/publikationen/broschueren/state-of-the-art-in-it-security/ German version: https://www.teletrust.de/publikationen/broschueren/stand-der-technik/ ENISA - European Union Agency for Network and Information SecurityThe European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) is a centre of expertise for cyber security in Europe.

ENISA_NEWS_0260	2019-02-06	NEWS	CSIRTs and incident response capabilities in Europe	 The study focuses on providing insights on whether cooperation between different players, particularly CSIRTs, is spontaneous or driven by regulation. The prospective vision of the analysis tries to identify the key evolutions in the CSIRT-IRC landscape within a 5-year timeframe.For the purpose of this study, ENISA specialists mapped both newly emerging and already-existing CSIRTs, investigating their policies across and outside of Europe. In this process, NIS experts identified and analysed 81 new CSIRTs, as well as a corpus of 36 policy, regulatory and strategic documents relating to the development of cyber incident-response capabilities.The main findings of the study are: The implementation of the NIS Directive fosters the adoption of a holistic approach towards IR and an upward alignment of national capabilities; The NIS Directive may have a positive effect at the international level and provides the EU with a status of ‘norm setter’; IR capability development of national administration and operators of essential services emphasizes the relevance of collaboration at national and European level; Successful cooperation initiatives in the field of Incident Response Capabilities at an international level are driven by public-private partnerships; There is an important development of IR services in the European private sector; however, new vulnerabilities tend to target the hardware layer of devices manufactured outside of Europe; Acknowledging their exposure to cyber risks, military players tend to follow the same dynamics as the civilian sector when developing their IR capabilities. CSIRTs play a vital role in cyber resilience in a context of increasing dependency on digital infrastructures. They perform an important function throughout the crisis management process, from identifying security incidents, protecting organisations against attacks, disseminating information on threats and recovering from incidents. ENISA has a European CSIRT inventory on its public website, which provides an overview of the current situation concerning CSIRT teams in Europe. This inventory provides a list of publicly listed incident response teams that can be visualised via an interactive mapping tool.

ENISA_NEWS_0262	2019-02-01	NEWS	ENISA and FORTH met to boost collaboration and pave the way for joint cybersecurity projects in Crete 	" The two teams together with ENISA’s Executive Director, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht and the Chairman of the Board of Directors at FORTH, Prof. Nektarios Tavernarakis, exchanged information on cybersecurity projects and discussed ways to boost their collaboration following the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in September 2018. Prof. Udo Helmbrecht said: “FORTH has a special place in the history of ENISA. It was our first home in Greece, and together we have been accomplishing many great projects for over 15 years now. Our joint work and dedication have established Heraklion as a European centre of cybersecurity excellence. We are honoured to be partners and friends in making Greece and Europe cyber safe. ” Prof. Tavernarakis said: ""FORTH keenly fosters and encourages close collaboration between ENISA and Research Teams at FORTH. We are proud to collaborate with ENISA, as this cooperation provides ample opportunity for scientific interactions and fruitful collaborations between the 2 Organisations. Specifically, the Institute of Computer Science of FORTH is actively pursuing research in the area of network and information security, offering considerable potential for synergies. As another example, FORTH, with 2 of its Institutes, the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology and the Institute of Computer Science, is the coordinator of one of the four national Precision Medicine Centers, that has been established here in Crete. Operating such a center poses unique challenges, relevant to sensitive data processing and storage. Other areas of potential collaboration are the graduate programmes in Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering which FORTH is coorganising together with the University of Crete."". The meeting was the first of a series of steps that will help extend the cooperation between ENISA and FORTH, to the following activities in the area of cybersecurity: Jointly organised cybersecurity conferences and the NIS summer school; Cooperation in the areas of Life Sciences and Computer Science; Jointly organised exercises and training sessions by maintaining/sharing common knowledge and by exploiting available facilities and human resources in the new ENISA premises; Jointly organised research activities touching upon areas of common interest. ENISA and FORTH are expected to drive many of the key projects outlined above from ENISA’s new building in Heraklion. ENISA’s new state-of-the-art building in Heraklion, offering conference facilities and suitable IT infrastructure, has been accommodating ENISA’s staff based in Heraklion since December 2018. Its formal inauguration is expected this spring, with the participation of representatives from the Greek Government, Local Authorities and FORTH. Background                                                                                                  In order to enhance the cooperation between ENISA and FORTH and help establish Heraklion as a European centre of cybersecurity excellence, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by both parties on 24 September 2018.

ENISA_PR_0263	2019-01-31	PR	Your must-have IoT security checklist: ENISA’s online tool for IoT and Smart Infrastructures Security	 The tool, available at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/iot-tool , will help users save time when identifying threats and prioritising security areas of importance. The tool provides a combined view of the security good practices that ENISA has been developing for the last years to secure IoT, Industry 4.0 and Smart Infrastructures, such as smart cars, smart airports, smart hospitals, and smart cities. The information provided through this tool for each thematic area reflects the information comprised in corresponding ENISA reports that have been released in the past. The tool allows drawing comparisons between different IoT sectors, since the same ENISA threat taxonomy has been used when defining security measures. When implementing IoT, each parameter or filter of the tool addresses the following issues: What are the threat groups from which you want to protect your organisation? What are the security domains you want to cover? What security measures categories are you looking for? Which security standards and best practices would you like to take into account when securing IoT in your organisation? On the main webpage, the users of this tool can select the thematic area of interest and then identify the pertinent threats, standards or security measures. The tool accepts one or multiple search criteria to generate results that are most relevant to the users’ needs. Users can navigate through the list to find the Security Measures they seek, according to specific filters, such as Security Measures Category, Security Domains, Threat Groups or even Specific Standards. Additionally, the tool offers the option of either printing or exporting search results for further use. For example, the CISO of a company wants to make sure the new deployment is secure and covers all the baseline requirements regarding software and firmware updates. The CISO accesses the ENISA IoT Baseline Security Recommendations tool and selects the item referring to ‘Software and Firmware updates’ from the ‘Security measure’ column. The tool returns all baseline recommendations pertinent to this search, as identified in the ENISA report. Now, the CISO is aware of the baseline configurations for this issue (software / firmware updates) on IoT devices of interest.

ENISA_PR_0264	2019-01-30	PR	ENISA publishes training course material on network forensics for cybersecurity specialists	 Based on current best practices, the training includes performance indicators and means that will help those who take it increase their operational skills of tackling cyber-incidents. Network forensics is more important than ever, since more and more data is sent via networks and the internet. When there is a security incident, network forensics can help reduce the time needed to go from Detection to Containment – an essential step in any major security incident. When used proactively, network forensics provides a better picture of what your network’s ‘normal’ traffic looks like, leading to more intelligent alerting and less false positives. ENISA makes available a ready-to-use version, including manuals for trainers and students, and provides tools and data related to exercise scenarios through Virtual Machines. The training consists mainly of exercises focused on logging and monitoring, detection, and analysis or data interpretation. For example, one exercise deals with an attack on an ICS/SCADA environment in the energy sector. It starts with the preparation phase and it is followed by the incident analysis and post-incident activity. Other scenarios within the training refer to how to detect “exfiltration” in a large finance corporation environment, or the analysis of an airport third-party VPN connection compromise. One of ENISA’s main priorities is to deliver high-quality capacity-building material and activities for the EU Member States’ CSIRTs, to manage cybersecurity threats and incidents efficiently. Within this area, ENISA provides guidance on key elements of network and information security, in line with the current technologies and methodologies. In February 2018, ENISA launched a project aimed at updating the content of the already existing CSIRT training material produced since 2008, in the area of network forensics. For the full training material visit: Introduction to Network Forensics Note for editors ICS/SCADA are industrial control systems that make all sorts of equipment and even complete energy and chemical plants reachable and controllable via the network. Exfiltration is data theft, followed by sending the data out to an outside collector – a significant risk for companies, which can lead to lawsuits, high financial sanctions, reputation damage or the disclosure of company secrets or strategic documents. According to the NIS Directive, CSIRTs – Computer Security Incident Response Teams – are specialised national authorities in the EU Member States responsible for monitoring incidents at national level, providing early warning, alerts and information to relevant stakeholders about risks and incidents, responding to incidents, providing dynamic risk, incident analysis, and increasing situational awareness.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0267	2019-01-28	PR	Hope is stronger than fear: ENISA celebrates the European Data Protection Day	 On this occasion, ENISA shares some of its work in the fields of shaping technology according to GDPR provisions and security of personal data processing. An overview of data pseudonymisation ENISA today publishes a new report, which discusses the notion of pseudonymisation and its role under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To this end, specific techniques that may be utilised for pseudonymisation are presented together with relevant best practices, with a focus on the area of mobile applications. Exploring the notion of data protection by default The principle of “data protection first”, as promoted by GDPR when it comes to data protection by default, has neither been the standard behaviour of products, services and applications nor a regular principle in software design methods. This report aims to shed some light on what the data-protection-by-default principle means in information technology design, what is the situation today, as well as how this new obligation could support controllers in selecting data-protection-friendly defaults. Sketching the notion of “state-of-the-art” for security of personal data processing Under GDPR, security of personal data is one of the main elements of controllers’ accountability. As such, it requires an engineered approach capable of striking a balance between security goals, costs and “state-of-the-art” solutions. To this end, ENISA, following past years’ work on the security of personal data processing for SMEs, publishes a new report, which discusses well-established security practices in a number of categories of security measures. The reports are available here: Recommendations on shaping technology according to GDPR provisions - An overview on data pseudonymisation Recommendations on shaping technology according to GDPR provisions - Exploring the notion of data protection by default Reinforcing trust and security in the area of electronic communications and online services   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0268	2019-01-28	PR	Exposure to cyber-attacks in the EU remains high - New ENISA Threat Landscape report analyses the latest cyber threats	 Advances in defence have also been assessed: law enforcement authorities, governments and vendors were able to further develop active defence practices such as threat agent profiling and the combination of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and traditional intelligence. This led to a more efficient identification of attack practices and malicious artefacts, leading in turn to more efficient defence techniques and attribution rates. “We are witnessing the development and deployment of new technologies, which are reshaping the cyber landscape and significantly impacting society and national security. The European Union needs to be ready to adapt to and reap the benefits of these technologies to reduce the cyber-attack surface. This report raises awareness of the cyber dangers that citizens and businesses should be conscious of and responsive to. It provides recommendations as to how the digital single market can prepare an adequate response to cyber threats, with certification and standardisation at the forefront”, said ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht. The report highlights some of the main trends relating to cyber threats in 2018: Mail and phishing messages have become the primary malware infection vector; Crypto-miners have become an important monetisation vector for cyber-criminals; State-sponsored agents increasingly target banks by using attack-vectors utilised in cyber-crime; The emergence of IoT environments will remain a concern due to missing protection mechanisms in low-end IoT devices and services. The need for generic IoT protection architectures/good practices remains a pressing issue; Cyber threat intelligence needs to respond to increasingly automated attacks through novel approaches to the use of automated tools and skills. Skills and training are the main focus of defenders. Public organisations struggle with staff retention due to strong competition with industry in attracting cybersecurity talents. ENISA addresses these conclusions by making the following recommendations: Policy: The EU should develop capabilities to address CTI knowledge management. EU Member States should take measures to increase their independence from currently available CTI sources (mostly from outside the EU) and to enhance the quality of CTI by adding a European context; EU governments and public administrations should share “baseline CTI”, covering sectorial and low-maturity needs of organisations; The collection of CTI should be made easier. Coordinated efforts among EU Member States are key in the implementation of proper defence strategies. Business: Businesses need to work towards making CTI available to stakeholders, focusing on the ones that lack technical knowledge; The security software industry needs to research and develop solutions using automation and knowledge engineering, helping end-users and organisations mitigating most of the low-end automated cyber threats, with minimum human intervention; Businesses need to take into account emerging supply chain threats and risks and bridge the gap in security knowledge among the services operated and end-users of the service. Technical – research – education: The ingestion of CTI knowledge needs to be enlarged to include accurate information on incidents and information from related disciplines; CTI knowledge management needs to be the subject of standardisation efforts, in particular: standard vocabularies, standard attack repositories, automated information collection methods, and knowledge management processes; Research needs to be conducted to better understand attack practices, malware evolution, malicious infrastructure evolution and threat agent profiling.

Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA stated that ""ENISA is honoured to organise this pioneering conference on Transport Cybersecurity with our partners DG MOVE and the relevant EU Agencies. It paves the way for a joint collaboration with DG MOVE and fosters cooperation to progress the policy for cybersecurity in the transport sector across the EU borders, protecting and safeguarding the security of the end-users and its digital ecosystem. ENISA will continue to drive its efforts established in the NIS Directive in the air, rail, road and maritime transport sector."" The Conference hosted a series of interesting presentations and discussion panels, during which several topics were discussed that could enhance collaboration between the sectors’ operators: the welcome session and panel focused on collaboration between the Transport Agencies, ENISA and the European Commission by setting a common portfolio. DG CNCT presented the Cybersecurity Act, stressing the importance of collaboration with Transport stakeholders under the topic of certification. The demanding regulatory framework was next in the agenda and ENISA moderated a session comprised by public and private representatives of the sectors, touching upon the need for a common framework. DG MOVE moderated the next session on lessons learnt from cybersecurity incidents, which actually showed that the sectors share indeed many commonalities. Finally, the need for intra-sector and inter-sector collaboration was highlighted in the last session, where the ISAC model was one of the topics discussed. This conference paved the way for a fruitful collaboration between agencies as well as operators. The key outcomes of the conference are underlined in the Joint statement, which is available at https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/2019-01-23-1st-transport-cyber-security-conference-conclusions.pdf.

ENISA_NEWS_0271	2019-01-17	NEWS	Forest for the trees: an IoT security standards gap analysis	 An ENISA analysis, which maps the existing standards against requirements on security and privacy in the area of the Internet of Things (IoT) yields that there is no significant standards gap - every requirement can be met by an existing standard. While standards exist for many different elements of making a device or service secure, when referring to IoT, one refers to an ecosystem of not only devices and services. Moreover, the context of use of IoT, its high scalability and other features further call for flexible approaches. The gap in IoT device standards for security is that the standards are not treated holistically. Therefore, it is possible to introduce to the market a device that can authenticate its user, can encrypt and decrypt data transmitted and received, can deliver or verify the proof of integrity, but which will still is and remains unsecure.The study pinpoints potential areas of improvement and additional efforts in securing the IoT area. Special attention has been paid to the EU needs related to the European cybersecurity certification framework. In the very case of security, a large number of processes as well as technical standards have to be in place, to ensure that any device placed on the market is assuredly secure. As the standards alone are essential, but not sufficient to ensure open access to markets, the study also proposes an approach towards certification, assurance and validation schemes to identify what is sufficient. This study concludes that in general there is an identifiable gap in process, by which a vendor can assert that their IoT product or service is secure. There is no significant gap, however, in standards to introduce secure IoT devices to the market. The process recommended in this report is intended in part to engender a change in attitude towards device security, by making secure IoT the only form of IoT that reaches the market; also, to give confidence to the market through a mix of certification, assurance testing and validation, as well as market surveillance.

ENISA_NEWS_0272	2019-01-15	NEWS	Acceptance of eIDAS audits: Global or local?	 The eIDAS Regulation sets up a framework to grant qualified status to an array of trust services (e.g. electronic signatures, seals etc.) aiming to enhance consumer trust in the digital environment. Qualified trust services undergo regular assessments by accredited bodies, overseen by national and EU authorities for the purpose of meeting requirements laid out in the eIDAS framework. Taking the view point of a global audience, ENISA has published a new report to address aspects of conformity assessment in an effort to improve the global acceptance of eIDAS audits. Towards this goal, the report recommends to: adopt a harmonised conformity assessment approach in the EU and promote it at the international level promote and reference specific standards on the auditing of TSPs and conformity assessment The report also carries out a review of concurring international auditing schemes for qualified TSPs and the accreditation of the respective CABs. Strategies largely based on improving existing European standards are also proposed for the purpose of fostering cooperation with browser vendors and thus improve better acceptance of eIDAS audits.

ENISA_NEWS_0273	2019-01-09	NEWS	Supporting the Fight Against Cybercrime: ENISA report on CSIRTs and Law Enforcement Cooperation 	 This cooperation is incomplete however, unless the judiciary is equally brought into the picture due to the pre-eminent role it plays across the MS in directing criminal investigations. While collecting evidence is important warranting its admissibility in a criminal trial is equally so. Admissibility of evidence relies on compliance with certain technical and legal requirements as well as the conditions laid down in criminal procedure. In 2018, ENISA confirmed that CSIRTs, law enforcement and the judiciary have complementary roles and structure and that incident handling varies across Member States. The data CSIRTs and Law Enforcement Agencies have access to varies, and it affects information sharing between them when they seek to respond to cybercrime. CSIRTs interact frequently with the Law Enforcement Agencies rather than with the prosecutor. CSIRTs offer support to Law Enforcement Agencies to collect and analyse different types of evidence. CSIRTs are called rarely as witness in courts but the material they collect during the incident handling might be used to decide on cybercrime cases.  Cooperation challenges concern data retention, the sharing of personal data (including IP addresses) and the confidentiality around criminal investigations as well as evidential admissibility of digital evidence. Legal challenges are followed by cultural, technical and organisational ones. ENISA recommendations include: Gather further knowledge and study interactions across the three communities; Analyse the legal and policy framework shaping this cooperation; Seek to better understand tools and methods used for the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the judiciary and improve via training opportunities.

ENISA_NEWS_0275	2018-12-20	NEWS	EU improves its capacity to tackle cyber crises: Cyber Europe 2018 after-action report 	 ENISA has compiled all the information gathered during the exercise and produced an after-action report and a closure video, identifying challenges and main takeaways, and making useful recommendations for the participants. The main conclusion drawn is that the EU-level cooperation has improved considerably over the last years, becoming more mature and effective. Cyber Europe 2018 proved that the European Union is well equipped to respond to cyber crises. To this extent, the technical challenges of the exercise provided an excellent opportunity for the cybersecurity teams to enhance their capabilities and expertise in dealing with a variety of challenges. The operational capacity and technical skills of all participants were at the highest level. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, commented: “Cyber Europe 2018 highlighted the importance of cooperation between national authorities, security providers, and potential victims of a cyber-attack. It proved once again that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and extreme incidents can be tackled best only by information exchange and collaboration. All participants did a great job in following business processes, agreements, communication protocols, and regulations to mitigate effectively the situations presented to them. ENISA values very much these capacity-building exercises, and will continue to provide such services for the EU Member States, especially in light of the new mandate of the agency.” The key findings and recommendations include: The report reveals that EU Member States have improved their cooperation at technical level. The CSIRTs Network can easily address minor issues related to cooperation structures and tools, mainly by organising regular cyber-exercises, trainings and communication checks; In addition, the key actors will define and test the procedures and tools that are necessary for the implementation of the framework on coordinated response to large-scale cyber crises, also known as ‘Blueprint’ (1); At national level, the cybersecurity authorities should develop procedures and tools for a coordinated response, including structured cooperation and information exchange between private and public institutions. After the establishment of such procedures, the responsible actors should test them regularly by organising cyber exercises; One major issue is the shortage of IT security specialists. The private sector should set IT security as a priority and invest in resources and expertise, especially the operators for essential services, such as aviation, energy, finance, healthcare, maritime, and transport; Public and private organisations must ensure that they have crisis communication protocols in place and that personnel in sensitive positions are aware of these protocols. Organised by ENISA in collaboration with cybersecurity authorities and agencies from all over Europe, Cyber Europe 2018 focused on the aviation sector and enabled the European cybersecurity community to strengthen their capabilities in identifying and tackling large-scale threats, as well as to provide a better understanding of cross-border incident contagion. ENISA orchestrated the two-day exercise at its headquarters in Athens, bringing together over 900 European cybersecurity specialists from 30 countries (2). They had to deal with over 23 200 injects throughout the exercise, depicting cyber-attacks at major European airports, takeovers of official communication channels, disinformation in the media and social media and many other issues. About Cyber Europe exercises ‘Cyber Europe’ exercises are simulations of large-scale cybersecurity incidents that escalate to EU-wide cyber crises. The exercises offer opportunities to analyse advanced cybersecurity incidents, and to deal with complex business continuity and crisis management situations. ENISA has already organised four pan-European cyber exercises in 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016. International cooperation between all participating organisations is inherent to the gameplay, with most European countries participating. It is a flexible learning experience: from a single analyst to an entire organisation, opt-in and opt-out scenarios, the participants can customise the exercise to their needs.

ENISA_NEWS_0277	2018-12-18	NEWS	New chair of the Article 19 Expert Group on security of e-Trust services	 Electronic trust services is what we call services like digital signatures, digital certificates, electronic seals, timestamps, etc. used in electronic transactions, to make them secure, trustworthy. The eIDAS regulation, which came into force in 2016, provides the EU wide legal framework for both trust services and national eID schemes. Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation sets the security requirements for trust service providers. The Article 19 Expert Group was set up by ENISA in 2015, under the auspices of the Commission, to support voluntary collaboration between Member States about the technical details of how to implement Article 19. This is a voluntary non-binding process, between experts from ministries, agencies, supervisory bodies, national authorities, et cetera, who are involved with the implementation of Article 19. The group has experts from EU member states as well as EEA and EFTA countries. The Article 19 Expert Group meets twice a year. At the last meeting in October in Malta, hosted by the Maltese Communications Authority, the group agreed to a new terms of reference for the group, formalizing a new modus operandi. At this meeting a new chair was elected, Ulrich Latzenhofer from the Austrian Regulatory Authority for Broadcasting and Telecommunications, will chair the group for the next 2 years. ENISA will continue to support the group in the role of secretariat.

ENISA_NEWS_0278	2018-12-14	NEWS	Assessment of Standards related to eIDAS	 While CID (EU) 2016/650 lays down standards for the security assessment of QSCDs at the time of drafting it there were no available standards for signing devices yet; consequently, a Trust Services Provider (TSP) managing signature creation data on behalf of the user was unable to support the creation of Qualified Electronic Signature and seals. In a broader context, standards for remote signing devices have yet to be developed too. There are two important use cases relating to the identified gap, namely: trust service providers managing signature creation data on behalf of the user to support the creation of qualified electronic signature and seals  trust service providers creating qualified electronic signature and seals on their own behalf. In this report, ENISA presents aspects of QSCD certification and QTSP supervision to identify the way to combine respective elements therein, in line with the eIDAS requirements. In this context, this report seeks to support standards CEN EN 419 241‐2 and CEN EN 419 221‐5:2018 so that they could be referenced in an amended version of CID (EU) 2016/650.  This report suggests that there is shared responsibility between the TSP managing the QSCD to work with appropriate TSP issuing certificates and on the issuing TSP to work with an appropriate TSP to manage the QSCD. Competent supervisory bodies retain of course their function to verify that such requirements are followed in qualified devices management and qualified certificates issuance.  As a certain amount of coordination across stakeholders is required to achieve a global trust level, it would be pertinent to provide a way to advertise the elements of supervision. Besides the official compilation of Member States notification on secure signature creation devices (SSCDs) and QSCDs, the trusted list of the country where QTSP operates might provide an indication on the way a QSCD is managed. Alternatively, the list of notified SSCDs and QSCDs compiled by the European Commission might also be used for this purpose. Market stakeholders would benefit from further developments in this regard.  Read the full report here: Assessment of Standards related to eIDAS Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0279	2018-12-14	PR	The economics of vulnerability disclosure 	 In addition, the report addresses economic factors, incentives and motivations that influence the behaviour of the different vulnerability disclosure actors, as well as two case studies of recently disclosed high-profile vulnerabilities that illustrate how the process occurs. The full report can be accessed here. The analysis presented in this report will be useful to all the key stakeholders involved or affected to some extent by a vulnerability disclosure in a software or hardware component or system, including researchers, consumers, vendors, vulnerability coordinators and brokers, regulators, managers, information security experts and officers. The report builds upon the ’ENISA good practice guide on vulnerability disclosure’ published in 2016. The Executive Director of ENISA Udo Helmbrecht commented: “Economics is a key driver of modern security and economic considerations often determine the decision of approaches to be taken when resolving issues. This report perfectly illustrates this fact and provides valuable insight into why different actors behave as they do in the vulnerability disclosure space.” Vulnerability disclosure refers to the process of identifying, reporting and patching weaknesses of software, hardware or service that can be exploited. The different actors within a vulnerability disclosure process are subject to a range of economic considerations and incentives that may influence their behaviour. These economic aspects of vulnerability disclosure are often overlooked and poorly understood, but may help explain why some vulnerabilities are disclosed responsibly while others are not.    Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0280	2018-12-12	PR	ENISA produces guidelines for assessing security measures in the context of net neutrality 	" According to the EU’s net neutrality regulation, called the Open Internet Regulation, which came into force in 2016, internet providers should treat all internet traffic to and from their customers equally. Security measures, like blocking traffic on certain ports, are only allowed under specific circumstances. One of these circumstances refers to the application of security measures that are necessary to protect the integrity or security of networks, services using the networks, or end-user equipment.  The power to assess whether or not security measures are justified lies with the national telecoms regulatory authorities (NRAs). The application of a security measure to an internet network can be deemed justified by taking into consideration the circumstances, the type of networks, the services provided, etc.  Within this context, ENISA developed a guideline to support NRAs in their assessment. The guideline is available here and includes:  a list of evaluation factors for assessing whether a security measure is justified or not;  an evaluation checklist for NRAs;  a justification form, which can be used by NRAs to collect information about a security measure from providers. The justification form can also be used by providers, as part of their internal processes to document which security measures they consider to fall under this exception to the net neutrality rules. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA commented: ""ENISA's role in the EU cybersecurity landscape is often that of a catalyst for collaboration, a hub for exchanging views and opinions. For this paper, we worked closely together with two very different communities: the people supervising security in the telecom sector, and the people supervising the EU's net-neutrality rules. Although these two groups have a very different perspective, the collaboration was actually very useful and fruitful. We are happy with the practical results: a checklist and an evaluation form. "" On the same topic, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) publishes an “Opinion for the evaluation of the application of Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 and the BEREC Net Neutrality Guidelines”. Through this document, BEREC shares its knowledge in the area, based on its experience with the application of the ‘Open Internet’ regulation and its ‘Net Neutrality Guidelines’ to the European Commission. BEREC concluded that the application of both regulation and guidelines is working well. Both documents could be considered as striking a balance between the views of many different stakeholders. Johannes Gungl, Chair of BEREC commented: “Secure networks are crucial. However, on the one hand a given measure can provide security to end-users, on the other hand it could impair end-users’ rights. These are the rights to access and distribute information and content, or to use and provide applications and services. Therefore, we are very happy to have been able to contribute to the ENISA guidelines with our expertise on the Open Internet Regulation.” This guideline was developed together with experts from ENISA Article 13a Expert Group, which focuses on security in the telecom sector. Input from experts Of BEREC’s Net Neutrality Expert Working Group was also used. ENISA prepared these guidelines building upon feedback from providers across the EU.  For the full report: Guideline on assessing security measures in the context of Article 3(3) of the Open Internet regulation Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0283	2018-12-07	NEWS	More than 100 experts attend the joint NSA-ENISA Cybersecurity workshop in Bratislava	 The workshop featured a diverse set of over 100 participants from 15 countries from academia, research, finance, energy, European Commission, JRC, etc. 2018 is the year the NIS Directive gets implemented across the EU. Most countries have already transposed the NISD in their national laws and many countries are now in the process of fine-tuning and adapting their national laws and national setup to best fit their setting. This joint NSA-ENISA workshop had a focus on critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP) and the NIS Directive. Ratislav Janota, director of the SK-CERT, said: “Cybersecurity is a national issue and the protection of critical sectors requires a partnership with the operators of essential services. For us it is a priority to engage with industry early and often. Not only to get the right laws and supervisory mechanisms in place, but also to ensure that we take the right practical steps to improve security. This joint NSA-ENISA workshop offered a great platform for discussions and engagement. “ Evangelos Ouzounis, Head of ENISA's Secure Infrastructures and Services Unit, said: “Slovakia is one of the front-runners when it comes to implementing the NIS Directive. For us, it is a useful learning experience to speak and engage with the national CSIRTs, the national authority, and the sector here in Slovakia, about how the cybersecurity framework is developing and what the challenges are. We look forward to organising more regional workshops in other parts of Europe, to better engage with industry and local players.“ The workshop was opened with welcoming words and a keynote from the Director of the NSA Office, Blažej Lippay, pointing out the importance of cooperation in the dealing with cybersecurity incidents. Evangelos Ouzounis welcomed the participants on behalf of ENISA and gave a keynote address giving an overview of ENISA's work in the area of critical information infrastructure protection and the NIS Directive. Jan Adamovský, Chief Security Officer from the Slovak Sporiteľňa, gave a presentation about cybersecurity challenges in digital banking, urging better cooperation between public and private sectors. Massimo Rocca from Enel Security and chairman of the European Energy ISAC (EE-ISAC) spoke in his keynote about the importance of sharing information based on mutual trust and the need for the energy sector to address threats and vulnerabilities pro-actively. There were two break-out sessions with more in-depth technical discussions. One break-out session, led by Marnix Dekker, ENISA, focussed on national supervision and incident response: - Camilla Lundahl, head of IT security at Avanza, a Swedish bank, spoke about how to work with ethical (white-hat) hackers and how to leverage their skills; - Fernando J.

ENISA_NEWS_0285	2018-11-30	NEWS	Good practices for identifying and assessing cybersecurity interdependencies 	 Yet, despite the clear need to address interdependencies as part of their overall cybersecurity risk management, organisations and National Competent Authorities (NCA) face difficulties due to the lack of suitable methods, tools, available data and expertise. In this context, ENISA publishes today a report aiming to support OES, DSP and NCA in identifying and assessing interdependencies effectively. The report has the following objectives: to provide a description of interdependencies among OES and DSP; to highlight risk assessment practices for the evaluation of the potential impact of interdependencies; to propose a framework for assessing interdependencies; and to define good practices for assessing interdependencies. Effective analysis of emerging dependencies and interdependencies will also support decision-makers in defining mitigation measures, thus enhancing the security of network and information systems. In order for OES, DSP and NCA to effectively identify and assess interdependencies, a framework based on a four-phase approach appears to be a suitable way forward. Existing methods, tools and good practices for interdependencies can be mapped easily on to these four phases, based on the respective individual or sectorial specificities and needs. The development of indicators for the interdependencies' assessment (which are mapped on to well known and widely used industry standards and frameworks) would also constitute a practical approach. In addition to this framework, this report identifies the main challenges that OES, DSP and NCA face in identifying and assessing interdependencies, and proposes a set of practical recommendations to support the relevant risk assessment.

ENISA_NEWS_0286	2018-11-29	NEWS	ENISA releases online NIS Directive tool showing per sector the national authorities for operators of essential services and digital service providers	 The NIS Directive tool is intended as a one-stop shop for experts from the industry linking to relevant ENISA work, national cybersecurity strategies, the CSIRT network, and the NIS Cooperation group website. This year all EU member states are implementing the NIS directive in their countries. The NIS Directive is the first piece of EU-wide cybersecurity legislation, proposed by the European Commission as part of the EU Cybersecurity strategy. EU directives give EU member states flexibility to take into account national circumstances, for example to re-use existing organizational structures or to integrate with existing national legislation. That also means that the authorities and laws are different from country to country and from sector to sector. Every country designates different supervisory authorities. For the industry and cybersecurity experts, it is important to know the relevant national authorities and laws under the NIS Directive in their subsector. This online tool takes you directly to the supervising authorities in each sector. The tool, being sector-specific, complements the European Commission's online map showing the transposition status per EU member state. ENISA will update this tool following the developments in the EU Member States.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0288	2018-11-28	NEWS	Information Security Audit and Self – Assessment Frameworks for operators of essential services and digital service providers 	 The report presents the steps of an information security audit process for OES, as well as of a self-assessment / management framework for DSP, as means to assess security and/or compliance with the security requirements set by the NIS Directive. The key outcome of the study is a set of good practices for audits and/or self-assessments aligned to NISD security requirements.  One of the NIS Directive key objectives is to introduce appropriate security measures for OES, as well as for DSP, in an effort to achieve a baseline, a common level of information security in networks and information systems. NCA will assess the compliance of OES with their obligations stemming from article 14 of the NIS Directive. For the DSP, there is no requirement for a compliance assessment; however, the member states should ensure that they take appropriate security measures. Information security audits and self–assessment / management exercises are the two major enablers to achieve these objectives. More specifically, the report: proposes steps to facilitate the audit process. The same steps are useful for the self-assessment; proposes an indicative list of questions for NCA, which, together with relevant evidence, could facilitate NIS Directive compliance assessments of OES; proposes an indicative list of questions, which, together with relevant evidence, could facilitate DSP’s self-assessment exercises against the security requirements of NIS Directive article 16(1); presents post-audit actions for the NCA, with a view to extract benefit and/or knowledge, following an information security audit exercise; and analyses leading audit and self-assessment / management frameworks, providing a mapping of those frameworks per domain of applicability i.e. in DSP, OES business environments or both. ENISA considers this report as an integral part of its work towards a better collaboration among Member States on cyber security. In this light, the report raises awareness of the most important challenges that stakeholders will face under the spectrum of the NIS Directive requirements.  For the full report: Guidelines on assessing DSP security and OES compliance with the NISD security requirements Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0289	2018-11-21	NEWS	ENISA is prepared to work closely with the stakeholders community on the proposed new Cybersecurity Certification Framework	 This conference, which attracted an impressive line-up of experts from both the public and private sector, was a follow-up on the European Commission's proposal for a European cybersecurity certification framework under the Cybersecurity Act (CSA) Proposal and the previous ENISA conference organized on March 1st 2018 in Brussels. Steve Purser, Head of the Core Operations Department at ENISA gave an initial welcoming speech in which he stressed the fact that ENISA has been preparing for its newly acquired role on the new Cybersecurity Certification Framework and will start work in earnest as soon as the CSA is adopted. On this note, he pointed out that the Agency would soon be publishing vacancy notices for key staff experts in this new area. He mentioned that the preparatory work with the stakeholder communities to prepare them for contributing to the first schemes has been very successful and ENISA believe that the majority of these communities are also up-to-speed and prepared to contribute. The ability of ENISA to understand the cybersecurity certification ecosystem has been singled out as the key takeaway message from this conference. Public authorities involved are already preparing for the transition to the new framework in an effort to encapsulate important European experience in the area of information security certification to the new EU cybersecurity certification framework. Significant vertical areas likely to benefit from the new framework include Cloud Computing and IoT as the European Commission is responding to apparent industry demand. While there is plenty of work ahead for the industry, CABs and public authorities, an air of optimism prevailed in the end of the conference about the ability of the EU to reign technology challenges by means of the certification framework.   Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director for the Agency closed the meeting by noting that the proposed Cybersecurity Certification Framework is a unique opportunity for the EU and assuring all present that ENISA was fully up to speed with its preparations and was ‘ready to go’. In this sense, ENISA is looking forward to the conclusion of the legislative process on the Cyber Security Act, which will provide the ‘green light’ that the Agency requires in order to assist in the scope of the framework.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0290	2018-11-19	PR	Cybersecurity is a key enabler for Industry 4.0 adoption  	 The fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) is closely associated with the topic of cybersecurity. A rapidly increasing number of Industry 4.0 cybersecurity incidents emerge, additionally stressing the need to strengthen cyber resilience. This is particularly true for industrial operators who are beginning to utilise the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 solutions. The need to improve cybersecurity of Industry 4.0 is even more important, since the potential impact of relevant threats ranges from compromising physical security to production downtimes, spoilage of products to damaging equipment as well as ensuing financial and reputational losses. The guidelines and security measures listed in this study by ENISA aim at improving the cybersecurity posture of Industry 4.0 organisations that have adopted or plan to adopt industrial IoT devices and solutions that enhance automation in industrial operations. These security measures apply to a wide audience, spanning from industrial IoT operators to manufacturers/vendors, which can utilise these measures and recommendations as a checklist to examine their security setup regarding their Industry 4.0 solutions. Steve Purser, head of Core Operations Department at ENISA, said: “The advanced digitalisation envisaged within the Industry 4.0 framework is a paradigm shift in the way industries operate and blurs the boundaries between the physical and digital world. With a great impact on citizens’ safety, security and privacy due to its cyber-physical nature, the security challenges concerning Industry 4.0 and IoT are significant. Today, ENISA publishes the study that addresses those challenges and, combined with the baseline IoT security work, lies the foundations for a secure industrial IoT ecosystem. IoT, together with Industry 4.0 cybersecurity, are the springboard for a safer and more resilient connected world.” The study makes a series of contributions. Most notably, it defines relevant terminology (i.e. terms such as Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing, industrial IoT),  categorises the Industry 4.0 assets in a comprehensive taxonomy across the manufacturing process and value chain, introduces a detailed Industry 4.0 threat taxonomy based on related risks and attack scenarios, and lists security measures related to the use of IoT in smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0 and maps them against the threats and affected assets. Additionally, the study presents existing security initiatives, standards and schemes. ENISA reviewed more than 150 resources on Industry 4.0 and IoT security and mapped them against the security measures proposed in this study. As a result, interested readers, who are nowadays facing a fragmented information landscape, will get a better overview resulting in a common basis of understanding. The agency considered the security of Industry 4.0 devices and services throughout their whole lifecycle (from conception to end-of-life and decommissioning) and took into account the requirements that are specific for an Industry 4.0 environment. The study lists 110 security measures across 20 different security domains, spanning from security and privacy by design to third-party and vulnerability management and access control and monitoring.  With this study, ENISA aims at setting the scene for Industry 4.0 and industrial IoT cybersecurity across the European Union to promote necessary collaborations and raise awareness of relevant threats and risks, with a focus on “security for safety”.

ENISA_NEWS_0291	2018-11-15	NEWS	Telecom security in the EU: ENISA hosts a productive 26th meeting of Article 13a Expert Group 	 More than 30 experts from telecom regulators and supervisory authorities of 19 EU and EFTA countries, the European Commission and ENISA, discussed cross-cutting telecom security issues. Highlights of the workshop include ENISA’s presentation of the new visual analysis tool, which allows stakeholders to analyse the incident reports of the last several years. In addition, the Hungarian NRA gave an overview and a demo of possible tools for proactive detection of outages; the Dutch Telecom Authority led a working discussion on outage caused by power cuts, looking in detail at scenarios and measures. Moreover, the Maltese Telecom Authority initiated a work stream to develop a common, EU wide, model for deriving national incident reporting thresholds, with a view to the upcoming new European Electronic Communications Code (EECC). Finally, the European Commission updated the group on the status of EECC, which is due to be adopted before the end of the year, while ENISA presented the results of two deep-dive analysis into BGP security and 5G slicing security. This series of meetings, held three times per year, gives experts from across the EU the opportunity to discuss telecom security issues and their supervision activities. An important goal of this expert group is to exchange experience and ideas, to support a harmonised approach across the EU’s telecom sector. Background information The upcoming new EECC aims to align the security requirements in the EU telecom regulation with the NIS directive, and to extend the scope of EU telecom regulation. It provides the basis for a strong partnership and collaboration between different stakeholders across the EU i.e. authorities implementing the NIS Directive, telecom regulatory authorities, and the private sector. This partnership will be important to address new and emerging challenges in the EU’s telecom landscape, like the deployment of IoT and the rollout of 5G technology. The Article 13a Expert Group was set up almost 10 years ago by ENISA, under the auspices of the European Commission, to agree on a harmonised implementation of Article 13a of the Telecom Framework Directive. This expert group discusses about how to implement security incident reporting (nationally and across the EU) and how to supervise security measures in the telecom sector. The group also exchanges experiences and lessons learned about major incidents affecting electronic communications networks and services. The work of the Article 13a Expert Group is explained in a short video. The new visual analysis tool, showing 6 years of telecom security incidents, is available here.

ENISA_PR_0292	2018-11-15	PR	Cybersecurity – The Right Medicine for the eHealth Sector	 The conference, which was hosted by the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, had around 100 participants and over 20 speakers and panellists. It tackled various topics related to cybersecurity in the healthcare sector. From regulatory aspects, such as the implementation of the NIS Directive by the EU member states, to the regulations regarding GDRP and medical devices, and the intricacies of cybersecurity incidents in healthcare technologies, the conference offered interesting information to everyone within the area of eHealth – be it policy, operations, manufacturing or information security topics. The Executive Director of ENISA, Udo Helmbrecht, said: “Based on our studies, currently, there is a low level of cybersecurity in the healthcare sector. Some hospitals do not have a Chief Information Security Officer, and there is a general lack of security policies and access control mechanisms. We need to do our utmost to protect critical healthcare systems, in particular hospitals, and work towards improving the safety of the patients. ENISA has allocated increased resources in the last years to help EU member states identify and overcome threats. The agency has produced several studies, reports and guidelines on how to improve the cybersecurity level of the eHealth ecosystem. In addition, it has become a tradition to bring together operators of essential services for the ‘eHealth Security Conference’. I want to thank the Dutch authorities for their invaluable support in organising the event this year.” The first session focused on the regulatory framework with healthcare organisations in scope, and mainly covered the following topics: the implications of the NIS Directive for hospitals and the added value it brought to the whole ecosystem; good practices on how to enable the implementation of GDPR across a state-wide healthcare system; facilitating healthcare providers from the regulators’ perspective; the challenges faced by the industry due to the new requirements of their customers. The discussions revealed that the primary goal across the sector should be harmonisation. During the second session, discussions moved to the topic of medical devices’ cybersecurity, and speakers and panellists covered the different perspectives of the whole ecosystem and shared their views on the following topics: the cybersecurity challenges regarding medical devices are increasing, as they become increasingly interconnected, difficult to patch and directly tied to cyber-physical security; the Medical Devices Regulation, and how it changes the landscape of cybersecurity of medical devices; good practices on how national competent authorities can introduce cybersecurity guidelines for manufacturers of medical devices; how the development of standards is guiding the industry towards more cybersecurity practices. A third session of the conference focused on cybersecurity incidents regarding healthcare technologies, and on how vendors integrate such incidents in their product lifecycle management processes. The Dutch HealthCERT shared their experiences with incident handling for hospitals in their country. In addition, DutchSec presented a live demo of an incident in hospital systems as an illustrative example. The conference ended with the mutual conclusion that the healthcare sector is particularly vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents and that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility: all stakeholders have to work together to increase safety for the patients. ENISA will continue its work on supporting to increase cybersecurity in eHealth over the next years. The agency will focus on the priorities of the sector, such as supporting the implementation of the NIS Directive and the overall development of the regulatory framework and publishing good practices for healthcare organisations as a guideline.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0297	2018-10-25	PR	If your toothbrush calls you, it might not be for dental hygiene: the importance of securing the Internet of Things	 Our world is hyper-connected now. Current estimates are that there are around 10 billion electronic devices with access to the internet and that number will have at least doubled by 2020. In addition to the many advantages and opportunities, the emerging ability of connected devices to impact the physical world has also created a new set of vulnerabilities and possibilities of exploitation by criminals. To address these vulnerabilities, tackle them effectively and to fully realise the great potential that it offers, ENISA and Europol have brought together 400 experts from the private sector, security community, law enforcement, the European Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) community and academia for a two-day conference in The Hague. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a wide and diverse ecosystem where interconnected devices and services collect, exchange and process data in order to adapt dynamically to a context, automate decisions and provide better situation awareness. In simpler words, it makes our televisions, bathroom scales, fridges and even our cars and cities ‘smart’ and creates new opportunities for the way we work, interact and communicate, and how devices react and adapt to us. IoT has added to our overall convenience, ease of use and even safety but it is important to implement adequate security measures to protect the IoT from cyber threats. What will happen when cheap and unprotected IoT devices allow criminals to watch your every move from your vacuum cleaner’s camera, change the settings of your connected medical device or drive your car into a wall? These challenges – whether technical, legal, policy or regulatory – need to be addressed across different sectors and stakeholders. For the second year in a row, ENISA and Europol joined forces to gather the world’s leading experts from the private sector and law enforcement and cybersecurity community to discuss the security challenges around Industry 4.0, IoT application domains and concrete case studies in the automotive, aerospace and smart home industry and emerging IoT trends like artificial intelligence and digital forensics. The second IoT Security Conference provides a unique platform for experts to provide the audience with insights into the security requirements of IoT, a mapping of relevant threats, assessing possible attacks and identifying potential good practices and security measures to apply in order to protect IoT systems and to deliver the many opportunities IoT offers in a safe and privacy-respecting manner. The main conclusions of the conference are: security should not be an afterthought when designing systems and IoT systems are no exception; implementing security does not need to be complicated. As ENISA's report shows, baseline security recommendations for IoT were made accessible via an interactive online table. This allows for easy access to specific good practices; law enforcement needs to be in a position to go beyond defence and incident response by being able to investigate and prosecute the criminals abusing connected devices; there is a need to discuss digital forensics in regard to IoT and the importance of data and privacy protection, considering the amount and different categories of data collected by the IoT; this joint conference is an excellent example of much-needed multi-disciplinary dialogues. ENISA and Europol are working closely together to inform key stakeholders of the need to be aware of the cybersecurity and criminal aspects associated with deploying and using these devices; the IoT has great potential and provides tremendous opportunities to improve the way we interact, do business and go about our daily lives. In 2019 and beyond, holistic, pragmatic, practical and economically viable security solutions need to be promoted and the entire IoT ecosystem needs to be looked into. ENISA will be working on an automotive IoT case study and welcomes the active support of all partners. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. Stronger collaborations with industry are planned together with other initiatives to ensure coordinated efforts and explore all possible synergies. ENISA’s Head of Core Operations Department, Steve Purser commented: “It is important and essential to collaborate because cybersecurity is a shared responsibility and that is ever truer in the IoT domain. This joint conference is an excellent example of these much-needed multi-disciplinary dialogues. The benefits and opportunities that IoT brings are numerous and of paramount significance for the entire society. It is our duty to ensure that this is done in a secure, safe and reliable manner. IoT security is a prerequisite for a secure and safe connected digital society. The time to act for Internet of Things security is now. I welcome the collaboration with Europol, and I am confident that such joint efforts will contribute to ensuring IoT security for all.” Europol’s Deputy Executive Director of Operations, Wil van Gemert added: “Law enforcement must have the tools, skills and expertise to investigate the criminal abuse of the IoT. We have a leading role, together with our partners, to go beyond increasing cyber security and resilience of the IoT as we can make a specific contribution in terms of deterrence. The complexity of IoT and its resulting cybersecurity challenges call for a holistic, smart and agile approach. As IoT is now a present reality as opposed to a futuristic concept, the necessity to have this multi-stakeholder conference to put cybersecurity at the heart of the IoT ecosystem is self-evident.” Common understanding of IoT cyber security ENISA has been working for several years on identifying security threats and risks in the Internet of Things and on providing recommendations to strengthen its security. To address the challenges and lay the foundation for IoT security, ENISA has introduced Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT, to ensure common understanding and interoperability when it comes to IoT cyber security. Device manufacturers and users of IoT devices and systems can use these recommendations as a checklist against which to assess their IoT security solutions. For this reason, an interactive online tool has also been developed that can be used to define one's own threat model and accordingly identify specific security measures to deter, protect and prevent pertinent threats. Building on this work, ENISA continues to engage with stakeholders and will publish a new study in 2018 on Good Practices for Security of IoT with a focus on Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, while in 2019 relevant efforts concerning smart cars are expected. Useful tool for law enforcement use The Internet of Things has many advantages for law enforcement as a new tool to fight crime. Police are already using connected devices like smart cameras for major events and to fight robberies and home burglaries, bodycams to raise situational awareness, sensors in firearms to track when and how often it is used, and so on. It is important that law enforcement also invest in the safety and security of its IoT-connected devices, to protect the privacy of the citizens it works for. Crime scenes are changing because of the IoT: data from connected doorbells, cameras, thermostats, fridges, etc. can provide useful and crucial evidence. The necessary forensic techniques and training will need to be used to safeguard this data. Big data collected by IoT devices, for example for facial recognition from camera images after a major incident, will become an integral part of a criminal investigation but also require the necessary means to protect the privacy of citizens.

ENISA_PR_0302	2018-10-08	PR	ENISA publishes annual report on trust services security incidents 2017	 The Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2017 is available here. Main findings: Almost half of the security incidents had impact across borders Half of the security incidents reported were severe (level 4 or 5 on a scale of 1 to 5) E-signatures and e-seals were the most affected services Most common root causes are system failures and third party failures (both at 36%) The EU regulation eIDAS, for trust services, like digital signatures, ensures there is a single EU market of secure and interoperable electronic trust services. eIDAS was adopted in 2015 and came into force in 2016. Under eIDAS trust service providers (TSPs) have to notify significant security breaches to national supervisory bodies in their country. 2017 was the first full year of security incident reporting. This ENISA report provides an aggregated EU-wide overview of security incidents. The main root causes of these incidents: 36% were system failures and another 36% third party failures. Only 7% of the breaches were malicious actions. Steve Purser, ENISA’s Head of Core Operations Department noted:  “This report clearly shows the significance of security incidents having a cross-border dimension and underlines the fact that cross-border collaboration is absolutely key when it comes to supervising trust services across the EU.” Background information Since 2015, ENISA has been supporting the EU countries on breach reporting, mainly by developing guidelines and tools for authorities and setting the incident-reporting framework for the implementation of the article 19 of eIDAS.   In 2015, ENISA formed the ‘Article 19’ expert group, under the auspices of the European Commission. This group is the platform for a voluntary and informal collaboration between experts of EU supervisory bodies, the group aims to discuss and agree on technical details of the implementation of eIDAS’s Article 19.  According to Article 19 of eIDAS, electronic trust service providers in the EU have to notify the national supervisory bodies in their country about security incidents. Annually, the supervisory bodies send summaries of these incident reports to ENISA. Subsequently, ENISA publishes an aggregated overview of these security incidents. As mentioned, 2017 marked the first whole year of reporting. Over the years, ENISA has developed numerous guidelines and good practices to support the public and private sector with security issues related to electronic IDs and electronic trust services.

ENISA_PR_0303	2018-10-05	PR	Get Cyber Skilled!	" ‘Get cyber skilled’ is a campaign that aims to support the advancement of cybersecurity education and skills to the next generation. European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society Mariya Gabriel said: “Advancing cybersecurity skills and education of younger generations is important for keeping themselves and others safe. Just like the physical world, there are threats online that could pose a danger to children and young adults physically, emotionally and financially. Building cybersecurity skills and competences helps the younger generation to develop routine cyber hygiene practices, which they can then transfer to others and help protect society.” ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht said: “Cybersecurity is a cutting edge and fast paced field that is also about human behaviour and helping others. Nurturing cybersecurity skills helps individuals to defend themselves online enabling them to become more resilient, self-reliant and confident: all strong positive character traits for a young inspiring future generation. Together with the European Commission, we are running this campaign to support parents, teachers, guardians, role models and community leaders with developing cybersecurity education and skills in young people."" The European Schoolnet Digital Citizenship Programme Manager Hans Martens said: “European Schoolnet is delighted to be involved in the ‘Get Cyber Skilled’ campaign as an aspect of European Cyber Security Month. Online security is increasingly seen as an important component of online safety, and our collaboration with ENISA on this learning event for teachers, delivered through the eTwinning platform, allows us to further disseminate the expertise developed within the Insafe network. By skilling educators on topics such as effective password security, privacy and good data management principles - and supporting them to deliver key messages in the classroom - we can in turn encourage children and young people to develop good cyber hygiene practices to draw upon throughout their lives, helping to protect both themselves and others online.” For this campaign, learning modules were created with European Schoolnet as part of the #SaferInternet4EU initiative launched earlier this year by Commissioner Mariya Gabriel. This initiative stems from the Digital Education Action Plan Priority – developing relevant digital skills and competences for the digital transformation. The modules are to be shared with teachers across Europe, who tailored them accordingly to create a study plan for their classes. Topics include password management, backing up data, privacy settings, and protecting against social engineering. ECSM is the European Union’s annual awareness raising campaign dedicated to promoting cybersecurity among citizens and organizations, providing up-to-date security information through education and sharing of best practices.

ENISA_NEWS_0304	2018-09-29	NEWS	Cross recognition of national eID schemes in the EU: one-step forward	 Notification to the Commission is essential to ensure cross-recognition. The goal is to spearhead the use of cross border services in a range of relevant areas, like for instance, in banking, eGovernment, health care etc. These application areas can all benefit from the cross border use of eIDs issued in the country of residence of an EU MS citizen while being used to consume services across borders. Implicitly, the advent of notified eID systems is also likely to mitigate some cybercrime threats especially those related to age limits to access particular services and protect vulnerable types of internet users such as underage persons. In an effort to render the Digital Single Market (DSM) meaningful, the upcoming transition marks a waypoint to better services in the internal market for business and citizens alike. As technical compatibility across various eID systems is key, the Commission has been working hard on a set of principles and guidelines on eID interoperability. ENISA is looking forward to the likely new competence in the policy area of eID as it stems from the draft Cybersecurity Act that is currently under legislative scrutiny. This new competence will complement the role that ENISA has assumed in the area of Trust services. ENISA has been active to support the implementation of eIDAS in Trust services in a uniform manner across the MS by providing technical guidance on standards and trust services in the EU, including the reports on annual security incidents under Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation. ENISA also seeks to stimulate discussion by means of an annual conference Trust service forum, the 4th edition of which is due in Berlin on 23 October 2018.  Additionally, particular tenets of the set of principles and guidelines on eID interoperability, point to areas such as security by design and security measures for the protection of personal data (art 32. of the GDPR), that have been part and parcel of the work of ENISA in the past few years. The ENISA Executive Director Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, underscored that […] “much like it has done throughout its 14-year long lifespan, ENISA is prepared to make available its advice and support to the EU MS and the Commission alike in the compelling policy area of eID”.

This is a matter of concern for the wide variety of actors which the ECSM campaign targets, ranging from security professionals to citizens”. European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society Mariya Gabriel said: “Cybersecurity is a challenge as well as an opportunity for Europe. The stronger we become in preventing and resisting cyber threats, the better for the competitiveness of our businesses and the security of our citizens. The European Cybersecurity Month really underlines that everybody has a responsibility to contribute to a secure Digital Single Market”. ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht said: ""Global ransomware damage costs are predicted to exceed $11.5 billion annually by 2019, the human attack surface is expected to reach 6 billion people by 2022, and yet the number of unfilled cybersecurity jobs are expected to triple, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. The making of a perfect storm. ECSM is here to thwart these trends by raising awareness of cybersecurity threats and providing solutions to organisations and citizens.""

ENISA_NEWS_0308	2018-09-17	NEWS	Towards secure convergence of Cloud and IoT	 In the last few years, we have witnessed a burst of Internet of Things (IoT) products and Cloud has evolved to accommodate the needs of IoT applications, providing many new features specific to aggregating, storing and processing data generated by IoT. This work combines the existing knowledge of ENISA in IoT and Cloud security and presents an analysis of security challenges and potential security takeaways that vendors of IoT devices and Cloud Service Providers can consider. Among the security takeaways, end-to-end security and adoption of baseline security measures are the ones confirming the need for a holistic approach on security for the IoT ecosystem. ENISA’s work on Baseline security recommendations for IoT introduced an IoT high-level reference model, which encompasses key elements that promote a significant degree of interoperability across different assets, platforms and environments for IoT. The ENISA IoT high-level reference model formed the basis for this work to divide the challenges and takeaways in three main dimensions: analysis, connectivity and integration.   The paper includes also four attack scenarios, which highlight how these security challenges can be materialised, and concludes mapping the challenges to the security takeaways.

ENISA_PR_0311	2018-08-31	PR	169 telecom incidents reported, extreme weather major factor	 The full report can be consulted at: Annual report Telecom security incidents 2017 169 incidents were reported by national telecom regulatory authorities in 2017 (NRAs) System failures dominate: 62% of incidents are system failures, mainly hardware failures and software bugs Major increase of extreme weather as a cause: 17% of incidents caused by natural phenomena Power cuts hurt telecom services: 22% of incidents are due to power outages Almost a fifth of the reported incidents (17%) were caused by natural phenomena, such as heavy snow, ice, storms and wildfires. This is significantly higher than the previous 3 years, when natural phenomena accounted for only 5% of the incidents. Natural phenomena will continue to be a concern for telecom providers across the EU, with extreme weather becoming more common due to climate change. 62% of the telecom security incidents in 2017 were system failures, such as hardware failures, software bugs or faulty software updates. In all years prior to reporting, system failures accounted for 60% to 80% of total incidents. More than half of the incidents reported have an impact on mobile telephony and internet in the EU. This confirms the shift of the last years. Fixed telephony was the most affected service only in the early years of reporting. With 22% of incidents due to power cuts, dependency of telecoms on the power grid is clear. A common scenario starts with a storm or wildfire which causes a power cut, and leads to a mobile network outage soon after. Only a small 2% of the incidents were due to malicious actions, such as denial of service attacks and cable theft. The year before, this was at 5%. The multi-annual trend for malicious actions has been below 10%. The document gives an aggregated overview of the annual summary reports sent to ENISA by the NRAs of the 28 EU Member States, Norway and Switzerland. There are clear trends emerging from the report. While the number of incidents reported has steadily increased over the years, from 76 in 2012 to 169 in 2017, the size of the incidents has gotten smaller on average. This is due to a combination of telecom providers reporting smaller incidents and NRAs using lower breach reporting thresholds. Udo Helmbrecht, Director of ENISA, says: “Security breach reporting is a hallmark of EU cybersecurity legislation. Breach reporting is important for national regulators and for policy makers, because it reveals information about the actual number of security incidents, their impact, and trends. ENISA looks forward to the adoption of the new European code for electronic communications, which broadens the scope of supervision and is necessary in the context of a fast-changing landscape of electronic communications.” Root cause categories of incidents 2012-2017 Combining data from the annual reports going back to 2012, we can see multi-annual trends. The trend graph below shows the root cause categories of incidents over the years (percentages). The ‘third party failures’ category is used as a flag on top of the other four root cause categories. Scatter plot of incidents (duration and number of users) 2012-2017 Combining the data from annual reports going back to 2012 (more than 700 incidents), we can see the duration (hours) and number of customers impacted. The scatter plot below shows the distribution of all years combined. Background information Since 2010, ENISA has been supporting the EU countries with breach reporting, developing guidelines and tools for authorities, setting workable thresholds. ENISA is part of the ‘Article 13a’ expert group on security measures and incident reporting, which aims to have a harmonized implementation, a level playing field across the EU, when it comes to telecom security. This simplifies compliance and reduces overhead for EU telecom providers. ENISA also analyses cross-cutting issues, common root causes and trends, collaborating with NRAs and the private sector. For example, in 2018 ENISA published an ‘EU state-of-play’ report on legacy interconnection protocols like SS7, an old protocol that can easily be exploited for illegal surveillance and interception. In 2016, ENISA surveyed telecom providers across the board to map out which security measures they had put in place. In 2014, ENISA published recommendations for providers on how to address security requirements when dealing with ICT equipment vendors and suppliers of outsourced services for core operations, because issues with ICT equipment were a major cause of reported outages. In 2013, when it became clear that cable cuts due to civil works were a major cause of incidents, ENISA published a whitepaper with good practices on how to reduce underground cable cuts. The process of incident reporting by telecom providers and the subsequent summary reporting by telecom authorities to ENISA started in 2011. Mandatory breach reporting has been part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the 2009 reform of the telecom package, which came into force in 2011 (Article 13a of the Framework directive, 2009/140/EC). In the following years, breach-reporting requirements were included in the EU eIDAS regulation and the EU’s NIS directive. Currently, security breach reporting is mandatory for incidents causing disruptions (i.e. outages). In June, the European Parliament and Council reached an agreement on an update of the legal framework called the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC). The EECC covers not only traditional telecom providers, but also over-the-top communications services. In the EECC, breach reporting will be extended to cover not only outages, but also other security breaches like, for example, confidentiality breaches. Electronic communication providers in the EU have to notify significant security incidents to the national telecom regulatory authorities (NRAs) in each EU member state. Every year, the NRAs report summaries about the most significant incidents, based on a set of agreed thresholds. Incident reporting is key for the NRAs to understand issues and trends. The positive impact of breach reporting legislation, like Article 13a, was confirmed in an independent impact assessment of telecom security legislation.

ENISA_NEWS_0316	2018-06-19	NEWS	MEP Pavel Telička  hosted breakfast discussion on Fake News in cooperation with ENISA 	" The term Fake News, more frequently described as the ‘dissemination of online disinformation’, has recently received a lot of media attention as a potential disruptor of democratic processes globally. There is a need to initiate a dialogue in the EU around the possible responses to this phenomenon. In this regard: the misuse of a computer connected to the internet, a compromised online account, a fake online account, or online platforms, may be characterised as a threat where posting on social media, emails, spam and other online activities can cause damage to others, as well as to our society at large. Under the moderation of the Vice-President of the European Parliament, the Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht and Paolo Cesarini, DG Connect of the European Commission, introduced the policy perspective. Veronika Víchová, representative of the European Values think tank, and Katarina Kertysova, representative of the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, represented the academic perspective. Google senior analyst Christian Wagner represented the industry perspective. They gathered to openly discuss the upcoming challenges and opportunities concerning Fake News in the European Union. The speakers were asked to provide their views, representing EU policy, think tanks, and the industry perspective in order to develop a clearer picture on the current state of art of the public debate. One of the main challenges discussed was the current leaning in the EU towards self-regulation over regulation. The guests all pointed out relevant initiatives, but emphasized that continuous investment and engagement is required to be able to address and hopefully solve this challenge. The conclusion was therefore to continue the debate and create more awareness on the topic, invest in innovative solutions and evaluate, and finally focus on the empowerment of the public. ENISA’s Executive Director, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, advised people to ""be resistant to fake news: stop, think and then respond”. In April 2018, the European Commission published its Communication “Tackling Online Disinformation: A European Approach”. As input to this process, ENISA presented an Opinion Paper to the Commission.

ENISA_PR_0318	2018-06-15	PR	ENISA Annual Privacy Forum 2018: shaping technology around data protection and privacy requirements 	 In the light of new technological challenges, GDPR can be the driving force for reengineering online systems and services to the benefit of end users’ privacy. The ENISA Annual Privacy Forum 2018 (APF18) is a thematic conference that was co-organised with the European Commission - DG CNECT, the Polytechnic University of Barcelona (UPC) and Telefonica on 13 and 14 June 2018. With a view to stimulating interactive discussions, identifying new trends and producing compelling input to policy-making, APF18 brought together policymakers with representatives from academia and industry. Notable speakers at this year's edition of the ENISA APF included Despina Spanou (European Commission - DG Connect), Wojciech Wiewiórowski (EDPS), Andrés Calvo Medina (Spanish DPA), Frank Dawson (Nokia) and many more. ENISA’s Executive Director, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, highlighted the significance of the emerging legal framework, which comprises the GDPR and the draft ePrivacy Regulation, which sets the stage for privacy by design and default in the EU. “ENISA”, he added, “is looking forward to working with all stakeholders, public and private, to enhance the level of compliance and afford protection to citizens and businesses across the EU”.  The Co-Chairs of APF18, Prof. Manel Medina and Prof. Kai Rannenberg, underscored the high quality of the academic track of this year’s event. Privacy by design paradigms, a panel composed of Hansen, von Grafenstein, Kiley, Kourtellis and Nanni, focused on the notion of ‘design’ in the context of contemporary software development practices and the use of specific techniques for pseudonymisation and (privacy) default settings. Online tracking, profiling and micro-targeting were discussed by Ortiz, Van Alsenoy, Nink and Novak, who explored the legal and technical safeguards that are or can be put in place to protect users of online services against tracking and profiling. Catteddu, Rey, Mclaughlin, and Hon had a lively discussion about the state of the art and the impact of GDPR on cloud services. A panel made up of Schallaböck, Boucher de Crèvecoeur, Guarino and Li debated the role of technical standards for security and privacy. APF18 was live streamed at https://tv.upc.edu/continguts/annual and it is expected that the bulk of presentations will appear on the ENISA YouTube channel.  Marcombo published select scientific contributions as pre-proceedings; Springer will publish the proceedings later in the year. The next edition of the APF will in Rome on 13 and 14 June 2019, in co-operation with the University of Rome Tor Vergata.

ENISA_NEWS_0319	2018-06-12	NEWS	Privacy matters: Join us in APF 2018!	 This two-day event is organised this year in Barcelona in co-operation with the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) and Telefonica. In the aftermath of large scale attacks that aimed at breaching personal data at a massive scale, ENISA has looked into ways to engage with a broader audience and set up a network of like-minded professionals, with a view to promote suitable policies and recommendations. This year’s edition of the APF innovates in a way by seeking to bring along the industry, to complement the policy and research components of this conference and come up with better outreach. As from 25 May 2018, the protection of personal data and privacy of individuals turned a corner in the EU, as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016/679 started applying. Additionally, the forthcoming Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications is expected to give new impetus to the way privacy is protected in electronic communications. Even the best legislative efforts cannot keep up to speed with the pace of innovative technology and business models that challenge the way personal data is processed and privacy is protected across the EU and beyond; therefore, examining what is at stake and where threats thereto originate from becomes of paramount importance. In the light of these developments, APF 2018 focuses especially on shaping technology around GDPR requirements and discussing cutting-edge issues with regard to online data protection and privacy engineering. Privacy by design, privacy enhancing technologies and solutions, online tracking, cloud privacy, the role of standards, compliance tools are some of the topics that we will be looking at through keynote speeches, panel discussions and paper session presentations, involving key stakeholders in the field. The event will be live web streamed at: https://tv.upc.edu/continguts/annual (Wednesday) and https://tv.upc.edu/continguts/annual-privacy-forum-apf-14 (Thursday) For more information, please visit the event’s website at:  http://privacyforum.eu/   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0320	2018-06-07	PR	Cyber Europe 2018 – Get prepared for the next cyber crisis	" Imagine this: It is a normal day at the airport. All of a sudden, the automated check-in machines display a system failure. Travel apps on smartphones stop functioning. The agents at the check-in counters cannot operate their computers. Travellers can neither check in their luggage, nor pass through security checks. There are huge lines everywhere. All flights are shown as cancelled on the airport monitors. For unknown reasons, baggage claim has stopped working and more than half of the flights must remain on the ground. A radical group have reportedly taken control of the airport’s critical systems by means of digital and hybrid attacks. They have already claimed responsibility for the incident and are using their propaganda channels to spread a call to action and attract more people to adopt their radical ideology. This was the intense scenario which over 900 European cybersecurity specialists from 30 countries had to face on 6 and 7 June 2018, during the ‘Cyber Europe 2018’ (CE2018) – the most mature EU cybersecurity exercise to date. The two-day exercise was orchestrated by ENISA at its headquarters in Athens, Greece, while the participants either stayed at their usual workplace or gathered in crisis cells. ENISA controlled the exercise via its Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP), which provided a ‘virtual universe’ (integrated environment) for the simulated world, including incident material, virtual news websites, social media channels, company websites and security blogs. Organised by the EU cybersecurity agency ENISA in collaboration with cybersecurity authorities and agencies from all over Europe, the CE2018 was intended to enable the European cybersecurity community to further strengthen their capabilities in identifying and tackling large-scale threats as well as to provide a better understanding of cross-border incident contagion. Most importantly, CE2018 focused on helping organisations to test their internal business continuity and crisis management plans including media crisis communication, while also reinforcing cooperation between public and private entities. The scenario contained real life-inspired technical and non-technical incidents that required network and malware analysis, forensics, and steganography. The incidents in the scenario were designed to escalate into a crisis at all possible levels: organisational, local, national and European. Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society, said: “Technology offers countless opportunities in all sectors of our economy. But there are also risks for our businesses and our citizens. The European Commission and the Member States must work together and equip themselves with the necessary tools to detect cyber-attacks and protect the networks and systems. This is how ENISA’s ‘Cyber Europe’ exercise was born eight years ago. It has grown into a major cybersecurity exercise and has become an EU flagship event which brings together hundreds of cybersecurity specialists from all over Europe. We should build on this success and I am confident that we can develop further the EU cooperation mechanisms, in particular to respond to large scale cyber incidents."" Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, explained: “Over the last decade, the aviation sector has made a tremendous leap into the evolving age of technology. We can now enjoy the benefits of navigational apps, online check-in, and automated baggage screening. Smart technology saves time, money, and makes travellers’ lives easier. However, just as technology evolves, so do cyber threats. Through events such as the Cyber Europe 2018, our agency strengthens the level of cybersecurity within the EU. European countries and organisations working together as one entity is the modern response to borderless cyber threats. On behalf of ENISA and its staff, I would like to congratulate everyone involved in the Cyber Europe 2018.” In the end, the participants were able to mitigate the incidents timely and effectively. This shows that the European cybersecurity sector has matured over the last few years and the actors are much more prepared. ENISA and the participants will shortly follow up on the exercise and analyse the actions taken to identify areas that could be improved. ENISA will publish a final report in due course. Facts at a glance Participating countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom Participating organisations: approximately 300 Number of participants: over 900 cybersecurity professionals Number of injects: 23 222 About Cyber Europe exercises ‘Cyber Europe’ exercises are simulations of large-scale cybersecurity incidents that escalate to EU-wide cyber crises. The exercises offer opportunities to analyse advanced cybersecurity incidents, and to deal with complex business continuity and crisis management situations. ENISA has already organised four pan-European cyber exercises in 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016. International cooperation between all participating organisations is inherent to the gameplay, with most European countries participating. It is a flexible learning experience: from a single analyst to an entire organisation, opt-in and opt-out scenarios, the participants can customise the exercise to their needs.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0321	2018-05-25	PR	Taking rights seriously: GDPR starts applying today	 With this regulation, the EU has legislated a robust solution, which addresses individual rights and relevant obligations of service providers, and is directly applicable to all EU Member States. Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA emphasized the significance of 25 May: “Clearly, the application of GDPR, besides its significance from a legal point of view, also gives new impetus to the policy work spearheaded by ENISA in the area of security measures for personal data protection and privacy. In the prospect of its new mandate, ENISA is looking forward to better meeting expectations also among the GDPR stakeholders.” Compared to the previous legal framework within the EU, GDPR amongst others introduces an enhanced approach on governance, accountability, the role of data protection officers, data breach notifications, risk-based strategies, security measures, consent giving and fines, providing a sound future-proof legal framework in favour of the data subjects. Notions such as “data protection by design and default” and “the right to be forgotten” open up new possibilities in practice for sensible protection of fundamental rights. ENISA has been engaging with stakeholders of personal data protection and privacy by means of the Annual Privacy Forum (APF), organised annually. APF18 takes place in Barcelona, Spain, on 13-14 June 2018 and it will be organized in collaboration with the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) and Telefónica. Additional information is available under http://privacyforum.eu/ ENISA has been a long-standing contributor to EU policy on trust and security in the Digital Single Market as it regularly issues viable recommendations to shape technology according to data protection and privacy provisions, and addressing privacy and personal data protection requirements through technology. Recently, ENISA published suitable reports seeking to translate legal obligations into technical approaches, in particular regarding the security of personal data processing[1][2], privacy and data protection by design, Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs), personal data breach notifications, as well as proposing mechanisms for user empowerment (transparency and control) in digital environments.[3][4]    For more information on policy work of ENISA regarding personal data protection and privacy, please contact: press@enisa.europa.eu.

ENISA_PR_0322	2018-05-23	PR	Four EU cybersecurity organisations enhance cooperation 	 The Memorandum of Understanding was signed by Udo Helmbrecht, ENISA's Executive Director, Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the EDA, Steven Wilson, Head of EC3 and Ken Ducatel, CERT-EU's Acting Head. The MoU aims at leveraging synergies between the four organisations, promoting cooperation on cyber security and cyber defence and is a testament to the trusted partnership that exists between these EU agencies.  More specifically, it focuses on five areas of cooperation, namely Exchange of information; Education & Training; Cyber exercises; Technical cooperation; and Strategic and administrative matters. It also allows for cooperation in other areas identified as mutually important by the four organisations. This collaboration will ensure the best possible use of existing resources by avoiding duplicative efforts and building on the complementarity of ENISA, EDA, EC3 and CERT-EU. This framework brings added value to the expertise, support and services that these parties provide to the European Union organisations, Member States and all stakeholders concerned. High Representative/Vice-President and Head of the European Defence Agency, Federica Mogherini said: “Cyberspace threats do not know of national borders. Cooperation among Member States but also at European level is therefore essential. Europe is stronger when it tackles threats together, in a common and coordinated approach. And this is exactly where this Memorandum of Understanding is key and where the added value of the European Union lies: working together, joining forces, putting the experiences and the knowledge of all at the service of our citizens' security. ” Vice-President for Digital Single Market Andrus Ansip said: “We can face cyber threats successfully if we have in place a functioning exchange of information, we have strong technical capabilities and we work on basic cyber hygiene. Better cooperation between these EU agencies will lead to this result. ” Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Dimitris Avramopoulos said: “The threats against both our physical and virtual worlds are becoming increasingly connected. This is why increasing cyber security is one of the priorities of the European Union. But we can only do this effectively through stronger cooperation and joint actions, where our operational agencies, like Europol, can play a critical role with the expertise they bring to the table in support of our Member States. ” Commissioner for the Security Union Julian King said: “The cross-border nature of the cyber threat means that cooperation has never been more important. This improved collaboration between ENISA, EDA, EC3 and CERT-EU will help us to strengthen our cyber resilience, build effective deterrence and help deliver credible cyber defence and international cooperation. ” Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, Mariya Gabriel said: “Trust and security are key components of the digital economy and society. The EU agencies should lead by example. Only by working closely together will we have a chance to mitigate the cybersecurity risks.” Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA said: “ENISA welcomes the opportunity to work closely with our partner organisations. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and it is only by cooperating closely with all relevant stakeholders that the EU has a chance to address cybersecurity challenges.” Jorge Domecq, Chief Executive of the EDA: “EDA supports Member States in the development of their defence capabilities. As such, we also act as the military interface to EU policies. Today’s Memorandum of Understanding is an important step towards increased civil-military cooperation and synergies in the area of cyber security and cyber defence.” Steven Wilson, Head of Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3): “This MoU illustrates how a safe and open cyberspace can only be achieved through enhanced cooperation and commitment. Through their participation, all parties involved demonstrate that they are willing to join forces and recognise that together we can provide the necessary response to cyber related threats. From EC3, we welcome the opportunity to enter a new era of working together with our MoU partners and are delighted to share our expertise and experience.”   Ken Ducatel, Acting Head of CERT-EU, said: “The EU institutions, bodies and agencies rely on the specialised skills and tools in threat intelligence and incident response of CERT-EU. But, we don’t maintain these capacities by acting alone. That is why acting together with our peers and partners in the other signatories to this Memorandum is so important.” The 2014 Cyber Defence Policy Framework called for the promotion of civil-military cooperation and synergies with wider EU cyber policies, relevant EU institutions and agencies as well as with the private sector. ENISA, EDA, EC3 and CERT-EU began initial discussions in 2016 which eventually led to this milestone signature. The principles behind this Memorandum of Understanding are fully in line with the implementation of the Joint Communication on Cyber issued by the High Representative and the European Commission in September 2017.   More information: European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) European Defence Agency (EDA) Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU Institutions, Agencies and Bodies (CERT-EU)     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0327	2018-05-02	NEWS	NCSC published factsheet on TLS interception	 TLS interception makes encrypted connections within the network of an organisation accessible for inspection. The use of this technical measure should be carefully considered in the light of additional risks and should meet a number of important preconditions. The reason for using TLS interception is that more and more internet services and connections use TLS encryption. This safeguards the integrity and confidentiality of the data transmitted and received. At the same time, it makes it more difficult for organizations to inspect internet traffic centrally in their network for malicious elements and confidential organizational data that leaves the organisation via the internet. The NCSC recommends organizations to conduct a review of compliance with legal requirements, covering at least the processing of personal data. In addition, it is necessary to make a thorough assessment of the usefulness and necessity of applying TLS interception in the context of other security measures. The TLS proxy must securely establish encrypted connections and be integrated within other security measures. Finally, it is important to properly secure the TLS proxy itself, because it is an attractive target.

ENISA_PR_0329	2018-04-27	PR	Strengthening Network and Information Security to protect the EU against fake news	 Online disinformation, also refered to as “fake news”, has recently received a lot of attention as a potential disruptor of democratic processes globally. There is a need to initiate a dialogue in the EU around the possible responses to this phenomenon. In this regard, ENISA publishes an opinion paper meant to present some views and recommendations on the problem of online disinformation in the EU from a Network and Information Security (NIS) perspective. To see the full opinion paper, please visit https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/fake-news/. Some of the recommendations include: Artificial intelligence, reputation reporting, and transparency The use of AI algorithms should be deployed to assist in the detection of online disinformation campaigns and misuse of online platforms such as scraping, spam, etc. The outputs of these algorithms should be verified by humans before any action is taken. Online platforms should consider deploying the results from their disinformation analysis and reporting in a transparent manner to build a confidence score on the content, which is presented to the end-user. This approach should build confidence for end-users in analysing the content presented. Source verification and fact checking Online media operators should develop signatures that could be included in their news articles, where users can verify the source of the content. Online reporting options Online platforms should clearly identify reporting locations for the ordinary user to report suspected online disinformation. The reports should be examined in a timely manner by the operators to decide on the appropriate action. The operator should have the necessary resources in place to address the challenge arising from this activity. Economic disincentives A strategy should be developed to create economic disincentives, which could include the cutting off of advertising for sites that are found to be involved in the dissemination of online disinformation. Note to editors: For the purpose of the opinion paper, online disinformation is defined as false, inaccurate, or misleading online information designed, presented and promoted with malicious intent or for profit.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0331	2018-04-18	PR	RSA Conference 2018 debate: Will the GDPR and related rules prove a competitive differentiator for Europe?	 Mr. Helmbrecht spoke at the GDPR Essentials Seminar about the rules related to this important piece of legislation and its future implications. “Data management is an important scientific field of endeavour upon which cyberspace is organised. We have shifted in a data-rich period that is fuelled by the suite of cloud computing, sensors, big data while we are slowly but surely shifting to an Artificial Intelligence managed environment,” Mr. Helmbrecht said in the opening statement. He continued: “Clearly there is an economic impact on the private sector that seeks GDPR compliance. GDPR is not about stopping existing processes but about doing them in a different, way, putting data subjects in control of their data. The role of technology is key in this approach. In a recent ENISA’s study on privacy and data protection for mobile apps, it was shown that contemporary software design methodologies do not adequately reflect privacy and security needs, often leading to data breaches and consumers mistrust. GDPR can provide the incentives to alter this situation by mandating privacy by design. ENISA has been doing a lot of work in the area of privacy and data protection by design and is promoting the use of privacy enhancing technologies (PETs), such as encryption tools or anonymization/pseusonymisation mechanisms. GDPR impacts data science as the discretion to manage data is placed under the scope of the Regulation, which might be quite limiting for some e.g. interconnecting sets of data might become even more conditional than it currently is.” Mr. Helmbrecht concluded his speech by stating: “At the end of the day, GDPR is here to stay and the great opportunity is to set up data policies that are mindful to the rights of the holders of the greatest commodity in cyberspace, which is personal data. At the same time, GDPR can create incentives and new business opportunities for a new area of privacy friendly tools and services, especially in online environments. This can be a competitive advantage for those that put in place GDPR compliant policies, especially if combined with GDPR or broader certification schemes.”     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0333	2018-03-30	PR	ENISA publishes the first comprehensive study on cyber Threat Intelligence Platforms	 The study channels its efforts into identifying some of the key opportunities and limitations of existing platforms and solutions, since information exchange formats and tools remain central items on the agenda of the cybersecurity community in general, and particularly of incident responders. The project came as an acknowledgment of the increasing demand for relevant and ‘context aware’ security data, as information security management is becoming a key component of any modern organisation.  For the purpose of this project, ENISA has engaged leading field experts and has performed a research of existing tools, practices and TIPs academic literature. The report concludes with a series of actionable findings and recommendations, so that current TIPs limitations are addressed and overcome. Furthermore, the report presents a detailed overview of the users of these platforms, the main functional areas of TIPs as well as the current landscape of the TIPs used globally by different teams (CTI teams, SOCs, CSIRTs/CERTs, ISACs, etc.). The report concludes with a series of recommendations addressed to users and organisations, TIPs developers and vendors as well as the research community and academia. ENISA recommends organisations to focus on their specific requirements and needs before developing and deploying TIP solutions. In addition, ENISA strongly encourages organisations to check if the different cyber intelligence activities they undertake are enabled by technology platforms and systems. Moreover, organisations are encouraged to invest time on Proof of Concepts with an open source TIPs, to familiarize themselves with the benefits of such systems, before making any significant financial investment. ENISA encourages TIPs solution developers to focus more on enhancing TIP analysis capabilities by providing efficient threat triage and relevancy assessment. In addition, TIPs should come with more flexible and usable trust modelling functionalities. Furthermore, TIPs developers and vendors are encouraged to provide threat information consumers with functionalities allowing them to be informed in case the confidence and accuracy of the shared information is not guaranteed by the source. ENISA calls upon the research community and academia to continue pursuing and investigating the benefits of TIPs, and the means by which these platforms may mature further. The report is complemented by a TIPs maturity model assessment scheme provided as an ANNEX. As a centre of expertise in the field of cyber security, ENISA will continue to monitor the evolution of threat intelligence platforms and services, as part of the Agency’s commitment to contribute to a more secure and safe cyberspace.

ENISA_PR_0335	2018-03-28	PR	Legacy technologies as a threat to EU’s telecommunications infrastructure	 Nowadays, telecommunications is a key infrastructure based on how our society works. It constitutes the main instrument that allows our democracy and our EU core values such as freedom, equality, rule of law and human rights to function properly. There are currently over 5 billion unique mobile subscribers and over 2000 mobile operators worldwide.  In Europe, we have 456 million unique mobile subscribers, which is equivalent to 84% of the population. Mobile networks worldwide are still depending on SS7 and Diameter for controlling communications (routing voice calls and data) as well as on sets of protocols that were designed decades ago without giving adequate effect to modern day security implications. In this respect, the interconnected environment has become perilous. As today’s society is becoming more and more digital, such vulnerabilities might inhibit the proper functioning of the mobile networks, thereby impacting the operation of the digital markets. A full range of new services (e.g. cloud, financial etc.) is being developed or is relying on the primary infrastructure offered by electronic communication providers (e.g. energy, transportation, eHealth etc.). “In this context, ENISA has developed a study, which has examined a critical area of electronic communications: the security of interconnections in electronic communications, also known as signalling security. An EU level assessment of the current situation has been developed, so that we better understand the threat level, measures in place and possible next steps to be taken,” said Udo Helmbrecht, ENISA’s Executive Director. The most important findings of the study are: The first generations of 2G/3G mobile networks rely on SS7, a protocol designed decades ago without considering security. The industry and security research community has started to look into the good practices and necessary tools that are already available. Basic security measures seem to have been implemented by more mature providers, but these measures only assure a basic level of protection. Still, more efforts are needed to be made in order to achieve an adequate level of protection across the EU. Current 4G mobile telecommunication generation uses a slightly improved signalling protocol called Diameter. Based on the same interconnect principles, the protocol was proved to be theoretically vulnerable. The industry is still trying to understand exactly what the implications are and to identify possible workarounds. It is highly probable that in the near future we will see real attacks as well as suitable solutions becoming available. The new 5G mobile generation is still under development. Early releases from some manufacturers are already available, but the standards are still in their infancy. Nevertheless, there is a risk of history repeating. Given the improvements that 5G will bring – such as more subscribers, increased bandwidth etc. – having the same security risks can be extremely dangerous. The report also makes several recommendations to stakeholders: The EU Commission: Consider revising the current legal landscape in order to encompass signalling security Consider the adoption of baseline security requirements for electronic communications providers to include signalling security. National Responsible Authorities: Regularly analyse the situation at national level and be aware of any developments that can trigger significant incidents in this area If necessary, consider revising the national legislation, so that signalling security is covered in terms of incident reporting and adoption of minimum security requirements. The industry: Electronic communication providers: implement the necessary measures to ensure an adequate level of security and integrity of telecommunication networks Responsible standardisation bodies: ensure that signalling security is properly covered within the new 5G standards. The report was developed with support from ENISA’s Art. 13a Expert Group, an informal group of EU national regulators from most of the Member States, covering security and integrity in electronic communications providers. Reaching out to EU operators has been done through them and the group members have been involved in the validation of the findings. The project is part of the overall work ENISA is delivering periodically within the Art. 13a Expert Group. Since 2010, ENISA has committed substantial resources and provided a lot of guidelines and other materials to support the EU electronic telecommunication area. The European Commission was also involved in the study, in its capacity of policy-maker and responsible for the good implementation of the 5G PPP project. In addition, the GSMA has hugely supported the development of the project by giving us access to specific documentation and promoting the study among their stakeholders.

The study was published in November 2017 and has been presented to various international fora, including recently at the Mobile World Congress 2018. ENISA has been providing good practices and recommendations on securing IoT for several years and is continuing to support industry and Member States in relevant matters. The workshop concluded with a panel moderated by Dan Sjöblom - on what future implications the different security challenges may have for regulators and the deployment of 5G in the context of IoT. In the context of the new EU Electronic Communications Code and the Network and Information Security Directive, the workshop underlined the significance of closer cooperation between National Regulatory Authorities and the private sector. Moreover, the importance of collaboration between ENISA and BEREC was highlighted, as well as the need to ensure cybersecurity in the highly dynamic and evolving landscape of 5G and IoT.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0346	2018-03-02	PR	Towards the emerging EU framework on certification 	 The aim of this conference was for ENISA to bring to a broader audience, selected aspects of the emerging EU framework on certification of products and services. Over 240 registered parties representing industry, conformity assessment bodies, government organisations, standardisation bodies and EU institutions supported this event. The Executive Director of ENISA, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht opened the conference, by quoting that: “ENISA is a key contributor to the emerging EU certification framework. This conference plays an important role in shaping the discussion with key stakeholders at a time when the legislative process concerning the Cybersecurity Act in still underway.” Dr. Despina Spanou, Director for Digital Society, Trust and Cybersecurity with the European Commission and member of the ENISA Management Board delivered a statement providing valuable insight on the background and main goals of the draft Cybersecurity Act. Mr. Krasimir Simonski representing the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council provided his insight on the Cybersecurity Act delivering important views of the Presidency. Dr. Martin Schaffer, speaking on behalf of the European Cybersecurity Organisation (ECSO) presented the latest ECSO contribution on certification. Additionally, the conference addressed ENISA's activities in the area of cybersecurity certification, the EU Member States’ views on the proposal on cybersecurity certification framework, and industry challenges and opportunities in future cybersecurity certification schemes. The draft Cybersecurity Act foresees new tasks for ENISA in terms of: Drawing up cybersecurity schemes within the EU certification framework; Support the European Commission in the European Cybersecurity Certification Group. Until the Cybersecurity Act comes into force, some of ENISA’s objectives in certification include compiling a list of prospective schemes based on the current ones and seeking to transition to an EU certification framework, as well as prospective schemes based on new application areas e.g. consumers, classes of products e.g. IoT and types of services e.g. Cloud; At the end of the Conference Prof. Helmbrecht suggested that ENISA is looking forward to fulfilling its role in supporting EU cyber certification and the further development of the Digital Single Market.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0347	2018-02-14	PR	Cybersecurity built on trust – ENISA supports Member States in establishing PPPs and ISACs	 A common objective of every European national cyber security strategy is collaboration to enhance cyber security across all levels, from threat information sharing to awareness raising. Collaboration is often achieved through two formal structures: Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs) and Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). Since many critical infrastructures are under private jurisdiction, cooperation between public and private sectors is essential to achieve an adequate level of cybersecurity. Moreover, European legislations like the NIS Directive and the newly announced Cybersecurity Act encourage the creation of sectoral ISACs and PPPs within the EU. ENISA collected information on best practices and common approaches that resulted in two studies, namely Cooperative Models for Public Private Partnership and Information Sharing and Analysis Centres. Both reports are addressed at policy and lawmakers, national cybersecurity authorities, the CSIRT community, the general public and private organizations with an interest in network and information security. Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, said: “Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility and ENISA, together with the community, is continually working towards making collaboration as well as information and knowledge sharing stronger. The multi-faceted efforts of ENISA across the cybersecurity spectrum continues to support and promote a safer Europe with better cybersecurity.” PPPs are long-term agreements and collaborations between representatives of public and private sectors. The study on PPPs identifies four PPP models existing within the EU Member States: Institutional PPPs, goal-oriented PPPs, service outsourcing PPPs and hybrid PPPs. ISACs are trusted entities, whose purpose is to foster sharing of information and good practices about physical and cyber threats, as well as mitigation. In the study on ISACs, the most common approaches are categorized into three different models: country focused, sector specific and international structures. The main finding of both studies is that trust is the most essential factor in establishing and maintaining cooperation between private and public sectors. Both reports provide some specific recommendations: For PPPs: Legal basis is essential when creating a PPP Investment on private-private and public-public collaboration is also critical for PPPs Open communication and a pragmatic approach are vital for setting up a PPP Small and medium Enterprises (SMEs) should also participate in PPPs For ISACs: Creating a structure which motivates the private sector is essential for an ISAC Establishing a facilitator to involve all participants is also crucial for ISACs The production of valuable results is key to the success of an ISAC Cross sector collaboration is also very important for the effectiveness of ISACs Public and private sector stakeholders validated the two studies during the fifth ENISA-NCSS workshop, which was co-organised in October 2017 with NCSC in The Hague, the Netherlands.

ENISA_NEWS_0349	2018-02-06	NEWS	“Everyone has a role in keeping the internet safer!”  Udo Helmbrecht on Safer Internet Day	 Mr. Helmbrecht speaking at the event with Commissioner Gabriel complimented the EU Commission on this initiative and commented on the importance of raising awareness in respect of online child safety and cyber-hygiene: “Safer Internet Day has become a landmark event in the online safety calendar, and the Safer Internet Centres are at the heart of protecting the youth. Nowadays, the evolution of technology generates risks. People of all ages connect with friends and family online, download apps, share their photographs, activities and locations. In these circumstances, children are exposed and vulnerable to cyber-bullying, false news, inappropriate content and online predators. We can reduce these risks by taking basic cyber-hygiene measures, such as using strong passwords, backing up valuable information, patching devices, scrutinising email attachments and links, but above all, encouraging the youth to think critically. Parents, guardians and teachers should stay informed on current issues to understand what their children are experiencing on and off the Internet. Everyone has a role in keeping the internet safer!” ENISA’s Executive Director also went over the Agency’s recent efforts in the area of digital skills and cyber-hygiene, such as the European Cyber Security Month and the European Cyber Security Challenge. He also mentioned the release of several relevant reports such as “Cybersecurity Culture in Organisations”, “Cyber Hygiene Practices Report”, and “Status of privacy and NIS Course Curricula in Member States”.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0351	2018-02-06	PR	Strong cybersecurity culture as efficient firewall for organisations	 ENISA’s Cybersecurity Culture in Organisations report is based on a multi-disciplinary research, conducted to better understand the dynamics of how cybersecurity culture can be developed and shaped within organisations. This research draws from different disciplines, including organisational sciences, psychology, law and cybersecurity as well as the knowledge and experiences of large European organisations. The report provides good practices, methodological tools and step-by-step guidance for those seeking to commence or enhance their organisation’s cybersecurity culture programme. Cybersecurity culture refers to the knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, norms and values of people regarding cybersecurity and how these manifest in interacting with information technologies. It reflects the understanding that the organisation’s actions are dependent on shared beliefs, values and actions of its employees, including their attitude towards cybersecurity. While many organisations and employees are familiar with related concepts such as cybersecurity awareness and information security frameworks, cybersecurity culture covers a broader scope. The idea behind this concept is to make information security considerations an integral part of an employee’s daily life. Multiple drivers are responsible for organisations to recognise the need of a cybersecurity culture. First, cyber threat awareness campaigns alone do not provide sufficient protection against ever evolving cyber-attacks. Additionally, technical cybersecurity measures need to be in accordance with other business processes, and, lastly, it is important that employees need to act as a strong human firewall against cyber-attacks. Against this background, ENISA has conducted research on cybersecurity culture to provide guidance for organisations. As the study’s information is intended to be contextualised to the individual needs and circumstances of each individual organisation, the guidance is applicable to any organisation, regardless of structure, size or industry. Additionally, the following good practices have been identified, based on the experiences of organisations that have already implemented mature cybersecurity culture programmes: Setting cybersecurity as a standing agenda item at board meetings to underline the importance of a robust cybersecurity culture Ensure that employees are consulted and their concerns regarding cybersecurity practices are being considered by the cybersecurity culture working group Ensure that business processes/strategies and cybersecurity processes/strategies are fully aligned Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0352	2018-02-02	NEWS	ENISA contributes to the development of groundbreaking EU cybersecurity regulation on Digital Service Providers in the context of the NIS Directive	 The European Commission has published the implementing regulation for the application of Directive (EU) 2016/1148 pursuant Art 16(8) of NIS Directive. This initiative provisions further specification of the elements to be taken into account by Digital Service Providers (DSPs) for managing the risks posed to the security of network and information systems and of the parameters for determining whether an incident has a substantial impact. The EU Cybersecurity ENISA closely supported the European Commission’s Network and Information Systems Security Comitology Committee responsible for developing the implementing act. Our Agency conducted intensive research with the purpose of providing technical input for drafting this important initiative. Two ENISA reports that laid the groundwork for the Comitology Committee’s work were published: one focusing on incident notification for DSPs, and one putting forward minimum security measures for DSPs. ENISA carried out numerous interviews with industry representatives, in order to ensure a smooth transfer of knowledge and a proper understanding of DSPs’s technical and business specificities. The DSPs incident notification requirements are part of the European Union’s first wide set of cybersecurity rules. This groundbreaking piece of legislation represents a major step towards achieving a common level of cybersecurity across the Union. DSPs are the owners or administrators of the underlying systems currently called either Internet or Digital Society. Alongside telecom providers, DSPs make the digital infrastructure available to operators of essential services. It is therefore reasonable to believe that they play an important role in assuring the cybersecurity of our digital market, ergo they will be the first ones required to adopt measures. Recitals 35 and 44 of the NIS Directive provide valuable insights in this respect.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0353	2018-02-01	NEWS	Standards flying: improving the recognition of ICT security standards	 The main assertions of this report include the following: Standardisation for compliance with the NIS Directive is essential; Recognition of standardisation in policy has generally be deemed to be low; Utilisation of standards add value to Member States and their infrastructure; The use of standards raises Cyber Security levels of compliance and effectiveness; The use of standards provides sustainability and interoperability at European level and beyond. Based on a survey only inconclusive suggestions can be made with regard to a perceived lack of knowledge of standards. If an appropriate standard is available, it is reasonable to expect that it will be adopted or applied. For example, even though the ISO27000 series of standards consists of sets of broad guidance, there is a well-established eco-system that supports their implementation. In terms of the NIS Directive, however a major concern stems from the fact that it is the prerogative of the MS concerned to seek implementation. Where cross-border information sharing is required, this requirement has been interpreted as a competence under existing CSIRT relationships used for reporting security incidents; it would be far more effective of course to broadly seek compliance with the NIS Directive within and across borders. To improve the current situation the main recommendations of the report include: Appropriate training initiatives to be undertaken at the level of Member States; Promoting new work items in the European SDOs for some areas (e.g. criteria for defining OES / DSP) or the adoption of appropriate standards in Europe where existing (for example information exchange, where several mature efforts already are in place, like STIX ).   Read the report here: Improving recognition of ICT security standards     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0355	2018-01-30	NEWS	ENISA organises cyber-exercise to boost CSIRT cooperation	 Over 70 specialists from national CSIRTs and CERT-EU were engaged in the exercise, whose scenario revolved around cyber-incidents occurring in the maritime sector. The setup of the exercise provided the context for cooperation and development of creative ideas. Cyber SOPEx is the first step in a series of ENISA exercises focusing on training the participants on situational awareness, information sharing, understanding roles and responsibilities and utilising related tools, as agreed by the CSIRTs Network. The long-term goal of this project is to enhance the cooperation in operational cybersecurity within the EU. Computer Security Incident Response Teams, also known as CSIRTs, work together within the ‘CSIRTs Network’ – an entity established by the NIS Directive to contribute to developing confidence and trust between the Member States and to promote swift and effective operational cooperation. ENISA provides the secretariat of the CSIRTs network and actively supports the cooperation among them. The Agency organises meetings for the network, and initiates discussion by proposing diverse topics.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0356	2018-01-29	PR	ENISA celebrates the European Data Protection Day	 This date marks the anniversary of the Council of Europe Convention 108 on the protection of personal information, the landmark international law in the field of personal data protection. Privacy by design and security of personal data processing On this occasion, ENISA takes the opportunity to share some of its work in the fields of privacy by design and security of personal data processing. With its latest report on ’Privacy and data protection in mobile apps‘, the Agency analyses the features of the app development environment that affect privacy and security. Additionally, this report discusses the promise that implementing privacy by design holds for data controllers and data subjects alike. To this end, this report explicitly highlights the need for scalable methodologies and best practices that can help integrate privacy requirements into contemporary app design practices, while enhancing usability and addressing all parties of the complex app ecosystem. Moreover, ENISA with its ’Handbook on security of personal data processing’ complements its previously published guidelines on risk assessment and security measures for SMEs by providing specific use cases on pragmatic processing operations that are common for all SMEs. For each use case, the handbook provides guidelines on the application of ENISA’s approach in order to assess in practice the risks that affect the rights and freedoms of data subjects and to facilitate the adoption of the technical and organisational measures that are commensurate with the risk presented.

ENISA_PR_0357	2018-01-26	PR	Building a common language to face future incidents - ENISA and European CSIRTs establish a dedicated task force	 Over the past few years, there have been numerous discussions on the topic of ‘security incident classification taxonomies’. A number of initiatives even resulted in new or modified taxonomies, such as the ‘Common Taxonomy for (LE) Law Enforcement and CSIRTs’, which was set up to simplify the cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement agencies (LEAs). This taxonomy resulted from collaboration initiatives such as the annual ENISA/Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) Workshop, which involved CSIRTs, LEAs, ENISA, and EC3. Other examples include the eCSIRT.net taxonomy, which was developed in 2003, and the eCSIRT.net mkVI taxonomy, an adaptation of the original version. Creating a taxonomy is a difficult task as for instance classifying security incidents is very complex due to overlapping categories and different facets of such incidents. Organisations defining taxonomies are typically driven by their own needs, and since different CSIRTs have distinct expectations, those teams often end up developing their own incident classifications for internal use. In fact, even the ‘Common Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs’ is an adaptation of the CERT.PT taxonomy, which in turn is based on the eCSIRT.net mkVI taxonomy. Likewise, there have been many taxonomies that are in essence only modifications of other versions. As the need for information exchange, incident reporting and use of automation in incident response increases, it is becoming evident that developing a set of standardised guidelines is crucial. This common ground would help incident handlers in dealing with technical incidents on a daily basis. Moreover, it could assist policy decision makers by offering a standardised reference for discussing and drafting relevant policies such as the EU cyber security strategy and ‘The Directive on security of network and information systems’ (NIS Directive). Following a discussion amongst the CSIRT community during the ‘51st TF-CSIRT meeting’  (15 May 2017 in The Hague, Netherlands), it was concluded that there is an urgent need for a taxonomy list and name that serves as a fixed reference for everyone. This is where the so-called ‘Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy Task Force’ comes into play. The aim of this task force is to enable the CSIRT community in reaching a consensus on a universal reference taxonomy. Additionally, the task force covers the following objectives: Develop a reference document Define and develop an update and versioning mechanism Host the reference document Organise regular physical meetings with stakeholders The next meeting will be held during the ‘53rd TF-CSIRT meeting’ (5-7 February 2018 co-located with FIRST in Hamburg, Germany) where the following topics will be addressed: Confirm starting point for the reference taxonomy Review and consolidate incident classifications and definitions of the reference taxonomy Define update workflow and versioning mechanism Decide about who will be hosting the online reference taxonomy Propose the next steps It is important to note that the task force is composed of members of European CSIRT teams, the Common Taxonomy Governance Group (including representatives from ENISA and EC3), tool developers (MISP/IntelMQ, etc.), and taxonomy owners (owner of eCSIRT.net).

ENISA_NEWS_0358	2018-01-24	NEWS	Scaling new heights: Implementation and Uptake of Trust Services under the eIDAS Regulation	 Driving this trend is the positive response of eIDAS to the requirements of these industries for legal certainty, integrity and shortened time to market. The eIDAS Regulation seeks to facilitate seamless digital transactions among individuals and businesses across the EU and since 1 July 2016, it is directly applicable in all EU Member States. While eIDAS has been broadly seen by stakeholders as a key enabler towards digital transformation, organisations across the board can be greatly facilitated and encouraged to deliver their strategies with confidence should they chose to follow the eIDAS framework. Additionally, the prevailing EU regulatory framework in electronic payments, financial markets, and personal data protection can look upon the eIDAS framework for dependable and compliant solutions to implementation issues at hand. In spite of the patently positive signal for existing and well established Trust services, a gap in the understanding of stakeholders in terms of Trust services still lingers under the eIDAS Regulation. This situation is exacerbated by the ad hoc oligopoly in market niches such as browsers, for instance, as well as in actual stakeholders’ knowledge of concrete implementation models. Member States may still choose to take up the important role of filling potential and actual standardisation gaps. They may also seek to pursue eIDAS compliant implementations when deploying eGovernment services. While the eIDAS Regulation has gone past important milestones and has become a reference point in the EU, it still has some way to go in terms of newly introduced Trust services and broader user acceptance. ENISA seeks to ease up the implementation phase of the eIDAS Regulation and in this regard it regularly produces analyses and reviews on the EU legal framework and standards.

ENISA_PR_0359	2018-01-18	PR	Overview of ICT certification laboratories 	 In addition, the study provides a comparison to the practices used in non-EU countries. Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, stated that “the findings of this study will constitute a valuable input to the preparation of an EU-wide ICT security certification framework.” Certification plays an important role in raising the level of trust and security in ICT products and services. As technology proliferates, expectations about security sometimes cannot be met. Therefore, certification functions as a means to help bridge this gap and give consumers the confidence they need to embrace new technology without doubt. As a result, individual Member State initiatives have sought to set high cybersecurity requirements for ICT technologies on existing infrastructure. Even though those initiatives are important as they provide guidelines for ICTs, they also increase the risk of market fragmentation and increase the challenges regarding interoperability. The current legal framework for certification labs is structured as follows: General requirements defined in the Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council; Member State level requirements from relevant accreditation bodies; Certification or evaluation requirements from various standards; Requirements emerging from international arrangements. The study concludes that most laboratories currently operate under their respective Member State schemes. Although these schemes provide services to evaluate the security of ICT products based on an approved and unified methodology, the legal and business framework they operate in varies across countries, often reflecting the characteristics of local economies and policies of the certification lab’s home country. By evaluating additional non-EU laboratories, the report goes one step further and identifies relevant patterns, similarities and differences.

ENISA_PR_0360	2018-01-15	PR	ENISA report: the 2017 cyber threat landscape	 Nevertheless, 2017 also saw many successful operations against cyber-criminals. Law enforcement authorities, governments and vendors managed to shut down illegal dark markets, de-anonymize the Darknet and arrest cyber-criminals. The EU Cybersecurity Agency ENISA assessed and analysed these aspects and has put together the sixth issue of its annual report ”ENISA Threat Landscape” (ETL). Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society: “Understanding the key cybersecurity threats that the EU must respond to and the way in which they are evolving is essential if we are to successfully protect the cyberspace, the key enabler of the EU Digital Single Market. The ENISA Threat Landscape therefore contributes in a very significant way to the digital future of Europe.” Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, explains: “The ENISA Threat Landscape provides a prioritised list of threats based on over 350 information sources in such a way that the important trends can be understood not only by industry professionals, but by decision makers in a wide variety of roles. It is a valuable record of what has happened and a unique tool in predicting what is yet to come.” This year, ENISA improved readability and usability of its report and has launched a web application containing information on the top 15 cyber threats encountered in 2017. The application is available at etl.enisa.europa.eu and offers intuitive navigation through relevant information objects. In addition to the top 15 cyber threats, which are also presented in the web application, the ETL 2017 covers threat agents, common attacks, and trends. It identifies open issues that are based on these trends and puts forward policy, business and research/educational recommendations, to be considered for future ENISA/EU activities and by their stakeholders.

ENISA_NEWS_0362	2018-01-10	NEWS	Towards a new role and mandate for ENISA	 The event was focused on “Addressing cybersecurity challenges and supporting a thriving cybersecurity industry in the EU”. Prof. Dr. Helmbrecht centred his speech on the crucial role that ENISA will play in the near future and its important contribution to a high level of cybersecurity in a market that is expected to exceed EUR 24 billion this year and to grow by 6% annually. ENISA’s Executive Director highlighted the following: “We believe that the proposal for a permanent mandate will facilitate the delivery of better results in the long term. The proposed increase of financial and human resources, as well as the opportunity to carry out new tasks will enhance our work in the implementation of the NIS Directive.  The foreseen enhanced cooperation with CERT-EU and the opportunity to bring ENISA’s expertise to the table will support the Member States much better. In light of the current European threat landscape, enhanced cooperation can only be of benefit to everybody.  The draft proposal also outlines a cybersecurity certification scheme and the creation of the EU cybersecurity certification group. This proposal is welcomed and should contribute to the development of a pan-European cybersecurity product and service market.  ENISA looks forward to working with all stakeholders in the next few months to assist the co-legislators in finalising the new regulation.”  Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht’s full speech is available here: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/ed-speeches/towards-a-new-role-and-mandate-for-enisa-and-ecsm  For more information on the event, please visit: https://europa.eu/newsroom/events/cybersecurity-challenges-and-supporting-thriving-cybersecurity-industry-eu_en   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0363	2017-12-19	PR	A digital Europe built on trust – ENISA guidelines on uptake of Qualified Trust Services 	 In order to ensure a high-level security of qualified trust services, the electronic identification, authentication and trust services regulation (eIDAS) foresees an active supervision scheme of qualified trust service providers (QTSP) and the qualified trust services (QTS) they provide by the national competent supervisory bodies (SB). The SB supervise, ex ante and ex post, the fulfilment of the regulation’s legal requirements and obligations. eIDAS aims to ensure that the QTSP and the QTS they provide meet the requirements laid down from initiation up to termination of such services. The following reports provide recommendations and guidelines to eIDAS stakeholders: Guidelines on initiation of qualified trust services; Guidelines on supervision of qualified trust services; Guidelines on termination of qualified trust services. Working towards a harmonized adoption of the eIDAS regulation, further guidance is needed in order to support the fulfilment of requirements originating from the non-mandatory articles of the regulation. QTSP should therefore take appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of the trust services they provide and to prevent and minimise the impact of security incidents. Moreover, guidelines are needed to support the QTSP to prepare for the conformity assessment with respect to the eIDAS regulation requirements and obligations. Within this scope, ENISA has prepared the following reports: Recommendation for QTSP based on Standards; Conformity assessment of QTSP; Security framework for QTSP. The eIDAS regulation provides a regulatory environment for the electronic identification of natural and legal persons and for a set of electronic trust services, namely electronic signatures, seals, time stamps, registered delivery services and certificates for website authentication. The eIDAS regulation sets the principle of non-discrimination of the legal effects and admissibility of electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and electronic documents as evidence in legal proceedings. Courts (or other bodies in charge of legal proceedings) cannot discard them as evidence only because they are electronic, but have to assess these tools in the same way they would do for their paper equivalent. To further enhance the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers in the internal market and to promote the use of trust services and products, the eIDAS regulation introduces the notions of quality trust service and quality trust service provider with a view to indicating requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security and a higher presumption of their legal effect.

ENISA_NEWS_0365	2017-12-15	NEWS	Supporting the fight against cybercrime: ENISA reports on CSIRTs and law enforcement cooperation	 These reports address the technical, legal and organisational aspects of the cooperation between Computer Security Information Response Teams (CSIRTs) - in particular national/governmental CSIRTs - and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) and provide recommendations to help them cooperate closer in the fight against cybercrime. The data collected for these reports confirms that CSIRTs and LEAs often exchange information during an incident handling/investigations, both formally and informally and that trust is the key success factor in their cooperation. Other findings of these reports are: The information sharing between CSIRTs and LEAs happens more ad-hoc than in a systematic manner; CSIRTs and LEAs have different objectives and ways to collect and process information. However, there is an increased reciprocal understanding of needs between the two communities; CSIRTs and LEAs face some challenges when they cooperate; these challenges are of more legal and organisational essence than technical. The data for these reports were collected via desk research, subject-matter expert interviews and an online survey. To enhance CSIRT-LE cooperation, among others, the following is proposed: Build and maintain a centralised repository of tools and methodologies, forms and procedures, used for the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEAs in the EU; Place liaison officers on both ends; Further invest in CSIRT-LEA training and skills development.

ENISA_NEWS_0367	2017-12-07	NEWS	Stocktaking of information security training needs in critical sectors	 Cybersecurity awareness raising trainings are lagging behind. There is currently a shortage of trainings in specific threats encountered in different (sub)sectors and of trainings in the area of decision making as a result of data leakages or privacy incidents. Although the EU cybersecurity training field is extensive and diversified, it hardly addresses the issue of raising the critical infrastructures’ cyber-resilience. Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) related trainings are still a niche. There is a shortage of specialized trainings in the field of Industrial Control Systems - Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, which is an essential element in countering operational threats. Furthermore, in light of the upcoming entering into force of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), there is a high demand for specialised trainings, particularly since the new regulation sets out sanctions for any potential breach of personal data.  These are the key findings of ENISA’s stocktaking study performed in the context of the ‘Directive on security of network and information systems’ (NIS Directive). The study is focused on assessing the current state-of-play and on determining if there are any training needs specific to each of the critical sectors that the NIS Directive puts an emphasis on.   Over the past 10 years, the EU Cybersecurity ENISA has developed a wide range of cybersecurity trainings. Therefore, the study is set to evaluate the effectiveness of ENISA’s training portfolio, and to determine how to best adjust its training capabilities to the existing needs. In this regard, the study sets forth the following conclusions: trainings should be tailored, presenting the context of threats and risks related to each sector. In particular, dependencies and mutual influence of infrastructures operating in different sectors should be explained, along with their possible impact on cybersecurity issues concerning for example global payments or air traffic control; trainings should be provided in more languages; it is recommended to see if ‘cyber-range’ and gamification based trainings may provide a more effective approach than traditional trainings; on-demand training accessibility is gaining in importance. Finally, it is advised to organise a pilot study in all critical sectors to further gauge the results of this study and develop implementable proposals on how to improve the training situation in that sector. According to the NIS Directive, the critical sectors are energy, transport, banking, financial markets, healthcare, water and digital infrastructure. The NIS Directive states that “network and information systems and services play a vital role in society”, and that “magnitude, frequency and impact of security incidents are increasing, and represent a major threat”. The protection of the seven critical sectors must have the highest priority within the EU. If these sectors are threatened, the functioning of society itself and the health and well-being of its citizens are under threat. An important part of that priority is to increase the competences of cybersecurity personnel. This requires the availability of high-quality trainings across the board, accessible to all critical sectors.

ENISA_NEWS_0370	2017-11-29	NEWS	Annual Incident Analysis Report for the Trust Service Providers	 Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation requires providers of trust services to assess risks, take appropriate security measures to mitigate the risks and notify significant incidents and breaches to their supervisory body. Article 19 also addresses various types of incident reporting to other different stakeholders e.g. users, data protection authorities, competent national bodies for information security, ENISA, which are involved in its implementation. The EU Member States should therefore efficiently analyse and then implement these notification flows in order to comply with the incident notification requirements of the regulation. In 2014, after eIDAS was adopted, ENISA formed an experts group to work together with specialists from competent authorities on the application of Article 19 and, more generally, on security incidents in trust services. Only one incident was registered in the second half of 2016, which is the reference period. This incident was related to the validation of qualified certificates for electronic signatures service and the root cause was a system failure due to an update. However, the TSP dealt promptly with this issue and took the appropriate measures to avoid its recurrence. To download the full report: Annual Incident Analysis Report for the Trust Service Providers Background information: The regulation for electronic identification and trust services ‘Regulation (EU) No 910/2014’ – also known as ‘the eIDAS Regulation’ – was adopted on 23 July 2014. The eIDAS Regulation enables the use of electronic identification and trust services by citizens, businesses and public administrations, to access online services or manage electronic transactions. eIDAS plays an important role in fulfilling the Digital Single Market strategy, as it provides one common legal framework for all parties while relying on or providing electronic transaction services. The eIDAS Regulation introduces the notions of ‘qualified trust service’ and ‘qualified trust service provider’ with the purpose of further enhancing the trust of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and consumers in the internal market. This novelty wishes to indicate the requirements and obligations that ensure high-level security. As a consequence, they are granted a higher presumption of their legal effect.

ENISA_PR_0371	2017-11-27	PR	ENISA report: Concepts and recommendations on European Data Protection Certification mechanisms	 Today, ENISA publishes a report destined to familiarise data protection experts with the terminology of certification and to clarify concepts which are relevant to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) certification. The report identifies and analyses challenges and opportunities faced by data protection certification mechanisms, including seals and marks. As of 25 May 2018, GDPR will be the main data protection legal framework in the EU and will be directly applicable to all EU Member States. GDPR will introduce provisions on certification to enhance the transparency of data controllers’ processing operations and the processors. The legislature also envisages a role of certification in assisting controllers and processors to demonstrate compliance with the regulation. Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, stated: “The GDPR is a landmark piece of legislation which is designed to protect personal information. Given the digitalisation of our world protecting our personal data is critical to the operation of the Digital Single Market, I expect that this report will contribute to the effective implementation of this important piece of legislation.” Goal-oriented certifications GDPR data protection mechanisms should not focus only on whether measures are in place or not, but also on to what extent such measures are sufficient in ensuring compliance with the provisions of the regulation. Certifying a processing operation The GDPR regulates the processing of personal data, which may be conducted for a product, system or service. The regulation requires that a certification mechanism under GDPR must concern an activity of data processing. However, the certification must be granted in relation to the processing activity or activities and not to the product, system or service as such. Certification as an accountability-based mechanism A controller that has had its processing operations successfully evaluated by a certification body may use the certification and its supporting documentation as an element to demonstrate compliance to the supervisory authority. The fact that data protection certification in the GDPR is an accountability-based mechanism is supported by its voluntary nature. The recommendations of the report are meant to be of use to all actors involved, from the European Commission and the European Data Protection Board to national certification bodies and supervisory authorities – who are in a position to develop a harmonised understanding of GDPR data protection certification mechanisms and to provide further guidelines should queries and/or challenges arise.

ENISA_PR_0373	2017-11-20	PR	Defining and securing the Internet of Things: ENISA publishes a study on how to face cyber threats in critical information infrastructures 	 The study which is titled ‘Baseline Security Recommendations for Internet of Things in the context of critical information infrastructures’, aims to set the scene for IoT security in Europe. It serves as a reference point in this field  and as a foundation for relevant forthcoming initiatives and developments. The ENISA report was developed in cooperation with the ENISA IoT Security Experts Group and additional key stakeholders. Security recommendations crucial for functionality ENISA defines IoT as “a cyber-physical ecosystem of interconnected sensors and actuators, which enables intelligent decision making”. IoT brings the smart element into every life aspect of Europeans, from smart cars and wearables to smart grids and infrastructures. The threats and risks related to IoT devices, systems and services are growing, and new attacks are covered by the media every day. “The deployment of IoT will be key to our smart cities, smart airports, smart health and smart X. It is envisaged, that IoT will be deployed everywhere and will have a positive impact on our lives. The deployment of baseline security recommendations into our IoT ecosystem will be critical to the proper function of these devices by mitigating and preventing cyber-attacks.”, said Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA. Extremely complex landscape With a great impact on citizens’ safety, security and privacy, the IoT threat landscape is extremely complex. Therefore, it is important to understand what exactly needs to be secured and to implement specific security measures to protect the IoT from cyber threats. This is particularly important in the context of ICT systems, which are either critical infrastructures themselves or essential for the operation of critical infrastructures. The ENISA report provides IoT experts, developers, manufacturers, decision makers and security personnel with a guide to good practices and recommendations on preventing and mitigating cyber-attacks against IoT. Following a horizontal approach, ENISA’s report aims to define a common background between particularities of diverse, vertical IoT application areas with a focus on critical infrastructures. The report builds on the expertise and insight previously gained by ENISA through its sectorial studies on smart infrastructures such as smart homes, smart cities, intelligent public transport, smart cars, smart airports and eHealth (available on ENISA’s website). The recommendations of the report are meant to be of use to all actors involved, from the European Commission and governments to the IoT industry, providers, operators, manufacturers and consumers’ associations. IoT is entering into all aspects all life so there is a need for a strong holistic approach and to: Promote harmonization of IoT security initiatives and regulations; Raise awareness of the need for IoT cybersecurity; Define secure software and hardware development lifecycle guidelines for IoT; Achieve consensus on interoperability across the IoT ecosystem; Foster economic and administrative incentives for IoT security; Establishment of secure IoT product/service lifecycle management; Clarify liability among IoT stakeholders. ENISA’s future work in the field will be focused on enhancing the security and resilience of IoT in Europe, engaging all relevant key stakeholders and providing studies and knowledge to face the upcoming challenges. The baseline security requirements for IoT in critical infrastructures presented in this report can serve as a foundation for further efforts towards a harmonised EU approach to IoT security.

ENISA_NEWS_0375	2017-11-16	NEWS	Lisbon hosts European eHealth cybersecurity conference	" The conference saw the participation of over 600 people and had 30 speakers from all over the European Union. The main topics approached were policy compliance in healthcare, Cloud and cybersecurity, and smart healthcare. ENISA’s experts in network and information security moderated some very interesting discussion panels, such as cybersecurity for healthcare situational analysis and security of medical devices. Under the motto ""cybersecurity is a shared responsibility"", ENISA and EU hospitals representatives discussed about the implications of the NIS Directive. Another discussion topic was the way policy makers are supporting the sector by building capacity (through dedicated Health CSIRTs) and by investing in information sharing (creating dedicated healthcare Information Sharing and Analysis Centres). With regard to network and information security, the Portuguese Ministry of Health presented their national approach towards cybersecurity for healthcare under the NIS Directive. Medical device manufacturers were also engaged in a dialogue on security and safety as prerequisites in creating new devices and how the Internet of Things makes them vulnerable to cyber-attacks. One day prior to the event, ENISA organized a workshop with representatives of some 40 Portuguese hospitals, aimed at raising awareness of the NIS Directive implementation and at collecting feedback on its current status.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0376	2017-11-15	PR	I say ransomware, you say crypto virus: the cyber-insurance language problem	 The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors that influence the harmonization, or lack thereof, of risk assessment language in cyber-insurance, its practical impact on the growth prospects of the cyber-insurance market and forthcoming trends. ‘Recommendations on cyber-insurance’ is based on feedback provided by multiple insurance carriers, brokers and other key industry stakeholders. Its recommendations are intended to support the cyber-insurance industry and policy makers to leverage the key market drivers towards harmonisation of the language used in underwriting and insurance coverage policies. Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, said: “Standardising policy language will help insurers and customers to mutually understand what they are selling and buying and increase buyer understanding and trust in cyber-insurance products.” In spite of the significant overlap in topics examined as part of the insurance companies’ risk assessments, the language used in these documents is yet to be harmonised across the cyber-insurance industry for various reasons. This fact is not in line with other types of insurance (e.g. car insurance). Therefore, this potentially reduces the customers’ appeal for cyber-insurance products and limits the possibility of added value offerings, on top of more or less standardised products. Since customers do not have a common point of reference to better understand and compare products, this may lead to reduced trust towards cyber-insurance offers. The lack of a common risk assessment language may also affect the opportunities and prospects of insurance companies that are currently in the process of entering the market. Through this report, the industry is encouraged to standardise policy language and underwriting questionnaires, to promote data sharing between stakeholders, to develop industry standards, and to build in-house expertise in cybersecurity. Also, the industry is advised to contribute to the collection of data on aggregated loss scenarios, to build offerings around information security and privacy regulations, and to adopt a sectorial approach in harmonising language. Last but not least, the industry should address the needs of the SME market and improve the overall data quality by integrating various heterogeneous sources. On the other hand, the European Union and its Member States’ policy makers are encouraged to create minimum coverage requirements per type of coverage, to leverage the upcoming mandatory incident reporting schemes via the NIS Directive and the GDPR to produce meaningful data, to create a central EU repository of incident data, to increase demand and buyer maturity and to develop guidelines for cyber-insurance. The study also reveals that competition between carriers will shift to pricing and added value offerings. In order to keep up with the impact of evolving technological advancements, this will consequently lead to the acceleration of different levels of innovation. For the industry, harmonisation will simplify the quotation process, leaving a clearer framework for developing cyber-insurance products. The main drivers that are expected to act as catalysts behind the language harmonisation are: the adoption of regulations and standards: will provide the common framework for the harmonization of terminology and offerings; the increasing availability of data: will allow better understanding and modelling of cyber risks; the evolution of the demand side: will create the need for more standardised and easily comparable products; the overall market maturation: will naturally resolve a number of market frictions. ENISA understands the importance of supporting the cyber-insurance market growth without limiting the carriers’ ability to innovate and provides recommendations in this sense. These recommendations were developed by engaging multiple key industry stakeholders via interviews, online surveys and a validation workshop. This report is the latest in a line of studies that ENISA has conducted to provide useful and actionable guidelines to support the effective growth of the cyber-insurance market. Cyber risks are becoming a worldwide priority, so organisations across the globe are looking into cyber-insurance to transfer residual cyber risk. Cyber-insurance can help a company survive a major economic impact from a cybersecurity incident e.g. by compensating for revenue losses due to ransomware. This way, organisations can avoid bankruptcy caused by cyber-attacks. Moreover, the cyber-insurance market is expected to grow from an estimated USD 3 – 4 billion (generated in premiums annually) to USD 20 billion by 2025, making it one of the fastest growing segments of the industry and a huge economic opportunity for the EU. Still, the EU market is considered to be in its early development stages and far from reaching its full potential. This fact is attributed to a number of challenges, among which one of the most important is the lack of harmonisation in the language used by insurers.  For full report: Commonality of risk assessment language in cyber insurance     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0377	2017-11-08	PR	ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht speaks on IoT in front of European Parliament	" “President Juncker’s State of the Union Address, the publication of the new European cybersecurity strategy 2017 and the Cybersecurity Act – which includes a proposal for regulating certification – have clearly shown us that our political leaders are committed to building the future wealth of the EU by leveraging the opportunities of the Digital Society. The European Parliament, together with the EU institutions, the Member States, civil society and industry need to work together, to address all challenges and put in place policies to ensure that our economy is ready to embrace emerging technologies and benefit from the economic and social opportunities from the deployment of IoT”, said Prof. Helmbrecht in the opening of his speech. He continued: “New technologies are changing the cyber-landscape. The IoT is now being deployed with an estimated 20 billion devices expected to be deployed before 2020."" In 2016, the EU cybersecurity market was estimated at EUR 20.1 billion and compares favourably with the cybersecurity market of other global regions. However, the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the EU market is 6%, whereas the average growth rate is around 8%, and is growing slower than all other major regions. We see an increase in monetisation of cybercrime, crime as a service and targeted attacks. According to ENISA’s ‘Threat landscape’ report, in 2016, ransomware was the primary element for the manifestation of monetization of the activities of cyber-criminals, with an estimated loss of USD 1 billion for the entire year 2016. More recently, the ransomware campaign, which became known as the WannaCry Outburst, caused chaos due to its massive distribution, affecting more than 150 countries and infecting over 230.000 systems. Cyber-space can be used for sabotage, espionage and warfare. Hybrid warfare is evolving without necessary using the words ‘war’ in describing the attacks."" Prof. Dr. Helmbrecht also made a firm statement: “Unless Europe substantially improves its approach to cybersecurity, the risk of a significant impact on our lives continues to increase. However, cybersecurity should not only be seen as a negative obstacle but as an opportunity to promote a new generation of products and services that are made and/or delivered in Europe, with security by design as a central component of the products and services.” ENISA’s Executive Director spoke about the current process of strengthening the Agency through the EU Commission’s proposal, which is now being considered by the Council of the EU and the European Parliament. He also emphasised that the Network and Information Security Directive, which comes into force in 2018, places requirements on operators of essential services and digital service providers to have a minimum level of cybersecurity in their networks and to report on certain levels of incidents. Executive Director Helmbrecht concluded the hearing by stating: “Our job is to maximise opportunities whilst keeping the risks under control. As the EU Cybersecurity Agency, ENISA will support this process and will work together with policy makers and industry to make sure that cybersecurity is an enabler of, and not a barrier to, economic progress.” The full speech of Prof. Dr. Helmbrecht is available here.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0383	2017-10-20	NEWS	Vulnerability of Wi-Fi WPA2 networks	 Every time a vulnerability affects the security of a network or a cryptographic protocol, a wide range of devices or services are potentially put at risk.This vulnerability enables an attacker to modify the protocol’s handshake, which can essentially lead to intercepting the internet traffic of a Wi-Fi network. Also, depending on the network configuration, the attacker could inject and/or manipulate data without owning or breaking its password security.The affected devices such as smart devices, Internet of Things (IoT), routers etc. might never receive a patch addressing the issue.A potential attacker who is in the physical proximity of a protected Wi-Fi network and carries out this attack performs a ‘man-in-the-middle’ attack. The attacker can essentially intercept or decrypt internet traffic without owning any passwords or cryptographic keys. Therefore, changing the Wi-Fi password would not be of help.The EU Cybersecurity Agency ENISA has collected and analysed information on this situation and has issued a cybersecurity info note. This provides a comprehensive overview of the event and key recommendations on how to proceed in case people and organizations are affected.Despite the fact that this vulnerability is present in the Wi-Fi standard and thus affects a very large number of devices, Wi-Fi users should not panic. This issue can be resolved through software and firmware updates.While waiting for manufacturers to prepare and push patches for their devices, you should either apply the available security measures or to use the 4G mobile internet connection deliver by your carrier instead of a Wi-Fi connection.For each of your Wi-Fi enabled devices, check with the manufacturer or vendor and apply patches as soon as they become available. Also, apply security measures on different layers. For example, use only HTTPS websites and trusted Virtual Private Network (VPN) providers. If you’re an organization, you should separate your wireless network from the enterprise, wired networks.All EU Member States regulatory authorities are aware of the seriousness of the situation. They have issued warnings, alerts or other relevant information that include also recommendations for end users.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0384	2017-10-19	PR	The Internet of Things: when your washing machine and blood pressure monitor become a target for cyberattacks	 With at least 20 billion devices expected to be connected to the internet by 2020, the Internet of Things (IoT) is here to stay. While it has many undeniable positive effects, the threats and risks related to the IoT are manifold and they evolve rapidly. For this reason, ENISA and Europol joined forces to tackle these security challenges by organising a dedicated two-day conference on 18 and 19 October 2017, which was attended by more than 250 participants from the private sector, security community, law enforcement, the European Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT) community and academia. The Internet of Things is a wide and diverse ecosystem where interconnected devices and services collect, exchange and process data in order to adapt dynamically to a context. In simpler words, it makes our cameras, televisions, washing machines and heating systems ‘smart’ and creates new opportunities for the way we work, interact and communicate, and how devices react and adapt to us. It is important to understand how these connected devices need to be secured and to develop and implement adequate security measures to protect the Internet of Things from cyber threats. Beyond technical measures, the adoption of IoT has raised many new legal, policy and regulatory challenges, broad and complex in scope. In order to address these challenges, cooperation across different sectors and among different stakeholders is essential. The risk of criminals ‘weaponising’ insecure IoT devices was already identified in the 2014 and 2015 editions of Europol’s Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessments and in ENISA’s 2016 Threat Landscape Report. It became a reality at the end of 2016 with several DDoS attacks of unprecedented scale originating from the Mirai botnet. It must be assumed that cybercriminals will develop new variants and enlarge the variety of IoT devices affected by this type of malware. This joint Europol-ENISA conference, the first one on the topic, provided the opportunity for all the relevant stakeholders to come together, discuss the challenges faced and identify possible solutions, building on existing initiatives and frameworks. A specific focus was on the role of law enforcement in responding to the criminal abuse of the IoT. The two-day meeting was testimony to the willingness of all the relevant international actors to ensure that the many benefits of the IoT can be fully realised by jointly addressing the security challenges and combating the criminal abuse of such devices, ultimately making cyberspace a safer place for all. The main conclusions of the conference are: The need for more cooperation and multi-stakeholder engagement to address interoperability, as well as security and safety issues especially in light of emerging developments like industry 4.0, autonomous vehicles, and the advent of 5G. As securing the end device is often technically difficult and expensive to achieve, the focus should therefore be on securing the architecture and underlying infrastructure, creating trust and security across different networks and domains. There is a need to create stronger incentives to address the security issues related to the IoT. This requires achieving an optimal balance between opportunity and risk in a market where high scalability and short time-to-market dominate, positioning security as a distinctive commercial advantage and putting it at the heart of the design and development process. To effectively and efficiently investigate the criminal abuse of the IoT, deterrence is another dimension that needs strong cooperation between law enforcement, the CSIRT community, the security community as well as the judiciary. This creates an urgent need for law enforcement to develop the technical skills and expertise to fight IoT-related cybercrime successfully. These efforts need to be complemented by raising end users’ awareness of the security risks of IoT devices. Leveraging existing initiatives and frameworks, a multi-pronged approach combining and complementing actions at legislation, regulation and policy, standardisation, certification/labelling and technical level is required to secure the IoT ecosystem. One of the key observations of the conference is the importance of baseline good practices in addressing these IoT security challenges. In the coming months ENISA will publish its “Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT” report, bridging the gap in the area. Europol’s Executive Director Rob Wainwright commented:  “Cybercriminals are quick to adapt to and exploit new technologies. They come up with new ways to victimise and affect people’s lives and invade their privacy, either by collecting or manipulating personal data or by virtually breaking into smart homes. The Internet of Things is not only here to stay but expected to significantly expand as more and more households, cities and industries become connected. Insecure IoT devices are increasingly becoming tools for conducting cyber criminality. We need to act now and work together to solve the security challenges that come with the IoT and to ensure the full potential.” ENISA’s Executive Director Professor Dr Udo Helmbrecht also commented: “The IoT revolution is beginning to transform our personal lives and the infrastructures that we use on a regular basis such as smart homes, smart energy and smart health. Manufacturers and operators of these devices need to ensure that security by design has been incorporated into their selection and their deployment. ENISA is pleased to be working closely with Europol to inform key stakeholders of the important role that the IoT is taking on and the need to be aware of the cybersecurity and criminal aspects associated with deploying and using these devices”.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0385	2017-10-18	NEWS	ENISA meets cyber-experts to plan Cyber Europe 2018	 Some 40 experts from national cybersecurity authorities met on 17 and 18 October at ENISA’s premises in Athens to discuss about and agree upon the core plan and scenario of next year’s Cyber Europe exercise. The fruitful discussions held are key in the process of developing another successful exercise plan within the Cyber Europe series. Since 2010, the EU cybersecurity agency ENISA has been responsible for organising the pan-European exercise called Cyber Europe every two years. Cyber Europe is a series of cyber-incident and crisis management exercises destined to both public and private sectors within the European Union and EFTA Member States. These exercises are simulations of large-scale cybersecurity incidents that escalate into cyber crises. The exercises offer the participants opportunities to analyse advanced technical cybersecurity incidents, crisis management and strategic communication between member states.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0386	2017-10-17	NEWS	Sixth ENISA-EC3 Workshop on CSIRT and international law enforcement cooperation for a safer Europe	 This year’s headline was cooperation between European Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and law enforcement. Fighting attacks on information systems, preventing harm and protecting critical infrastructure are part of a security continuum, which has grown in scope and influence, evolving into an ecosystem composed of many different entities that all partake in and impact operations and the development of the field. It is increasingly evident that these parties need to join forces, work together and collaborate on cyber security issues. The ultimate goal is to consolidate trust among the various sectors involved in the ecosystem in order to enable a meaningful exchange of data, intelligence and information on threats: law enforcement, private-sector partners and CSIRTs are key elements of this ecosystem and they require a workable collaboration framework that empowers them to collectively face the ever-increasing threats from cyber-attacks. The workshop took place at Europol’s headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands, and brought together the CSIRTs from EU Member States, EFTA countries and their national law enforcement counterparts. It focused on the need for improved cooperation and for an effective and concerted response to the growing attacks against information systems. The participants addressed very important topics in the current cyber landscape: information sharing and operational cooperation. They were also presented with the key findings of two flagship reports, ENISA’s Threat Landscape and Europol’s Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA). Other subjects discussed included the NIS Directive, CSIRTs network, the renewed EU Cybersecurity Strategy, the role of encryption, forensic and investigative techniques, as well as legal, practical and technical challenges that specialists face and how to better overcome them. Through this workshop, participants were given the opportunity to constructively discuss the strengths and challenges of their cooperation and to share best practices, with the aim of improving cross-sector cooperation to the face the growing challenges in the cyber security ecosystem. The 2017 Wannacry and NotPetya attacks have been the largest and the fastest-spreading ransomware attacks observed so far. Their unprecedented level of reach and potential harm to the victims highlighted the need for effective mechanisms to be in place to efficiently respond to the attacks and identify the culprits. There is therefore a need to strengthen the coordinated CSIRT and law enforcement response to cybercrime in the EU and thus to help protect European citizens, businesses and governments from online crime.       Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0400	2017-09-19	NEWS	Consideration on ICT security certification in Europe	" Over the last years, ENISA has engaged in a number of activities in pursuit of supporting the Commission and the Member States in identifying a way forward on the certification of ICT security products and services, which on the one hand seeks to boost competition and on the other to promote mutual recognition or harmonisation of certification practices up to a certain level. An EU-wide survey on the topic of ICT Security Certification has been singled out as a suitable instrument to consult with stakeholders and seek structured feedback against the currently envisaged policy options. The findings of the survey have served as input to COM(2017)477 - Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on ENISA, the ""EU Cybersecurity Agency"", and repealing Regulation (EU) 526/2013, and on Information and Communication Technology cybersecurity certification (''Cybersecurity Act'') Link to the survey report: Consideration on ICT security certification in Europe-Survey Report     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0401	2017-09-13	PR	European Commission proposal on a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the future of ENISA	" Jean-Claude Juncker in his State of the Union Speech this morning has confirmed a European Commission proposal for a Regulation on the future of ENISA called the “Cybersecurity Act”. In this context, the new proposed mandate reinforces ENISA role and enables the Agency to better support the Member States in implementing the NIS Directive and to counter particular threats more actively by becoming a centre of expertise on cybersecurity certification. It is proposed that the current role of ENISA should be strengthened in the many areas where the Agency is already providing added value, and new areas where support is needed will be added, in particular the NIS Directive, the review of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy, the upcoming EU Cybersecurity Blueprint for cyber crisis cooperation and ICT security certification. Two of the new key areas where the Agency would play an important role are Cybersecurity crisis management and Cybersecurity certification and standardization of ICT products and services. In addition, for the Agency to perform the tasks and achieve the objectives set in the proposal it should have a permanent mandate which would allow for a more strategic and longer term planning and thus enabling for a better preparedness to tackle the future challenges. Speaking on the eve of the Tallinn Cyber Security Conference the Executive Director of ENISA Professor Dr. Udo Helmbrecht welcomed the proposal from the Commission on the draft Regulation for the renewal of the mandate of ENISA. “I welcome the proposal from the Commission to strengthen and expand ENISA’s mandate by addressing certification and standardisation of ICT products and better cooperation in relating to preparing and addressing cross border cybersecurity challenges in Europe. I believe that these initiatives will improve the Digital Single Market and strengthen the ICT industry in Europe. The proposal forms a good basis for the upcoming discussions with the Council and Parliament on the future of the Regulation for ENISA and the building of a stronger cybersecurity framework for Europe”.

ENISA_NEWS_0405	2017-08-25	NEWS	NCSC published factsheet on Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)	 In order to observe malicious digital activities within an organisation, Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are a valuable asset. With IoCs, organisations can gain quick insights at central points in the network into malicious digital activities. When your organisation observes these activities, it is important to know what you can do to trace back which system is infected. Obtain as much contextual information with an IoC as possible, so that you get a clear picture of what is happening and how serious this is. It is important to share IoCs between organisations. By doing so, other organisations will be able to defend themselves against similar incidents. With the TLP classification you define with whom information may be shared and how the recipients may or may not share the information further. This factsheet describes how you can monitor for IoCs within your organisation and which steps you take when an IoC generates a hit. This factsheet also describes how to deal with confidentiality of IoCs and how you can create IoCs yourself.

ENISA_NEWS_0412	2017-07-03	NEWS	EU operational cooperation under test for the second time	 For the second time in less than 2 months the EU CSIRTs Network has responded to the recent global outbreak of ‘NotPetya’ campaign that has also affected Europe. Since Tuesday, 27th June 2017, a malware outbreak has been infecting IT systems mostly in Europe. News agencies across the globe compared this attack with the recent WannaCry ransomware outburst which shocked the world in May 2017. However there were differences like the attack's initial vector. In the case of WannaCry it was plain exploitation of SMB vulnerabilities while now Microsoft has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate MEDoc tax accounting updater process. By utilising effective channels of communications, EU MS CSIRTs have managed to exchange information in a secure and prompt manner. This has resulted in a synchronised cross-border information flow, fast incident response on national level, and better recognition and understanding of the threat and mitigation measures. ENISA has once again actively supported MS CSIRTs on this mission. The successful cooperation among MS CSIRTs has been driven by the current Estonian Presidency of the Council of the EU in a close cooperation with ENISA and other volunteering MS CSIRTs. This adhoc collaboration effort showed good progress in building trust and operational cooperation among EU MS CSIRTs. Current Chair of the CSIRTs network, CERT-EE, presents today the operational update and situation overview of the 'NotPetya' campaign on behalf of the CSIRTs network at the Horizontal Working Party on Cyber Security Issues meeting in Brussels. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, said: “For the second time within two months, the world is faced with a major global cyber-attack.  ENISA is once again closely monitoring the situation and working together with the Member States CSIRTs to respond to the cyber attack thereby helping to manage the cybersecurity of European citizens and businesses.”     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0413	2017-06-30	PR	Cyber Europe 2016: Key lessons from a simulated cyber crisis	 While a new ransomware campaign (Petya) is still ongoing, and a few weeks only after the WannaCry outbreak, the report sheds light on the preparatory steps taken by authorities and industry to respond to such cyber attacks. Over 1 000 participants from all 28 EU Member States, along with Switzerland and Norway, joined last year in a simulated crisis which lasted for over 6 months, culminating in a 48‑hour event on 13 and 14 October 2016. Leveraging a newly developed exercise environment containing dozens of simulated news outlets, TV channels, search engines and social media platforms, the immersion in the exercise was unprecedented. The EU Ombudsman underlined this forward-looking outlook in March 2017 with an award for excellence in innovation and transformation. Yet the most striking evidence of such innovation, and certainly a reward in itself for all those who worked hard on the exercise at ENISA and in Member States, was the countless similarities between the scenario and the WannaCry outbreak. Cyber Europe 2016 proved to be an excellent opportunity to prepare for the real incident to come. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, said: “Cyberattacks are increasingly, simultaneously affecting more than one Member State. The true value of ENISA’s Cyber Europe 2016 is that it simulates cyber incidents that test and develop the Member States’ capability to work together and address cyber incidents that have a cross border perspective. The simulations are particularly useful in that they are designed to test technical, operational, public relations and political responses to cross border cyber incidents. The recent WannaCry incident demonstrated the need for Member States to work together, share information and respond to the incident in a coordinated and effective manner. ENISA has for many years led in the delivery of cyber exercises that pursue these goals. I would like to thank all the Member States for their full participation in these exercises and I look forward to starting the next exercise that will build on the good and positive experience achieved in this exercise. Next steps The immediate future of cyber crisis management in the EU concerns the drafting of a cyber crisis cooperation plan and the development of a cyber crisis management platform. While the role of ENISA in both activities is essential, the effective cooperation of all EU cybersecurity actors involved will determine their success. In addition, preparations for Cyber Europe 2018 have already started. Remark If you have participated in Cyber Europe 2016, please contact your national authorities: a detailed report is available.

ENISA_PR_0417	2017-06-16	PR	Malware causes for the first time the longest lasting incidents in Telecoms sector according to new ENISA report	" The Annual Incidents report 2016 provides an aggregated analysis of incidents affecting the availability of services reported to ENISA and the European Commission under Article 13a, by the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) of the different EU Member States. Most incidents reported in 2016 involved mobile internet and mobile telephony connections, while the longest lasting incidents were caused for the first time by malware. This year ENISA and the European Commission received 158 incident reports from NRAs regarding severe outages in the EU’s electronic communication networks and/or services which occurred in 2016. In total 24 countries, including two EFTA countries, reported significant incidents, while 6 countries reported they had no significant incidents. In general, there was a slight increase compared to last year’s statistics where reported incidents reached a total number of 138 incident reports. Key findings from this year’s incident reporting include: Mobile internet continues to be the most affected service: In 2016 most incidents affected mobile internet (48% of all reported incidents). System failures are the dominant root cause of incidents: Most incidents were caused by system failures or technical failures (almost 73% of the incidents) as a root cause. Malware is causing increasingly long lasting incidents: Incidents caused by malware, although there were not too many of them, had most impact in terms of duration and user hours lost. Emergency services are affected by incidents: Same as last year, 20 % of the incidents affected the 112 emergency services. Third party failures continue to affect a considerable part of the total number of incidents: 21.5% of all incidents were caused by third party failures, a significant increase from last year (15,2%). ENISA’s Executive Director, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, said: “This publication offers a unique insight into the resilience of Telecoms networks across Europe. Given the criticality of Telecoms networks to our daily lives it is important that ENISA reports on the monitoring of the resilience of these networks by the Telecom operators on a pan EU level and that we all learn from the previous years' experience. "" The annual report is a result of an EU wide incident reporting process which started in 2012, under Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC).The aim of the incident reporting scheme is not only to give an overview of services and network assets impacted and the root causes of the incidents but also to provide transparency to society and to learn from past incidents in the electronic communications sector in order to systematically improve the security of the networks and services. For the full report: Annual Incident Reports 2016 For a comparative analysis of all the years of incident reporting: Annual Incident Reports 2016 - Annex Background: ENISA is permanently analysing the current threat environment and undertakes studies that address particular technical or policy related topics directly linked to the electronic communications sector. In the context of Article13a efforts, ENISA has been drafting recommendations for trending issues such as power supply dependencies and cable cuts caused by mistakes in order to provide a holistic and in-depth view to providers that need to assess risks, take appropriate security measures, and report about significant security incidents. A group of experts from NRAs, called Article 13a Expert Group, meets with ENISA periodically -several times a year- to develop technical guidelines and to discuss the implementation of Article 13a (for example, on how to supervise the electronic communications sector) and to share knowledge and exchange views about past incidents, and how to address them.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0419	2017-06-15	NEWS	New cyber security information service launched today by ENISA	" “Cyber Security Info Notes” are short papers produced by ENISA on information security topics, which aim at highlighting assessed facts regarding information security related incidents and developments. The main focus is on providing an independent and ‘calm’ opinion and on advising stakeholders targeted by these incidents/developments. The philosophy and goals of the Agency’s information service are to provide an expert point of view that is not driven by urgency. “Cyber Security Info Notes” deliver a neutral, balanced and comprehensive point of view, together with recommendations. This work consists of a synthesis of both publicly available material and own experience. ENISA has updated and enhanced its existing “Info Notes” service with the aim of producing useful information for its stakeholder communities based on all of the Agency’s work. The content covers a wide range of cybersecurity information e.g. vulnerabilities, threats, incidents, developments etc. In addition ENISA aims to establish context out of security information. This contribution will be achieved by putting current events, incidents and news into the context of internal and external work. ENISA’s Cyber Security Info Notes will be published on a regular basis (1-2 per month) and on a per request basis such as during the event of important cyber security incidents. For more information visit ENISA’s Cyber Security Info Notes section. “Disinformation operations in cyber-space” The first Cyber Security Info Note titled “Disinformation operations in cyber-space” outlines the emergence of disinformation campaigns in cyber-space. In the context of disinformation operations, the note provides an overview of the trending threat of ""tainted leaks"" and depicts the mitigation approach used against a recent disinformation campaign.

ENISA_NEWS_0420	2017-06-12	NEWS	CSIRT maturity evaluation process - How is CSIRT maturity assessed?	" CSIRTs will find in ENISA's new report a comprehensive overview about assessment parameters which was also translated into an online survey tool for a direct maturity self-assessment.The CSIRT maturity improvement process includes a survey with questions and answers for all the parameters of the commonly used SIM3 (Security Incident Management Maturity Model) model, which makes it considerably easier for any CSIRT team to self-assess their maturity in the terms of SIM3. The survey is complete with a mapping to the proposed CSIRT maturity scale (with the steps basic, intermediate and certifiable), so that a team member who use the survey can self-assess their maturity on that scale.As an additional element of the evaluation process ENISA suggests a peer review methodology. A methodology for how to do peer reviews between trusted teams, complementary to the self-assessment approach and intended as a form  of intra-community mutual support aimed at further enhancing all teams' maturity. The proposed peer review approach is a flexible one, that is expected to suit the needs of all teams involved. For the full report: Study on CSIRT Maturity – Evaluation Process For the survey tool (beta version): CSIRT Maturity - Self-assessment Survey Background:The EU Network and Information Security Directive  (NISD) creates a CSIRTs network ""to contribute to developing confidence and trust between the Member States and to promote swift and effective operational cooperation"". The Directive states that each Member State shall designate one or more CSIRTs which shall comply with the requirements set out in point (1) of Annex I (requirements), covering at least the sectors referred to in Annex II and the services referred to in Annex III, responsible for risk and incident handling in accordance with a well-defined process. The Directive gives high-level requirements that designated CSIRTs must observe, and tasks that they must perform.ENISA has carried out a considerable amount of work in the CSIRT area, and this work contributes by sharping the role of ENISA in helping CSIRTs on their way to a higher maturity level. With this new practical guide CSIRTs will be better prepared to protecttheir constituencies and improve team's maturity.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0424	2017-05-22	PR	ENISA works together with European semiconductor industry on key cybersecurity areas	 The EU Agency for Network and Information security – ENISA – together with industry recently reached a common position on cybersecurity, that reflects the concerns of industry and provides a set of suggestions for policy makers. The paper focuses on four main areas actively debated at the EU level: standardisation and certification, security processes and services, security requirements and implementation, and the economic dimensions. The paper identifies key challenges and recommendations identified for the European Commission to: define a policy framework for ensuring minimal security requirements for connected devices. The development of European security standards needs to become more efficient and/or adapted to new circumstances related to Internet of Things (IoT). Based on those requirements, a European scheme for certification and the development of an associated trust label should be evaluated. ensure that reliable security processes and services are being developed to support industry in implementing security features in their products (e.g. through providing information and training about state-of-the art security solutions). encourage the development of mandatory staged requirements for security and privacy in the IoT, including some minimal requirements. These common principles should be considered in future revisions and new legislative initiatives. create a level playing field for cybersecurity and look into incentives similar to the Digital Security Bonus in order to reward the use of good security practices. ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht said: “Trusted solutions and a common defined level for the security and privacy of connected and smart devices is both recommended and needed, to allow Europe to reap the benefits of soon to become ubiquitous technologies. As such, standardisation and certification have been identified as a priority, to accelerate the level playing field for the entire industry and reflect the trust of citizens, consumers and businesses in the connected environment”. “Pervasive connectivity over the Internet of Things means that security is becoming an important issue for just about all citizens – whether they be using a computing device, TV or washing machine. The European policy framework is set to define easy-to-use measures that will give industry the guidance it requires and consumers the transparency they need,” said Dr. Stefan Hofschen, Division President Chip Card & Security at Infineon Technologies. “On the product side, security solutions based on certified, hardware security trust anchors are already available today to serve the increasing security requirements.”  “The growth in IoT and connected devices creates a tremendous amount of opportunity for businesses and consumers. How the industry comes together, agrees on common principles to address complex concerns like security, can break down the barriers of adoption and is key to fostering this market,” said Rüdiger Stroh, ‎Executive Vice President & General Manager of Security and Connectivity at NXP® Semiconductors. “Security and privacy by design, a proven approach that grew business streams for mobile phones, cars and wearable manufacturers, help build trust between businesses and consumers. Our vision is to help grow the IoT market and bring this quality of security to other IoT applications.”    “This initiative will increase the much-needed awareness for security in IoT devices and organize a collective effort to establish important standards to help deliver it, which will ultimately bring big benefits to consumers and businesses,” said Marie-France Florentin Group Vice President & General Manager of Secure Microcontroller Division at STMicroelectronics. “With its long history and valuable expertise in embedded security, ST is in a strong position to make vital contributions to this key framework.” The common position was developed by Infineon, NXP, and STMicroelectronics, supported by ENISA. The Agency aims at working further with industry and seeks the support of more actors in the semi-conductor and chip-product manufacturer field, application and service providers. Furthermore, ENISA is working alongside the Commission and cooperates with the recently formed cPPP (contractual Public-Private Partnership) in order to define a roadmap on NIS Certification, and looks forward to supporting the Commission in the NIS Certification policy area.

ENISA_PR_0426	2017-05-15	PR	WannaCry Ransomware: First ever case of cyber cooperation at EU level	 As of Friday 12 May 2017, multiple variants of a ransomware named WannaCry have been spreading globally, affecting hundreds of thousands of users, organizations, including users in the European Union. It is understood that the cyber attack is focussed on Microsoft Windows based operating systems. Udo HELMBRECHT, Executive Director of ENISA, said “as the European Cybersecurity Agency, we are closely monitoring the situation and working around the clock with our stakeholders to ensure the security of European citizens and businesses, and the stability of the Digital Single Market. We are reporting on the evolution of the attacks to the European Commission and liaising with our partners in the European Union CSIRT Network”. ENISA and several European Member States are currently working together to assess the situation at European level.  A dedicated taskforce has been set up at ENISA to support what is the first ever case of cyber cooperation at EU level in that the EU Standard Operating Procedures, developed by ENISA and the Member States, are currently being used to this end. What makes this event unusual is that this attack impacted many organisations across the world in short period of time. Recent estimates, at this point in time, suggest that approximately 190,000 computers in over 150 countries have been affected. European Critical infrastructure operators (health, energy, transport, finance and telecoms), manufacturers and service providers have been affected. This malware also affected computers used for dedicated tasks such as robotics, information display systems or medical scanners. A number of car manufacturing plants in the UK, France, Romania and Slovenia have already indicated that their production lines are affected by this malware. The ransomware prevents access by encrypting multiple common file types such as documents, images and videos, asks for a ransom and distributes automatically. The key characteristic of this attack is a fast propagation leveraging a known critical vulnerability affecting Microsoft Windows systems, exploited by the ransomware without user interaction. ENISA understands that at this point in time users who are using the latest version of the windows operating system and have their software up to date are not affected by this attack. Users affected by ransomware are generally presented with a message on the screen indicating that their computer systems and or files have been blocked and that the files will be unblocked if a ransom is paid. Payment is often requested to be made using bitcoin as an attempt to effect a money transfer in an anonymous way. This type of cyber-attack does not generally involve the stealing of personal data. The compromise can be displayed in a number of ways including Not being able to access your files Access to certain operational programs being blocked Analysis of the malware by ENISA, indicates that different encryption keys are generated for different files. In this regard the malware is relatively sophisticated. ENISA’s experts continue to analyse the ransomware to advise Member States in order to raise awareness of this particular case. Ransomware attacks are generally successful when an internet user opens an email with an attachment containing malware. Other methods involve a web users visiting a compromised web site where activating a link on the web site can result in malware being downloaded onto the user’s computer. In this particular case the infection vector involves targeting vulnerable computers with identified open ports. No action was required by the user to become infected. ENISA recommendations If your systems have not been hit by the ransomware, you are recommended to apply the following actions as soon as possible: Back-up your files Patch your system with the latest Microsoft’s patch Update your Antivirus to the latest version Consider adding a rule on your router or firewall to block incoming traffic to ports that are not necessary. As with all types of security there is no guarantee and users are recommended to follow best practice to minimise the risk of attack. Users are advised that payment of the ransom does not guarantee that the user will receive the code to decrypt their files or that their computers will be restored to its proper function. Affected users are advised to seek expert assistance and to contact law enforcement personnel to report the crime.

Vice-President for the Digital Single Market Andrus Ansip said: “We see an increase in cybercrime; and the use of small devices and targeted attacks affecting businesses and infrastructures. European industry, governments and citizens should have access to competitive secure and trustworthy products and services. We have presented yesterday the mid-term review of the Digital Single Market where cybersecurity is a key priority. The Commission will review the EU cybersecurity strategy and propose a new ENISA mandate in 2017. As part of this approach, the Commission is also working on cyber security certification and labelling to make the EU digital environment safer"". ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht said: “The cyber landscape has changed fundamentally. EU integration has accelerated and our future economic success is built on the concept of an increasingly integrated market that includes digital, finance, energy, transport. There is now a greater risk that cyber incidents will have an impact in more than one Member State. Today, more than ever there is a place for a European body such ENISA to be positioned with a cyber security mandate that is resourced to address the cyber challenges of today and tomorrow, and which facilitates and compliments the activities of Member States towards harmonisation while supporting cost-efficiently the digital single market”.

ENISA_NEWS_0431	2017-04-20	NEWS	'Secure the communications of mail servers'- new factsheet by NCSC	 Traditionally, connections between mail servers have hardly been secured. STARTTLS is an extension to provide existing protocols with connection security. If you only use STARTTLS to secure connections between mail servers, this will protect against so-called passive attackers. An active attacker can easily undo the use of STARTTLS. The DANE protocol allows you to verifiably indicate that your server offers a secure connection. The NCSC recommends enabling STARTTLS and DANE for all your organisation’s incoming and outgoing email traffic. The National Council Digital Government has decided in September 2016 to include STARTTLS and DANE for email traffic in the list of compulsory open standards. Therefore, it is compulsory for Dutch government bodies to apply these standards when investing in email systems. The standards STARTTLS and DANE are also part of the initiative 'Secure E-mail Coalition', a partnership of businesses, trade associations and governments. This initiative is aimed at broader adoption of email security and up-to-date standards. This factsheet supports organisations that want to start using these standards.

ENISA_PR_0435	2017-03-21	PR	ENISA 4th Industry event aims to stimulate cybersecurity SMEs and access to funding mechanisms 	 The primary goal of this first event in 2017 was to engage the SME community operating in the cybersecurity domain on best practices and measures to ensure understanding and access to appropriate funding mechanisms, including both public sector funding (such as Horizon 2020, cPPP (contractual public-private partnership) and ECSO initiatives) and private sector funding (such as venture capital and crowdfunding). ENISA’s Head of Core Operations, Dr Steve Purser explained: “The objective of this year’s event is to jointly define clear and accessible actions and possible next steps that will contribute to developing the full potential of SMEs representing the EU cyber industry. Working with an array of public and private players it is critical to enhance the level of understanding cybersecurity innovators such as SMEs have, in terms of funding mechanisms”. One of the identified challenges of setting up a robust cyber security industry in the EU, concerns the difficulties European based SMEs face to enter and exploit existing funding mechanisms. ENISA along with representatives from DG Connect, DG GROW, DG Region, ESCO and the private sector discussed this challenge with an audience composed primarily of EU based SMEs with the aim to identify pragmatic solutions. The event addressed private and public funding of innovative cybersecurity solutions in an effort to close the gap between the innovative strength derived from outwards looking enterprises and financial support provided by public and private funding mechanisms. Different solutions such as venture capital, corporate mentoring, geographical clustering, and innovative means of funding were addressed in an attempt to identify the most profitable steps forward. Innovative industry in network and information security is often hampered in its efforts to scale up operations due to a perceived lack of readily available funding to support them in the early phases of development. In 2015 a survey revealed that 75% of respondents to a public consultation on cybersecurity felt they lacked sufficient access to financial resources to finance cybersecurity projects and initiatives.[1] Some conclusions of the event were: There is a lack of EU financing instruments of disruptive product development initiatives introduced by SMEs. Perhaps the funding instruments presented during the event by DG GROWTH and REGIO may help to this direction. ENISA could potentially play the role of the broker for European SME is seek of EU funding providing them with advice and guidance. EU funding should not only be restricted to the development of innovative technologies but extend to cover also the implementation and use of innovative technologies. Europe needs a blueprint concept of a secure architecture for Europe. There is the need to map the technologies that are available in Europe that fit the blueprint.  ENISA may play the role of best practices collection point. Certification may prove to be an opportunity or an economic impediment to European SMEs. The introduction of a labelling scheme was considered by some participants as of importance to the viability of SMEs in Europe. Government procurement may be an opportunity for European SMEs. It is often the case that cyber security is only a part of a larger public tender making it difficult in such a context for a European SME specialising on Network and Information Security (NIS) to apply. SME success stories if defined in terms of EU market digital sovereignty are quite low.   Background: The concept behind ENISA’s events is to build an effective industry and cybersecurity community by actively involving public and private cyber security partners in the EU network and information security (NIS) industry. Past editions of the industry event focused on the common industry knowledge within the NIS sector, and on matching supply and demand for cybersecurity products and services within the e-health and the financial sector.

ENISA_NEWS_0437	2017-03-15	NEWS	Gaps in NIS standardisation: Mapping the requirements of the NIS Directive to specific standards	 The aim of the study is to provide a mapping of the technical requirements of the NIS Directive to existing standards, to identify gaps and overlaps in related standardisation and provide recommendations for the future work in this area. The report identifies a relatively small number of gaps and areas of overlap in standardisation where there is no clear best practice to be adopted partly due to the diversity of the current standardisation ecosystem. This allows for several recommendations: a)      It is recommended that the European Commission adopt a standards based framework for the exchange of threat and defensive measure information, that impacts the functioning of Network Information Infrastructure (NII), with the support of the Member States pursuant to the NIS Directive. The capabilities from this framework underscore NII as a Critical Infrastructure of the EU and its Member States and can further act a manual and reference point. b)     ENISA urges to adopt open standards in threat exchange. This translates into increased interoperability and improved cooperation and information sharing. In this context, the risk analysis and defensive measures capabilities defined in current standards should be extended, to allow Member States to address the Network Information Infrastructure and NIS provisions necessary to mitigate risk both at a national and regional level. c)      At another level, it will be useful to highlight the similarities between the USA Cybersecurity Act and the NIS Directive and promote possible synergies in the application of standards. The publication coincides with the announcement of the European Commission’s Rolling Plan for ICT Standardisation, which aims at providing a bridge between EU policies and standardisation activities in the area of ICT.

ENISA_NEWS_0443	2017-02-10	NEWS	ENISA study on the security aspects of virtualization	 The final objective is to provide the basis to understand the main issues and challenges related to the security in virtualization, and provide a look at common best practices to implement a secure virtualised environment. Virtualization, is referred to as the set of activities aimed to create a virtual version of real components including, computer-hardware platforms, operating systems, storage, and networking. It is present nowadays at the basis of server and desktop infrastructures, cloud computing, networking, and containerization. Virtualized environments are pervasively adopted and therefore increasingly becoming targets of cyber-attacks. More and more elaborated and specialized attacks are currently devised to exploit vulnerabilities and weaknesses at the virtualization layer. The recent and widespread adoption of virtualization technologies has changed the traditional view of ICT, as virtualization can provide a dramatic increase in the efficiency and effectiveness of complex organizations and communities. It is also expected to constitute an important technological pillar of a thriving data-driven economy and the European single digital market. However, virtualization technologies bear a number of different security risks, some of them shared with traditional computing environments including issues affecting operating systems, communication protocols, and applications, which can be even exacerbated by the presence of virtualized components, producing a greater security impact.  On the other side, virtualization also introduces a number of specific security issues requiring ad hoc solutions.

ENISA_NEWS_0445	2017-02-09	NEWS	Analysis of security measures deployed by e-communication providers	 This document focuses on the security measures providers have deployed to protect networks for the provision of services, and equally important, for the personal and operational data of their customers. The report is targeted primarily at e-communication providers, and at a second level, to National Regulatory Authorities as members of ENISA’s Article 13a Experts Group. Most of the providers, report a very good level of using ENISA recommendations on security requirements, while virtually all providers have deployed a good level of basic security controls. In some security domains, the level of maturity reported, is high as well as the sophistication of implemented controls. It is important that providers of electronic communications take the appropriate measures to address major security concerns. A key conclusion seems to be that while all IT security basics are covered, the achievement of the next level of maturity is impeded mostly by lack of sustainability mechanisms, i.e. repeatable processes and the regularly maintained documentation. The main recommendation for the providers - based on the reported deployment of security measures - is to pay additional attention to sustainability and efficiency. This is best achieved by the adoption of Service Management frameworks and creating a series of processes that include measurement and periodic reviews of security controls and capabilities in all domains.

ENISA_PR_0446	2017-02-08	PR	ENISA Threat Landscape 2016 report: cyber-threats becoming top priority	 This year is characterised by numerous serious cyber-incidents which have dominated the news. Main objectives of malicious activities detected was monetization and political impact. ETL 2016 is streamlined towards the top cyber-threats, providing information on threat agents and attack vectors including all the remarkable developments, trends and issues. Moreover, it reports about threat agents their motivations, and how their practices, tools and techniques have advanced. Though the defenders have made significant progress in disrupting cyber-threats and in the attribution of incidents, adversaries continue to advance their tactics and techniques. The emerging challenges originating from cyber-threats and the assessed trends are presented in this report. ENISA’s work in the area of threat analysis also includes: Threat assessments for two emerging technology areas i) hardware, and ii) ad-hoc and sensor networking for Mobile to Mobile communications (M2M), and An update on the cyber-threat taxonomy Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, commented on the project: “As we speak, the cyber-threat landscape is receiving significant high-level attention: it is on the agenda of politicians in the biggest industrial countries. This is a direct consequence of ‘cyber’ becoming mainstream, in affecting people’s opinions and influencing the political environment of modern societies. Besides this, a lot of developments have taken place regarding the tools and tactics used by adversaries, making 2016 another striking sample of the dynamics of cyber-space. ETL 2016 reflects these developments, while providing strategic information about the cyber-threats and their technical evolution during 2016.” The ETL report and related material can be found under the following links: ETL 2016 Thematic Landscape Hardware Thematic Landscape Ad-hoc and sensor networking for M2M communications ENISA Threat Taxonomy     For interviews and press enquiries please contact press@enisa.europa.eu    Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

Follow the activities on twitter #SID2017 #SaferInternetDay For online resources visit www.betterinternetforkids.eu and check the European Commission's activities on Better Internet for Kids and Information by the EC.                                                      ---------------------------- Furthermore, on the occasion of the day, ENISA issues its new studies on privacy and security in personal data clouds, cyber hygiene practices and a report on the deployment of the 2016 European Cyber Security Month. To find out more in specific areas of interest go through ENISA’s reports and training material. Privacy and Security in Personal Data Clouds Under its 2016 work programme, a new study on privacy and security in Personal Data Clouds, also known as Personal Data Vaults or Personal Data Stores, aims to identify the different architectures and components of PDCs and lay out their privacy and security challenges. Personal data clouds (PDCs) aim to provide end-users the typical data collection and storage capabilities of data management systems, and also to help end-users regain control over their data. PDCs are ideally embedded by privacy-enhancing elements allowing users to determine on their own how they want their data to be managed - in and outside of the solution - and with whom these should be shared. The study presents a “state of the art” analysis of the security and privacy features of PDCs based on an empirical analysis of various applications that fall under or are close to the definition of PDCs. The report assesses to what extent current PDC solutions - either available on the market or in a research and development phase - are supported by functionalities that enhance the level of security and privacy offered, by enabling  users to take decisions over their data and, ideally, apply them (user centric model). Given that mobile health applications have been gaining considerable attention nowadays, the study particularly identifies privacy-enhancing features adopted by certain PDCs in the health sector. For the full report                                              ------------------------------- Cyber hygiene practices Cyber hygiene is a fundamental principle relating to information security and, as the analogy with personal hygiene shows, is the equivalent of establishing simple routine measures to minimise the risks from cyber threats, specifically for SME’s. Good cyber hygiene practices can drive increased immunity across businesses. However, the variation between national practices leads to uncertainty and confusion over what needs to be implemented. A uniform approach to cyber hygiene which allows businesses to establish security trust across national borders would drive improvements across the board. Full report available online                                         ------------------------------- European Cyber Security Month 2016 – Deployment report The European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) is a key part of the EU's Cybersecurity Strategy to increase people's awareness of the key role they can play in ensuring the security of networks and information systems. The primary purpose of cyber security awareness campaigns is to influence the adoption of secure behaviour online. Last year’s ECSM took place across 32 countries focusing on security in banking, cyber safety, cyber training and mobile malware.

ENISA_NEWS_0448	2017-02-06	NEWS	Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments	 ENISA issues today its report on the Challenges of security certification in emerging ICT environments. The report is targeted at EU Member States (MS), the Commission, certification bodies and the private sector, and provides a thorough description of the cyber security certification status concerning the most critical equipment in various critical business sectors. The study contains information on the certification of devices in five business sectors namely, electricity, healthcare, information and communication technology, railway and water transport. It describes the situation in the EU, and discusses the advantages and challenges towards a more harmonised certification practice. The key finding of the report, is that every sector has its own functional and security challenges, which makes the target of a common certification framework a challenge in itself. Based on desk research and expert validation, an analysis is done to study the existing frameworks and standards, and to identify certification drivers, best practices and candidate products for certification of the five selected sectors. Finally an aggregated table is provided, which shortly reflects the certification drivers, the market situation and the recommendation for certification for each identified device.

ENISA_NEWS_0449	2017-02-03	NEWS	The power of sharing: ENISA report on cyber security information sharing in the energy sector	 The report first identifies existing CSIRTs (Computer Security Incident Response Teams), ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centres) and information sharing initiatives in the energy sector, analyses problems and shortcomings, and identifies good practices to facilitate the cyber security information sharing in this sector. Furthermore the report provides recommendations to address identified problems and shortcomings. Key findings include: • Trust is a key component of information sharing. • Participants in information sharing initiatives, are more committed and willing to contribute with information when their organisation backs them. Time, resources and knowledge, are some of the constraints faced by the participants that may hinder information sharing. • Only few energy sector specialists have in-depth understanding of both the complexities of the energy systems and cyber security. • Energy security issues are often addressed only at the Member State level, maintaining for example a national focus only, without taking into account the complexity of the interdependence of Member States in multiple aspects of the energy area, including cyber security. • The legal and policy context is complex and fragmented. • The quality of the shared information is not always at the required level, due to inconsistent use of the applicable taxonomy for example. • There is a need to create public-private partnerships when sharing information.   • Information is shared between heterogeneous players. • Many companies in the sector give more importance to the safety of their physical infrastructure than to the security of their computer, process systems and data. • Few good practices have been identified on the subject, and the current information sharing initiatives lack visibility within companies in the energy sector. The report is primarily addressed at national and governmental CSIRTs and other types of CSIRTs with activities and constituencies in the energy sector. Policy and lawmakers, notably the European Commission at the EU level, public and private organisations with an interest in NIS, and interested parties engaged in information sharing initiatives within the energy sector - including energy operators -  are also intended audiences.

ENISA_PR_0451	2017-02-01	PR	Attacks on ICS-SCADA: How to protect critical infrastructures	" The use of long-range communication networks, and specially the Internet, has revolutionised ICS-SCADA systems and architectures. The use of network communication in these systems has proven to be an effective way of gaining a means for remotely operating and maintaining these infrastructures in real-time. Therefore, these have become vital assets providing a functionality otherwise impossible. However, this also opens up the way for new threat vectors that can potentially compromise the efficient and secure operation of these systems. These threats are not necessarily new; many are inherited from the use of networking technologies - in use in IT areas for a long time now - which ultimately results in countermeasures being already available to mitigate or even eliminate them. ENISA’s study on communication network dependencies aims to help asset owners defend their critical infrastructures from emerging cyber threats. The main objective is to provide insight into the communication network interdependencies currently present in industrial infrastructures and environments, mapping critical assets, assessing possible attacks and identifying potential good practices and security measures to apply. After having mapped the most critical assets through interviews with experts in the field, the three most worrying potential attack scenarios, considering their potential impact and the assets that could be affected, were developed. Taking into consideration the experts’ views on available standards, good practices and security measures, and a series of recommendations have been developed including, among others, the following: Include security as a main consideration during the design phase of ICS-SCADA systems. Establish brainstorming and communication channels for the different participants in the lifecycle of the devices to exchange needs and solutions. Include the periodic ICS-SCADA device update process as part of the main operations of the systems. Promote increased collaboration amongst policy decision makers, manufacturers and operators at an EU Level. Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, said: ""ICS-SCADA are at the core of European critical infrastructures, and have to be protected against emerging cyber threats, as more and more, attacks are affecting these  systems"" ENISA’s future work in the field aims at enhancing the security and resilience of European critical infrastructures. In the context of the NIS Directive, ENISA will assist Member States and the European Commission by providing expertise and advice, as well as developing and facilitating the exchange of good practices, with the ultimate goal to enable higher level of security for Europe’s critical infrastructure. Furthermore, to understand the cybersecurity challenges involved in the domain of ICS-SCADA, ENISA coordinates EuroSCSIE and created the EICS Expert Group.

ENISA_NEWS_0452	2017-01-30	NEWS	ENISA study into taxonomies for incident detection and prevention 	 The study i) performs a qualitative assessment on an indicative taxonomy landscape, ii) identifies use cases that would benefit from the use of taxonomies iii) provides a comparison among a variety of related and unrelated taxonomies in order to identify commonalities and differences iv) analyses the complexity of taxonomies in terms of malware incidents in order to illustrate the different ways of describing the same context available in the current landscape. In particular, for each use case a requirement that a taxonomy should fulfil was identified. These use cases include: i) recording events from different sources, ii) automatic de-duplication, iii) ability to export in other taxonomies, iv) ability to aggregate and search events in the data, v) ability to exchange data with other CSIRTs, vi) feeding threat intelligence and vii) incident report management. Good practices and recommendations A set of good practices which take into account the shortcomings of taxonomies, as identified by CSIRTs during the study, highlight that: the top level categorisation of a taxonomy should be simple the categories within a taxonomy should be mutually exclusive taxonomies should support performance measurement taxonomies should have an appropriate level of ease of use Key recommendations include:   •A centralised repository for hosting all relevant taxonomies along with their versions should be set up by ENISA. This would be a great benefit to the CSIRTs community as it would not only allow the selection of appropriate taxonomies for specific use cases, but it may also provide a general overview of what taxonomies or variations thereof are used by CSIRTs, which may be particularly useful in keeping statistics.  •A small set of common taxonomies should be agreed upon by CSIRTs at the EU level for specific use cases. This would provide examples of taxonomies based on the requirements of the CSIRTs network, which can be either implemented or used to implement a modified version of the taxonomy, saving time and effort that would be spent into researching taxonomies.  • “Other” or “Unknown”, “Tag” field should be used by the owners of taxonomies as an indicator to revise taxonomies, or if there is an increase in that category with incidents or events of the same type. For example, in a case involving ransomware, it is relevant that it should be categorised as ransomware, but also the type of ransomware (such as crypto locker, etc.), if the same tag is repeatedly used then it might also indicate the need for a new field.  •A roadmap towards standardised exchange formats in the CSIRTs community should be established at the EU level by the CSIRTs network. Such a roadmap should at least consider having CSIRTs agree use cases, definitions and concepts from an operational point of view for each use case; perform quantitative assessment (in addition to the qualitative assessment in this study) on the taxonomies used, a centralised repository for taxonomies, and a list of tags/values that can apply across taxonomies. Key conclusions of the study, highly relevant for CSIRTs, indicate that:  Taxonomies currently lack terms to properly handle the following: the impact of an incident, incidents with no malice intended, explicit fields for ransomware, whether the incident is confirmed, and the differentiation between intrusion attempts and intrusions. The identified areas for potential improvement of existing taxonomies are based on the complexity, contextual information, mutual exclusivity or ambiguity, performance measurement, impact, sensitivity, confidentiality, and purpose of taxonomies There is currently no consensus on concepts and definitions related to taxonomies. Clear definitions reflecting the operational interpretation of the CSIRTs should be considered as a key success factor towards increasing cooperation between EU Member States.   Full report available online For interviews and press enquiries please contact press@enisa.europa.eu Tel. +302814409576   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0453	2017-01-27	NEWS	Security for Privacy on Data Protection Day	 The date marks the anniversary of the Council of Europe's Convention 108 on the protection of personal information, the first legally binding international law in the field of data protection. Guidelines for SMEs on the security of personal data processing ENISA shares some of its work in the field of data protection and privacy, with a focus on the  security of personal data processing. The latest report on 'Guidelines for SMEs on the security of personal data processing' attempts to assist in the implementation of the personal data protection regulatory framework by promoting the adoption of security measures to protect privacy. According to the General Data Protection Regulation, security equally covers confidentiality, integrity and availability, and should be considered following a risk-based approach: the higher the risk, the more rigorous the measures that the controller or the processor needs to take, in order to manage the risk. On this basis and as part of its continuous support on EU policy implementation, the report focuses on SME’s, acting either as data controllers or data processors, and facilitates their understanding on personal data processing operations, and subsequently, on the assessment of the associated security risks. The objectives of the study are to facilitate SMEs in understanding the context of the personal data processing operation and subsequently assess the associated security risks. Based on that, the study also proposes possible organizational and technical security measures for the protection of personal data, which are appropriate to the risk presented. These measures can be adopted by SMEs in order to achieve compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Full report available online  Further work on privacy and data protection by ENISA include: PETs controls matrix PETs controls matrix, a systematic approach and tool for assessing online and mobile privacy tools for end users.

ENISA_PR_0455	2017-01-18	PR	ENISA report on blockchain technology and security  	 Blockchain is a distributed ledger which maintains all transactions and assets and is updated by a number of counterparties. Financial institutions are investing in the technology - in what is hoped - to automate processes and remove “human” errors. This may help towards lowering transactional and operational costs by releasing the finance sector from its legacy systems. A World Economic Forum[1] report reveals that over one billion euros are invested in blockchain technology startups. Despite the potential cost savings, it remains important to assess what the security implications of Blockchain implementations might be. ENISA analysed the technology and identified security benefits, challenges and good practices. The report identifies that some principles used in the security of traditional systems and in blockchain, such as key management and encryption, are still largely the same.  There are however new challenges that the technology brings, like consensus hijacking and smart contract management. Additionally, it highlights that public and private ledger implementations will face different sets of challenges. To secure business information whilst leveraging blockchain technology, financial institutions should seek to adopt best practices which allow them to: monitor internal activity automate regulatory compliance disclose information only to relevant counterparts and authorities adopt industry level governance procedures which will facilitate the updating of ledger implementations over time Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, said: “Cyber security should be considered as a key element in the Blockchain implementation by financial institutions.”   ENISA held a workshop in October to validate the results of its study. The agency will remain active in providing awareness on the cyber security challenges in new technologies and continue its work in the finance sector as part of its mandate in the protection of critical information infrastructures. In the context of the NIS directive[2] and the Payment Services Directive ENISA works with ECB and EBA in addressing incident reporting and minimum security measures in the finance sector.   Full report hereFor interviews and press enquiries please contact press@enisa.europa.eu, Tel. +302814 409576 [2] https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive [1] World Economic Forum (WEF), “The Future of Financial Infrastructure”, Aug 2016, http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_future_of_financial_infrastructure.pdf      Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0457	2016-12-20	NEWS	PETs control matrix: A systematic approach for assessing online privacy tools	 The defined framework relies on a set of assessment criteria, which can be broken down into specific parameters and assessment points, acting as indicators of certain properties and features of the tools. A distinction is made between generic criteria (applicable to all tools) and specific criteria (addressing technical characteristics of different categories of tools). For the purpose of this work, the following categories of PETs have been considered: secure messaging, virtual private networks (VPNs), anonymizing networks, and anti-tracking tools (for online browsing). The ‘PETs control matrix’ is the implementation of the proposed methodology into a practical tool that can be used for performing the assessment of a PET and presenting the relevant results. As such, it comprises different sets of detailed assessment questions (and relevant closed sets of answers) corresponding to the predefined assessment criteria.  In this way, the ‘PETs control matrix’ can facilitate a standardized and clear presentation of different privacy tools, supporting in this way the possibility of comparative assessments.

ENISA_NEWS_0459	2016-12-19	NEWS	Cyber security key for the successful adoption of mobile payments	 ENISA assessed the most widely used payment applications and their security models to identify good practices. The identified results, validated in a workshop in November 2016, provide some key recommendations included in this report. These include: Customers should adopt minimum security measures when using mobile payment      applications Vendors should provide more visibility of the security measures in applications The mobile payment chain must maintain its security posture irrespectively of  the players involved Mobile payments provide convenience of use; as it allows customers the freedom to make payments at any given time without the use cards. Mobile payments are expected to grow by 80% percent[1] on a yearly basis in the next five years, but the security of mobile payments applications still remains a key concern. A key challenge identified is maintaining the security of mobile operating systems at a sufficient level. Mobile OS provide good security when applied, but many customers are not aware of these, and therefore do not use them. Another challenge is the security of the mobile payment chain, the assurance of which is paramount for the successful adoption of mobile payments. In the context of the NIS Directive[2], ENISA assists Member States and the European Commission by providing expertise and advice, as well as developing and facilitating the exchange of good practices, with the ultimate goal to enable higher level of security for Europe’s critical infrastructure, including finance. ENISA continues its work with the European Central Bank and the European Banking Authority providing its assistance and expertise on information security issues in the finance sector.  The Agency is also engages with industry through various working groups in the area of finance to exchange information and good practices in information security.   Full report available onlineFor interviews and press enquiries please contact press@enisa.europa.eu Tel. 2814 409576     [1] http://www.businessinsider.com/the-mobile-payments-report-market-forecasts-consumer-trends-and-the-barriers-and-benefits-that-will-influence-adoption-2016-5 [2] https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0460	2016-12-16	PR	Smart Airports: How to protect airport passengers from cyber disruptions	" In response to new emerging threats, ENISA’s report provides a guide for airport decision makers to implement available good practices to date, in order to secure passengers and operations. This study also identifies gaps such as disparity of cyber security practices and lack of awareness and skills. The study aims to support airport decision makers and information security professionals in their security efforts and risk management. Eight recommendations for enhancing the security and resilience of smart airports in Europe are presented in the report, tailored specifically towards decision makers, airport operators and industry. Key recommendations include: Prioritising cyber security for safety  Establishing a clear airport cyber security posture and allocating cybersecurity experts and resources Constant revision of cyber security policies and practices based on good practices monitoring      Implementing  network-based, holistic risk and threat management policies and processes for cyber security Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, said: ""Integrating IoT on the existing airport infrastructure brings new security challenges. To ensure safety, operators need to incorporate cybersecurity in all stages of the security life cycle."" Smart airports are those airports making use of integrated Internet of Things (IoT) components to bring added-value services. By integrating smart components, airports are exposed to a larger attack surface and new attack vectors. As such, airports need to guarantee everyday higher levels of cyber security due to the potential impact that cyber-attacks and disruptions can have on the safety of passengers and operators. Increasing awareness on cyber security risks and improving the security and resilience of the entire lifecycle of airport operations is now a priority. ENISA’s future work in the field, aims in enhancing the security and resilience of air transport in Europe together with all relevant key stakeholders and agencies. In the context of the NIS Directive, ENISA will assist Member States and the European Commission by providing expertise and advice, as well as developing and facilitating the exchange of good practices, with the ultimate goal to enable higher level of security for Europe’s air transport infrastructure.

ENISA_NEWS_0461	2016-12-12	NEWS	The importance of cryptography for the digital society	 Within the context of proposals to weakening encryption to facilitate the work of law enforcement, ENISA outlines in seven key messages, the challenges which result from such an act, lowering trust in online services and the smooth implementation of the Digital Dingle Market and EU industry. In the paper it is identified that weakening encryption can affect other aspects of cryptology, and a cost benefit analysis should be deployed prior to any legislation put forward.   ENISA sees that: The use of backdoors in cryptography is not a solution, as existing legitimate users are put at risk by the very existence of backdoors. Backdoors do not address the challenge of accessing of decrypting material, because criminals can already develop and use their own cryptographic tools. Furthermore, new technologies are now being deployed making lawful interception in a timely manner very difficult. Judicial oversight may not be a perfect solution; as different interpretations of the legislation may occur. Law enforcement solutions need to be identified without the use of backdoors and key escrow. It is very difficult to restrict technical innovation using legislation. History has shown that technology beats legislation, and criminals are best placed to capitalise on this opportunity. The perception that backdoors and key escrow exist, can potentially affect and undermine the aspirations for a fully embraced Digital Society in Europe. History has shown that legal controls are not always successful, and may harm and inhibit innovation, as seen with previous US experience.   ENISA collaborates closely with Europol, with the development of an expert working group on the topic, discussing on technical options to meet the needs of law enforcement while advocating the need to maintain strong encryption.

ENISA_PR_0465	2016-11-24	PR	Diagnosing cyber threats for smart hospitals	 ENISA presents a study that sets the scene on information security for the adoption of IoT in Hospitals. The study which engaged information security officers from more than ten hospitals across the EU, depicts the smart hospital ICT ecosystem; and through a risk based approach focuses on relevant threats and vulnerabilities, analyses attack scenarios, and maps common good practices.  A rough estimation on the cost of cyber security incidents in hospitals[1] shows that a change in mentality is required. The need for improved, and even remote, patient care drives hospitals to transform by adapting smart solutions, ignoring sometimes the emerging security and safety issues. Nothing comes without a price: hospitals are the next target for cyber-attacks. The increasing number of ransomware cases and DDoS attacks is just a glimpse of things to come. The introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) components in the hospital ecosystem, increases the attack vector rendering hospitals even more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The report recommends, inter alia, that: Healthcare organisations should provide specific IT security requirements for IoT components and implement only state of the art security measures Smart hospitals should identify the assets and how these will be interconnected (or connected to the Internet) and based on this identification adopt specific practices Device manufacturers should incorporate security into existing quality assurance systems and involve healthcareorganisation from the very beginning when designing systems and services.  ENISA Executive Director, Udo Helmbrecht, commented: “Interconnected, decision making devices offer automation and efficiency in hospitals, making them at the same time vulnerable to malicious actions. ENISA seeks to co-operate with all stakeholders to enhance security and safety in hospitals adopting smart solutions, namely smart hospitals”.   Healthcare is moving up on the policy agenda: the adoption of the NIS Directive includes in scope healthcare organisations. ENISA in 2017 will work on supporting the Member States introducing baseline security measures to the critical sectors, focusing on healthcare organisations. Moreover, in continuation to this work, ENISA will look more closely at cyber security issues in medical devices. The report findings were presented in the 2nd ENISA eHealth security workshop, which was organised on the 23rd of November, together with the Vienna Hospitals Association. In a session dedicated to “IoT Security for eHealth”, experts from the private and public healthcare sector, organisations and policy makers, exchanged views and experiences through live demos.

ENISA_NEWS_0466	2016-11-23	NEWS	ENISA at Bitkom hub-conference: Feeling secure about your smart device?	 This year the Agency shared insights on IoT cybersecurity and smart environments, and showcased a live-demo on securing smart home devices. The live-demo session, which was presented for the first time, focused on how to securely select, manage and operate smart devices while demonstrating the applicability and cost-effectiveness of good practices. Smart locks served as a representative example of an IoT device. ENISA’s experts illustrated the potential risks presented in products, and proposed a series of recommendations and practical measures to hinder exploit and promote secure use. Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA said: “In order to capitalise on the benefits of IoT we need to focus on security and resilience. ENISA works together with industry and the private sector to identify relevant risks and challenges and develop best practices”. According to ENISA’s studies the main reasons behind the increased cyber security risks associated with IoT, include the lack of a security mindset and standardization, short rollout times for IoT product development, limited device resources, and minimal update mechanisms. These shortcomings can have a strong impact[1] on security. ENISA is active in the IoT domain and has released relevant reports in this area. The Agency believes that the early adoption of its proposed good practices can help boost citizens’ trust and confidence in IoT solutions and pave the way for their wider deployment.

ENISA_NEWS_0467	2016-11-17	NEWS	Growing need for a common security framework, says ENISA Head of Administration at international cybersecurity conference	"   ENISA’s Head of Administration, Paulo Empandinhas, was present together with international partners and institutions, and government representatives. Paulo Empadinhas participated in the panel on ""Constitution, State and Cyberspace: Contradiction in terms”? where he spoke on the ‘general data protection regulation and IoT, and the impact in the EU chart of fundamental rights’ explaining the harmonisation, simplification and update in the technological advances that the reform brings. “Trusting IoT requires a coordinated effort from all actors, as IoT brings smartness and new security challenges” said Paulo Empadinhas. Defining security management at the organisational level, developing information exchange on threats and risks and promoting a common cyber security framework are key to secure IoT. Security concerns include the fact that manufacturers don’t invest in security and the difficulty to secure the entire lifecycle of products, while the notion of security and privacy are closely linked. With this in mind, ENISA proposes the establishment of security procurement guidelines, a framework to evaluate the security of products, and the support of security-driven business models. “There is a need for specific IoT security framework, as safety is a new parameter which needs to be integrated which goes beyond technical requirements. Cross-sector baseline capabilities, public-private collaboration and sectoral guidance, as developed by ENISA, help in this direction” said Paulo Empandinhas. The event hosted key figures including the Secretary of State for the Presidency of the Council of Ministers Miguel S. Roque and the President of the National Commission for Data Protection Filipa Calvão.

ENISA_NEWS_0468	2016-11-14	NEWS	Updated Good Practice Guide on National Cyber Security Strategies by ENISA 	 ENISA publishes its second National Cyber Security Strategy Good Practice Guide, providing an update to the 2012 ENISA guidebook on the design and implementation of a National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS). This guide includes an update on the different steps, objectives and good practices of the first edition, and analyses the status of National Cyber Security Strategies in the European Union and EFTA countries. The key aim is to support EU Member States in their efforts to develop and update their NCSS. Furthermore, the guide proposes a NCCS lifecycle, with a special emphasis on the ‘evaluation and maintaining’ phase. It presents six steps for the design and development of a NCSS and sixteen objectives for the implementation of the NCSS. The guide can be used as a tool by governmental bodies that are responsible for cyber security strategies. It highlights good practices, identifies gaps and challenges, and suggests key performance indicators (KPIs) for the evaluation phase. It concludes with a set of recommendations on how to proceed with the development and maintenance of a NCSS. The guide is targeted at public officials, policy makers and entities involved in the lifecycle of the strategy such as private, civil and industry stakeholders. The recently adopted NIS Directive requires all EU Member States to develop and adopt a NCSS. For this reason, the guide will particularly assist countries that don't have a strategy already in place, through the design and implementation phase, while assist countries which have a strategy, to update and strengthen their NCSS. The National Cyber Security Strategy Good Practice Guide  is available online.

ENISA_NEWS_0472	2016-11-07	NEWS	Cyber Insurance: A look at recent advances, good practices and challenges by ENISA	 The aim of the report is to raise awareness for the most impactful market advances, by shortly identifying the most significant cyber insurance developments for the past four years – during 2012 to 2016 – and to capture the good practices and challenges during the early stages of the cyber insurance lifecycle, i.e. before an actual policy is signed, laying the ground for future work in the area. Member States understanding the importance of addressing cyber-risk, have taken relevant action by publishing guides of good cyber-hygiene[1] [2]. Insurance federations have also shown a great interest in cyber-insurance, with actions taking place both at the European and national level. A rising concern among a number of insurers is found to be the uncertainty around accumulating risk[3]. A subset of key recommendations, for the betterment of the cyber insurance constituency, to policy makers, insurance companies, and future customers include: To policy makers: avoid the introduction of mandatory requirements that might undermine the cyber-insurance market adoption rate To insurance companies: a) consider adopting common standards and methodologies, b) introduce explanatory sessions, and provide customer scenarios and generic examples of policy coverage and c) clarify the policy language and offer a transparent underwriting process To cyber insurance customers: get informed, prepare and document the environment before requesting a cyber-insurance policy. The report is targeted primarily at insurance companies, to either benchmark themselves against the market trends, or evaluate good practices before entering the market. Additional beneficiaries are customers interested to adopt a cyber insurance policy. Founded to address residual risk, the cyber insurance market is anticipating a growth in both technological and sales volume terms; a growth that is expected to be further accelerated by the legislative additions of the GDPR and NIS Directive.   Full report is available here For interviews and press enquiries please contact press@enisa.europa.eu   [1] France, ANSSI “40 essential measures for a healthy network” http://bit.ly/2dr6nbA [2] United Kingdom, Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy “Cyber essentials scheme: overview” http://bit.ly/1hkkmdz [3] For example, in the event that an incident would occur an insurer cannot be certain about the number of customers that would be affected.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0473	2016-11-03	NEWS	Cyber Security Assesment Netherlands 2016 published	" The Cyber Security Assessment Netherlands (CSAN) is published annually by the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre and drawn up in close collaboration between public and private parties. The aim is to offer insight into developments, interests, threats and resilience in the field of cyber security over the period from May 2015 to April 2016. Every edition is translated in English, in order to facilitate knowledge transfer to our partners In the context of the growing threats in the digital domain, there are four notable developments in the CSAN 2016: Professional criminals carry out long-lasting and high-quality operations Digital economic espionage by foreign intelligence services puts a strain on the competitiveness of the Netherlands Ransomware is commonplace and has become even more advanced Advertising networks have not yet shown the ability to cope with malvertising Last year there was an increase in actual cyber threats. According to State Secretary Dijkhoff, the findings from the CSAN 2016 are worrisome: ""These developments have implications for the whole of the Netherlands and lead to direct action. Through the National Detection Network, the government and the business community keep each other informed about current threats. In the coming period, I am going to put extra effort into this digital dike monitoring. We have to be realistic: no one person can oversee everything all the time. Therefore, the government and society must work together to keep our online world safe. The basis is knowing where vulnerabilities are, sharing that information and then 'closing down the gaps.'

ENISA_NEWS_0478	2016-10-21	NEWS	Industry collaboration event: Matching supply and demand in EU cybersecurity	 The workshop, which took place in Brussels, looks at matching supply and demand in EU cybersecurity. The focus is two-fold: to identify cybersecurity challenges and requirements in two key sectors, electronic payments and eHealth, and to explore to what extent suppliers of cybersecurity products and services are able to respond in a commercially neutral environment. In particular, objectives of the workshop include to: understand the challenges and cyber security requirements of the eHealth and ePayments industries showcase state-of-the-art approaches in the two topics match EU cybersecurity challenges and requirements with opportunities and capabilities explore what industry can offer (without discussing individual products) draft a list of concrete actions - after a ‘matching exercise’ - and communicate these to the relevant authorities The industry group was created by ENISA in an effort to compliment with discussions on implementation strategies and methods related to the current active policy debate on NIS themes. The particular event, brings together representatives from the European Commission, public and private entities, health, banking and IT sectors.  The aim is to generate a better understanding of challenges and requirements in these industries for potential suppliers, and to inform the consumer industries on potential solutions to respective issues. The overall goal is to ensure that policy makers are aware of the degree of effort and cost necessary to implement policy ideas, and conversely that the EU industry, whether acting as consumers or suppliers of cybersecurity products and services, are able to get optimal benefit from these policies. ENISA takes a closer look in these two fields as the health sector, and in particular innovations related to e/m- Health, is increasingly considered as a critical infrastructure while the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) is expected to  impact the security of payment services.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0479	2016-10-20	PR	Cyber Europe 2016: the pan-European exercise to protect EU Infrastructures against coordinated cyber-attack	" The European ICT Industry is one of the most advanced in the world. Making the EU's single market fit for the digital age could contribute €415 billion per year to our economy and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs[1]. The pervasiveness of high-speed connectivity and the richness and quality of online services in the European Union are among the best globally. Such advantages have considerably increased the dependability of European citizens on ICT services. These two elements, quality of services and customer base, make this industry particularly appealing to global business. What if this important piece of the global economy becomes a target? Computer security attacks are increasingly used to perform industrial reconnaissance, lead disinformation campaigns, manipulate stock markets, leak sensitive information, tamper with customer data, sabotage critical infrastructures. In Cyber Europe 2016, Member State cybersecurity authorities and cybersecurity experts from the public and private sectors, are called to react to a series of unprecedented, coordinated cyber-attacks. This is a summary of the Cyber Europe 2016 scenario. Today marks the climax of this realistic scenario which thousands of experts from all 28 EU Member States, Switzerland and Norway are facing in Cyber Europe 2016 – a flagship activity organised every two years by ENISA, the EU Agency for Network and Information Security. Cyber Europe 2016 (CE2016) is the largest and most comprehensive EU cyber-security exercise to date. This large-scale distributed technical and operational exercise started in April 2016, offering the opportunity for cybersecurity professionals across Europe to analyse complex, innovative and realistic cybersecurity incidents. On 13th and 14th of  October ICT and IT security industry experts  from more than 300 organisations, including but not limited to: national and governmental cybersecurity agencies, ministries, EU institutions as well as internet and cloud service providers and cybersecurity software and service providers will be called upon to mitigate the apex of this six-month long cyber crisis, to ensure business continuity and, ultimately, to safeguard the European Digital Single Market[2].Cyber Europe 2016 paints a very dark scenario, inspired by events such as the blackout in an European Country over Christmas period and the dependence on technologies manufactured outside the jurisdiction of the European Union. It also features the Internet of Things, drones, cloud computing, innovative exfiltration vectors, mobile malware, ransomware, etc. The exercise will focus on political and economic policies closely related to cybersecurity. This also takes into account new processes and cooperation mechanisms contained in the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive. For the first time, a full scenario was developed with actors, media coverage, simulated companies and social media, bringing in the public affairs dimension associated with cyber crises, so as to increase realism to a level never seen before in cybersecurity exercises.  The Cyber Europe motto is ‘stronger together’. Cooperation at all levels is key to the successful mitigation of major, borderless cyber incidents. ENISA plays a key role in EU cyber preparedness The NIS Directive[3] is a major step forward the EU's abilities to deal with large cross border incidents that can lead to such crises. The CSIRT Network established by the Directive, along with work done so far  for  the EU Cyber Europe cycle, are key in providing decision makers with an overview of the situation and ultimately to respond to such complex threats. Günther H. Oettinger, European Commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society said: “In our connected societies, cyber-security concerns us all: we are only as strong as our weakest link. This is why our Directive on Network and Information Security promotes cooperation between EU Member States. With the help of our security agency ENISA, we are running “Cyber Europe” exercises. “Cyber Europe 2016” provides a unique opportunity for Member States, public and private partners to enhance cyber contingency plans and pan-European cooperation."" Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, said: “The role of ENISA in assisting the EU Member States for cyber crises is essential, both by organising exercises and by bringing together key stakeholders. Six years have passed since our first cyber crisis simulation and in that time the maturity level and response capability on complex cyber issues has increased. We are better prepared than we were, but that does not mean we have done enough and the work must continue. Cyber-attacks are more sophisticated than before. Cybersecurity is not a state, it is a process.” ENISA, the European Commission and the Member States are investing in strengthening of an EU-wide cybersecurity crisis cooperation. The future of cyber crisis management in Europe - currently planned by the European Commission, concerns the drafting of a cyber crisis cooperation plan and the development of a cyber crisis management platform. ENISA’s exercises provide a unique opportunity to test new developments, prepare for the future and develop further the sense of cooperation in the EU. Next steps The outcomes of Cyber Europe 2016 will be analysed by ENISA and the Member States. Detailed lessons learned will be shared with the participants to the exercise in order to establish a list of actions to improve cybersecurity in Europe. It is expected that many of the findings of the exercise are useful for the implementation of the NIS Directive and the work of the CSIRT Network, and the European cyber cooperation platform. An after action report will be published with the main findings which will be made publically available early in 2017.  Cyber Europe will follow up in 2018, while a number smaller scale exercises are planned in between.   Notes to Editors Cyber Europe 2016 Exercise Q&A Audio-visual material for Cyber Europe 2016: Logo (ENISA Cyber Europe and Cyber Europe 2016) Cyber Europe 2016 video trailer and promo video Cyber Europe 2016 poster 1 (A4, web) Cyber Europe 2016 Exercise images Cyber Europe website Cyber Exercise Series After Action report Cyber Europe 2014 Cyber crisis cooperation   For more information: Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Exercises Team, email: c3@enisa.europa.eu For press and media interviews: please email press@enisa.europa.eu  Tel. +30 2814 409 576   [1] https://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market_en [2] https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa2019s-role-in-the-european-digital-single-market-dsm [3] https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/network-and-information-security-nis-directive  *Originally published on 13th October.

ENISA_PR_0481	2016-10-18	PR	ENISA in co-operation with the EU Slovakian Presidency, hosts key workshop on the NIS Directive 	 The workshop, co-organised with the Slovakian National Security Agency on the 17th  and 18th of October in Bratislava, gathers participants from the EU Commission, relevant public authorities within Member States and representatives of the private sector to debate on the implementation of the NIS Directive. The NIS Directive is the first EU legislation specifically aimed at improving cybersecurity throughout the Union. The workshop focuses on specific topics of the NIS Directive which require immediate attention from the relevant stakeholders involved. The two-day debate addresses: National Cyber Security Strategies as a core component of the new provisions; emphasis is placed  on good practices identified within Member States Protecting Critical Information Infrastructure Security measures for Digital Service Providers with emphasis on the appropriate concept to take into consideration  to address overall NIS Directive in a consistent manner Incident Reporting for Digital Service Providers with emphasis on the parameters and thresholds to be deployed in the implementing provisions. By developing a common approach across these topics, the NIS Directive will help ensure a consistent approach to cybersecurity “with a view to achieving a high common level of security of networks and information systems within the Union so as to improve the functioning of the internal market”[1]. Director of Information Security and Electronic Signature Department of the Slovak National Security Authority, Mr. Rastislav Janota said: “The NIS Directive is the first EU-wide rules on cybersecurity and the main instrument supporting Europe´s cyber resilience. Therefore, we are delighted to organize, in cooperation with ENISA, one of the first workshops that brings the relevant experts from various countries together and gives them a platform to discuss the highest relevant topics associated with transposition of the NIS Directive. This event which is organized during the European Cyber Security Month is on the one hand the perfect opportunity to present various national challenges and approaches that have been developed after the NIS Directive adoption, and on other hand could help involved stakeholders and decision makers gather relevant information.” ENISA’s Executive Director Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht said: “The NIS Directive is one of the components for the delivery of digital single market. Its success lies with the full engagement of all the stakeholders identified in the Directive, including digital service providers. Cyber security challenges can be only addressed by working together.” ENISA is ideally positioned to assist Member States and private sector in implementing the NIS Directive. The Agency has already done work in the area of finance, energy, e-health and transport but also on baseline security requirements, incident reporting, and national cyber security strategies. ENISA is member of the Cooperation Group and runs the secretariat of the CSIRT Network, the component elements of the Cooperation Network that is at the core of the Directive.

ENISA_PR_0486	2016-10-06	PR	Malicious actions not necessarily focused on causing disruptions in TELECOM, but system failures still are	 The report provides an overview of the root causes of the incidents and an aggregated level of which services and network assets are impacted. Incidents are reported on an annual basis by the Telecom Regulators under Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC) to ENISA and the European Commission. In 2015, 138 major incidents were reported, from twenty-one (21) EU countries and two (2) EFTA members while nine (9) countries reported no significant incidents. Most incidents reported, involve mobile telephony, which was the most affected service in 2015. The most frequent causes for incidents are system failures. ENISA’s Executive Director, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, said: “All parts of society rely on public electronic communications networks and services. Being transparent and discussing the causes of incidents, is essential for risk management and improving the level of security. ENISA is dedicated to help increase resilience in the electronic communications sector and will continue to foster and support transparency on incident reporting, promoting a systematic approach towards improved security measures in the sector.” In summary, key findings indicate: Mobile internet  most affected service: In 2015 most incidents affected mobile internet,  44% of all reported incidents. Mobile internet and mobile telephony were the predominant affected services in the previous years too, except for 2014 where fixed telephony was the most affected. System failures are  the dominant root cause of incidents: 70 % of the incidents are caused  by system failures or technical failures which also accounts as the dominant root cause for all the reporting years so far. In the system failures category, software bugs and hardware failures are the most commoncauses affecting switches and routers, and mobile base stations. Human errors affected on average more user connections per incident: In 2015 human errors were  the root cause category involving most users affected, accounting for      almost 2.6 million user connections on average per incident. The second  place was taken by system failures with 2.4 million user connections on average  per incident. Malicious actions are not focused on causing disruptions: the total number of incidents  caused by malicious actions dropped to 2.5% from 9.6% in 2014. This may indicate that the malicious actions are not necessarily aiming at causing  unavailability of services, but might have other objectives. Nevertheless,  these types of incidents (ex: DDoS) had the most impact in terms of  duration, accounting on average almost two days per incident. New services affected: TV broadcasting / Cable TV Networks  by 14% and SMS/MMS by 13%, public email by 5%, IPTV by 4,4%, VOIP services by 3,7%  were the most affected services among the new ones that started being  collected from this year. These patterns are particularly important for risk and vulnerability assessments. In particular, conclusions on the main patterns of incidents contribute at a policy level on the strategic measures to improve the security in the electronic communications sector. Art. 13a is part of the current Telecom Framework, a regulatory framework which is currently under review by the EU Commission, while a new draft is being expected by the end of the year. As a consultative body for the EU Commission, ENISA sustains a more harmonised approach between the newly adopted NIS Directive and the upcoming regulation. ENISA has an extensive expertise in the telecom sector, as activities in this area have been carried out for many years, which in  in the telecom area cover: incident reporting, security measures, threats and assets, power supply dependencies, national roaming for resilience, ICT procurement in the telecom sector, and mitigating cable cuts.

ENISA_NEWS_0490	2016-09-20	NEWS	Udo Helmbrecht at Munich Security Conference on connectivity and security in critical infrastructures	" Udo Helmbrecht participates at the fourth Cyber Security Summit hosted by the Munich Security Conference in Silicon Valley, where on the 19th and 20th September he joins around a hundred key representatives from both the EU and the US scene, from diverse fields of the public and private sphere to debate on trending cyber challenges. Among the speakers at the MSC panel on ""Connectivity vs. Security? Critical Infrastructure under Cyber Attack"", ENISA’s Executive Director, Udo Helmbrecht said that while modern economies rely on the newly developed cyber infrastructures assuring their security has become the main priority of many actors such as governments and companies, as this may have implications on the economies and business. “Dependencies of critical infrastructure across the EU increase the attack surface and the potential impact of cyber incidents”. Furthermore, critical infrastructures - such as electricity generation plants, transportation systems, manufacturing facilities – are controlled and monitored by Industrial Control Systems (ICS), including SCADA systems. The importance of continuous improvement of ICS-SCADA[1] security for critical service providers is increasingly recognized as a high priority area among European critical infrastructure operators due to its strategic impact on processes essential for uninterrupted functioning of the EU industries and economy. It is noted that the most expensive attacks are considered to be insider threats, while DoS/DDoS and malicious insiders attack, are the two types which collectively constitute approximately half the annualized cost of all cybercrime. In terms of country loss, the costs can reach up to 1.6% of GDP in some EU countries[2] while for the global economy, loss is estimated between 330 to 506 billion euros.[3] Finance, ICT and energy sectors display the highest incident costs. In this context it was explained how mandatory incident reporting from the telecom sector (Art. 13a of the Telecom Package) and trust service providers (Art. 19 of the eIDAS Regulation) provides an aggregated overview of incidents of significant impact. “National cyber security strategies and the recent NIS Directive help enhance cyber security from a policy perspective, setting the foundations for increased EU-level cooperation, risk management and incident reporting obligations, for operators of essential services and digital service providers. Government and the private sector can cooperate more proactively in order to not just respond, but also better deter and defend against potential cyberattacks”.

ENISA_NEWS_0491	2016-09-12	NEWS	Discussion on implementing the NIS Directive and enhancing competitiveness	 Udo Helmbrecht met together with representatives from the political and business sphere including Saskia Esken (MP,SPD), Bodo Meseke, (Ernst & Young), Prof. Dr. Michael Waidner, (Director, Fraunhofer SIT) and Olaf Siemens (DCSO) to discuss on  ‘New European rules on IT security - new demands on the business’ at the Berliner Digital Dialog. Udo Helmbrecht shared insights into the costs caused by cyber-attacks. Determining the real economic impact of incidents on EU’s economy can help in defining proper, coherent and cost effective mitigation policies.  Costs can reach up to 1.6% of GDP in some EU countries[1] while for the global economy, loss is estimated between 330 to 506 billion euros[2]. Finance, ICT and energy sectors display the highest incident costs. The requirements deriving from the NIS Directive for industry and what is expected from Digital Services Providers (DSPs) and Essential Service Operators (ESOs) – from the energy, banking, healthcare, transport sector - on incident reporting were discussed. Furthermore, the contribution of standardisation strategies was looked into as a component to increase EU competitiveness, trust, provide a functional operational framework for emerging technologies, and ultimately security. “Many of the most costly attacks are considered to be insider threats. It is important to protect our industry and preserve the smooth functioning of the internal market and our economy.  The provisions of the NIS Directive can act as a tool for businesses, for improved risk management and more resilient operation systems” commented Udo Helmbrecht.   [1] Cost of Cyber Crime Study: France, Ponemon Institute, 2014 [2] Net Losses: Estimating the Global Cost of Cybercrime, McAfee, 2014     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0492	2016-09-09	NEWS	ENISA in 2015 - Annual Report	 This past year was particularly active - given the agreements on the NIS Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the announcement of the Digital Single Market (DSM) initiative by the Commission, with the Agency working together with the EU institutions, contributing to the processes at the EU level and translating to stakeholders - and particularly industry - the new regulatory environment. These landmark agreements make the Agency’s work even more important within the EU on cybersecurity, and its stimulus to the internal market growth. Highlights of the year, include best practices and recommendations in sectors such as e-health, finance, smart infrastructure and services, and cloud computing. The Agency continued work on renown activities such as Article 13a (disruption in the telecom sector) and Article 4 reporting (personal data breaches) and developing synergies between the two, and supported the implementation of the Article 19 (eIDAS), and CSIRTs training. Similarly, ENISA built on enhancing its presence further through key industry events and the increasing awareness through the annual Cyber Security Month (ECSM) and preparing for the pan-European cyber exercise in 2016. Article 14 requests - a mechanism which allows Member States and EU institutions to request specific items of work from the Agency beyond the work programme execution process - have grown in significance and demand, demonstrating an increase of 92%. In 2015 the Agency successfully produced a total of fifty-three (53) deliverables on a variety of subjects. These range from national issues, such as the protection of critical infrastructures, to issues affecting citizens at an individual level such as privacy and data protection, and the annual report on cyber threats. Throughout 2015 ENISA strengthened relations with the institutions, the public sector, industry and the research community, and assisted in making significant improvements to the state of cybersecurity throughout the EU – in areas such as standardisation, PETs, privacy by design (PbD) -responding to a rapidly developing threat environment and helping Member States to lay solid foundations for the information systems of the future, while promoting best practices and developing synergies towards a smooth cyber EU environment. All activities carried out during the year resulted in various best practices and recommendations, available online ENISA’s website.

ENISA_PR_0493	2016-09-09	PR	Privacy tools, security measures and evaluation of current technologies under the spotlight at this year’s Annual Privacy Forum	" The two-day event took place at the historic venue of former IG Farben headquarters. In the context of the conference a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between ENISA and F-Secure, setting a framework for both parties to share expertise and knowledge. Goethe University Vice President Manfred Schubert-Zsilavecz and Chair of Mobile Business & Multilateral Security Kai Rannenberg discussed the relation to the infamous history of IG Farben and highlighted the importance of the right to privacy for a free and democratic society as part of the Human Rights Charter, a topic which has triggered debates in light of the data protection regulation and the European Digital Agenda. ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht furthered the discussion in his opening speech: “Is privacy gone? Can technology help or is it harmful to privacy? In a changing world, do we need to resist or to adapt?” Deputy EDPS, Wojciech Wiewiórowski, welcomed the collaboration for more effective privacy protection and the colocation with the Internet Privacy Engineering Network Workshop in the same week. Trust, collaboration and common sense for effective privacy Thomas Kremer (Deutsche Telekom) in his keynote speech on 'Data Protection in the digital world' underlined the importance of trust and acceptance of ICT by the users, whereas Jacoba Sieders (ABN AMRO) in her closing keynote on 'Observations on privacy and data protection from a security perspective' presented the challenges in terms of privacy and data protection faced by large multi-national organisations that serve millions of customers. The workshop of the EDPS on Internet Privacy Engineering Network, that followed the Annual Privacy Forum, highlighted the need for further joint work between engineers and lawyers. Mikko Hypponen, security and privacy expert (F-Secure), spoke on the 'State of the Net'. With his key message “don’t press the button” audiences were reminded that many viruses are let in by the user. Hypponen elaborated on how to handle such issues, but in the end: “don’t press the button!"" This year’s panels looked into: online privacy tools for general public, dealing with the availability of reliable online privacy tools today appropriate security measures for the processing of personal data to further explore a risk based approach building a community for maturity evaluation of PETs to discuss a structured community approach, on the evaluation of the technology readiness, and maturity of current privacy enhancing technologies.

ENISA_PR_0497	2016-08-10	PR	Determining the real economic impact of cyber-incidents: A mission (almost) impossible	 Cyber security incidents affecting CIIs (Critical Information Infrastructures) are considered nowadays “global risks that can have significant negative impact for several countries or industries within the next 10 years”[1]. But the job of identifying the real impact produced proves to be quite a challenge. Today ENISA publishes a systematic review of studies on the economic impact of cyber-security incidents on critical information infrastructures (CII) which provide resources of core functions which society depends upon. An unavailability of these resources would have a debilitating effect on society as a whole. A prevalent challenge for all stakeholders involved (decision makers, companies and others) is to identify the exact magnitude of incidents in terms of national or EU-wide economic impact. In this context, the aim of the study is to provide an estimate, on the basis of available public source information. The study demonstrates that the absence of a common approach and criteria for performing such an analysis has led to the development of rarely comparable standalone approaches that are often only relevant to a specific context and to a limited audience.  While some studies show annual economic impact per country, other studies provide cost per incident or per organisation. Furthermore, some studies use real cost while others use approximations based on different techniques or on internal frameworks. Despite the lack of comparable studies, this systematic review has allowed to come up with compelling findings for future work in the field, and build an early view on the current situation in the EU and beyond. The major common findings include: Finance, ICT and Energy sectors have the highest incident costs The most common cyber attack types for financial sector and ICTs appear to be DoS/DDoS and malicious insiders, with the latter affecting also  public administration/government sectors The most costly attacks are considered to be insider threats, followed by DDoS and web based attacks In terms of country losses, the figures demonstrate up to 1.6% GDP in some EU countries. Other studies mention figures like 425,000 to 20 million euro per company per year “Determining realistic cost values is key to outline the economic impact of cyber incidents on the EU’s economy. ENISA can play a significant role in the future, on developing work that take into account all critical variables that define the EU cyber-space, given that all the necessary resources have been allocated” commented ENISA’s Executive Director  Prof. Udo Helmbrecht A general recommendation towards all types of readers that may be interested in such studies, is that findings  would have to be  contextualised prior to adopting conclusions or drawing their own . By doing so it will help to better understand the gaps or parts uncovered by the study, and understand the overall findings of the study and their relevance within the actual context.

ENISA_NEWS_0504	2016-07-01	NEWS	ENISA activities in support of Trust Services	 The Regulation strengthens the provisions for interoperability and mutual recognition of electronic identification schemes across borders, enhances current rules for electronic signatures and also expands the scope of Directive 1999/93/EC to other trust services used in electronic transactions. Trust services are a key element in increasing the confidence of EU citizens and businesses in electronic transactions. As such, the eIDAS Regulation establishes a stable legal framework for five types of trust services, namely electronic signatures, electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and Website authentication certificates. “Electronic identity is the backbone of security on the internet. This work therefore represents an important step forward for Europe” said ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht. ENISA supports the implementation of the Regulation in two flows with: 1) Activities linked to supporting and providing guidelines for trust service providers. These include studies on: Minimum security measures and good security practices for trust services providers Common audit schemes for trust services providers in Member States Analysis of standards related to TSPs and mapping them to the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation (new!) Recommendations for the introduction on the market of qualified website authentication certificates 2) Activities linked to incident notifications, by providing mechanisms for reporting security breaches by the trust service providers to the competent bodies. Furthermore the Agency in collaboration with the European Commission, organises annually the Trust Services Forum, a platform that brings together the communities of trust service providers from the EU Trusted List, conformity assessment bodies and supervisory authorities, providing the opportunity to discuss on issues related to the regulation. Future work of ENISA in the field In 2016 ENISA will publish a set of technical recommendations, aimed at facilitating the implementation of the provisions related to trust services in the areas not covered by adopted secondary legislation, which are foreseen to be applied on a voluntary basis by the Member States. These include: Procedures for the interaction with trust service providers and conformity assessment bodies. (Article 17) Procedures for granting qualified status to a Trust Service Provider. (Article 21) Formats and procedures for the initiation of a qualified trust service. (Article 21) Minimum content and formats for the conformity assessment report obligatory for the initiation of a qualified trust service. (Article 21) Recommended standards to fulfil the requirements of the Trust Service Chapter of the eIDAS Regulation. (Articles 19.4, 24.5, 32.3, 33.2, 34.2, 44.2, 45.2, 28, 38, 42.) Risk management and security measures for TSPs. (Article 19.a.)  The Agency also plans on developing a series of documents and informative material to support relying parties and end users of qualified trust services included in the eIDAS Regulation to securely use these services. * (EC) 910/2014 on electronic identification and trusted services for electronic transactions in the internal market)     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0505	2016-06-22	NEWS	ENISA discusses cyber challenges of the digital transformation 	 Udo Helmbrecht, ENISA Executive Director, was on the global cybersecurity panel on ‘keeping pace with emerging threats’, together with S.Dacaru (Ambassador, NATO) and H. Lindberg (MSB). Panellists looked into how ‘cyber’ constitutes an element of all aspects of daily life through industry 4.0, IoT and smart environments and the protection of critical infrastructure. Udo Helmbrecht mentioned: “If you look at emerging technologies there is no doubt, room for many opportunities. But we also see the need to organise more efficiently, and take a closer look into the underlying technologies behind these new models, addressing for example technical challenges such as IT security by design. The NIS helps address key challenges through better exchange of information and prevention. We at ENISA are active in building capabilities and bringing together communities, through CSIRTs, National Cyber Security strategies, and cyber exercises”.    A video of the discussion is available  https://vimeo.com/172960254 and online, follow #CCSummit For more information: Connected Citizens' Summit     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0506	2016-06-17	NEWS	Discussing the impact of cybersecurity in DSM and EU growth	 Paulo Empadinhas in his keynote speech gave an overview of the challenges of the DSM, highlighting there are still gaps to be addressed and a more joint-up approach is required to step up supply of more secure solutions by EU industry, and stimulate take-up by enterprises, public authorities, and citizens. “We witness a lack of education regarding security: from school, academia and in private companies. Education should bring a stronger awareness about the need for security in products, both from the supplier side and the customer. Similarly, a lot of EU companies invest in IoT as a business enabler, however they don’t invest in security. In addition, security as we know it does not apply to the IoT environment, hence new frameworks are required to analyse risks” said Paulo Empadinhas. ENISA through its work, supports EU Member States in implementing the requirements of the NIS Directive, and initiatives such as the eIDAS, GDPR, which stimulate trust across different stakeholders and support industry policy in cybersecurity. Furthermore, ENISA encourages the use of standardisation - a main pillar in creating the EU single market – which helps support market-based competition, removes market barriers and helps ensure interoperability. The conference is the European extension of the Annual Security Conference taking place in Las Vegas (USA) for over a decade gathering participants from academia, government and industry to look into ‘the future of cybersecurity’.

ENISA_NEWS_0507	2016-06-17	NEWS	ENISA study looks into the adoption of security and privacy standards by SMES	 An extensive analysis was conducted for the study, in order to investigate the perceived adoption of security and privacy standards in European SMEs; as well as the main drivers and barriers that can affect the level of adoption of these standards. The methodology consisted of interviews with subject matter experts and analysis of available studies in the area. As European SMEs are increasingly dependent on their information systems to provide services to customers and meet business objectives, the use of new technologies brings new opportunities for enhanced business performance and operations but also introduces several information security and privacy risks. New information security and privacy standards are being drafted and proposed to support organizations to mitigate these associated risks. Within this context, a wide and effective adoption of information security and privacy related standards by SMEs across Europe can be a beneficial factor for fostering their growth, competitiveness and innovation. The recommendations on how to increase adoption are targeted to EU and MS policy makers, standards developing organizations, and professional, industry and small businesses associations.For the full report: Information security and privacy standards for SMEs   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0514	2016-06-03	NEWS	Overview from ENISA's Trust Services Forum 2016 	 The forum organised by ENISA  in collaboration with the European Commission eIDAS Task Force, the Trust Services Forum 2016, for the second consecutive year, aims to provide an annual opportunity for exchange of ideas to the communities closely related to the eIDAS Regulation, namely Trust Service Providers, Conformity Assessment Bodies and Supervisory Authorities. The agenda consisted of a series of presentations, panels and open sessions set in place to discuss the latest developments in the regulatory framework, to exchange views on identified implementation and operational issues of qualified trust services and to discuss strategies to strengthen the position of Qualified Trust Service Providers in the Digital Single Market.  On the eve of the entry in force of the provisions related to trust services of the eIDAS Regulation, Member States’ authorities and European Trust Service Providers are confident that a smooth transition from the previous regulatory framework will take place. However, more guidance on many areas is still needed, the experience acquired from the provision of electronic signatures under Directive 1999/93/EC has set up an important basis for the provision of new trust services under eIDAS Regulation.  The Forum was established as a periodic event following the positive feedback received from participants of the first edition, which took place in June 2015.With this event, complementing other activities in the area of trust services, ENISA continues its efforts to achieve a successful implementation of the eIDAS provisions for qualified trust services in Europe. The Agency is supporting the European market of trust services, which are a basic pillar to build a secure digital Europe.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0521	2016-05-20	PR	Europol in cooperation with the European Institute of Public Administration hosts conference on privacy and security online 	 The conference saw participation from different organisations, public and private, such as the European Data Protection Supervisor, the Europol Joint Supervisory Body, the EU Agency for Network and Information Security -ENISA, Eurojust, Amnesty International, the EastWest Institute and many others from a broad range of professional backgrounds, representing private industry, academia, privacy advocates and law enforcement.   In several high-level discussion panels and workshops lively discussions took place on the polarizing challenges around privacy versus security online, and the need to protect citizens’ privacy while giving law enforcement the means to investigate crime. There was general consensus that the availability and use of encryption and anonymity technologies is not only important and legitimate in many circumstances but essential to a secure and safe cyberspace. One of the main themes at the conference was the dichotomy that encryption and anonymity online presents for law enforcement in terms of supporting strong encryption and opposing any technical solution that would weaken security in cyberspace for everyone, and the criminal abuse of these technologies, which seriously impedes on law enforcement’s ability to protect citizens from criminal and extremist behaviour, and to bring those responsible to justice. As highlighted by Europol’s Director Mr Wainwright, the challenges for law enforcement are very real and lead to a loss of investigative opportunities as a result of the growing misuse of legitimate anonymity and encryption services and tools for illegal purposes. For law enforcement, therefore, the key aspect is to define the modalities of lawful access, within well-defined and regulated boundaries, while fully respecting fundamental rights. Echoing the need for well-defined and regulated boundaries, ENISA's Executive Director Prof Dr Helmbrecht advised: “Do not weaken encryption on purpose; do not inhibit the use of tools for data protection and privacy: promote secure IT. Rushed legislation is often inadequate legislation, we need to give time to discuss and invest into R&D” The event provided a unique opportunity to have an open, inclusive and transparent debate among different viewholders towards finding a way to strike the right balance between freedom and security online. At the end of the conference, Mr Helmbrecht and Mr Wainwright issued a joint statement describing the challenges and proposing possible avenues of solutions for lawful criminal investigations that respect 21st century data protection. Europol is the EU's law enforcement agency, assisting national authorities by exchanging information, intelligence analyses and threats assessments. The agency deals with terrorism and international crime such as cybercrime, drug smuggling and people trafficking. Europol, which has over 1 000 staff members, has its headquarters in The Hague in the Netherlands. ENISA is a centre of expertise for cyber security in Europe. ENISA’s mission is to contribute to securing Europe’s information society by raising awareness of network and information security and to develop and promote a culture, of network and information security in society for the benefit of citizens, consumers, enterprises and public sector organizations in the Union.

ENISA_NEWS_0523	2016-05-16	NEWS	ENISA recommendations for qualified website authentication certificates	 The report targets all participants in the European trust service markets. Both regulators and supervisors from Member States, as well as Trust Service Providers, can find useful recommendations on how to promote the deployment of this new type of qualified trust service. The report is divided in several sections. In its introductory chapters, the study describes the main concepts around qualified website authentication certificates, both in the context of existing commercial certificates and the eIDAS Regulation. The next sections present an analysis of the electronic certificates market and a SWOT analysis for the introduction of qualified website authentication certificates. The objective is to identify internal and external factors that can impact positively and negatively the growth of the adoption of this new kind of trust services in Europe and the development of the related market. As of 1st July 2016, European Trust Services Providers will be able to provide this new type of qualified trust service. With this report, ENISA aims to support a smooth and rapid deployment. During 2016 ENISA will be following up on this topic by undertaking more activities in the area of trust services, some of them which build upon the recommendations proposed in the report.

ENISA_PR_0536	2016-04-04	PR	“Experience is a good school. But the fees are high”. ENISA urges decision makers to take action before a major cyber crisis occurs in Europe	 The report resulting from this study highlights the lessons that can be learnt from other sectors and that could be applicable in the cyber domain.The study concludes with a series of recommendations regarding EU-level priorities to alter the impact of potential cyber crises. More recently ENISA published a video related to this study that summarises the conclusions based on testimonials from experts in other sectors. This ENISA study provides an overview of the current state-of-play of EU-level crisis management and offers an analysis, from a cyber crisis perspective, of numerous lessons learnt and challenges from decades of crisis management in the following sectors: aviation, civil protection, border control, counter-terrorism and health and disease control. The study takes a step further by providing five key recommendations on how to raise maturity in EU-level cyber crisis management. The study is based on a thorough review of the key legal and policy documents and interviews with key experts of the sectors in scope. Currently cyber crisis management at an EU-level lacks the proper mechanisms and consistency to support effectively the EU-wide cyber community in the event of a cyber crisis, despite a number of recent initiatives within the NIS community. “The message we try to pass with this study is that the effective mitigation of any type of crisis caused by cyber incidents does not only depend on the mitigation of the impacts of that crisis. It depends also very much on the effective mitigation of the cyber incidents which caused it. Today, EU decision-makers are in the privileged position to take action before such a cyber crisis occurs; this study offers insight into what can be done” said Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA. The key five recommendations by ENISA regarding priorities to reinforce the EU-level capabilities to manage effectively the next cyber crisis are as follows: The European Commission together with the EU Member States should revisit the current EU legislation on cyber crisis management to better reflect the distinction between cause and effect and better leverage on the development of the cyber crisis management field as an essential tool for the mitigation of crises caused by cyber incidents. The EU Member States should develop and formally adopt an EU-level crisis management plan, specific to the crises induced by cybersecurity incidents. The European Commission and the EU Member States should create an EU-level pool of cyber experts with the primary objective to exchange information and best practices. The Member States should develop and formally adopt EU-level cyber standard operating procedures (SOPs). The European Commission should fund the design and development an EU-level cyber crisis cooperation platform to offer support to cyber crisis management and cooperation activities between the Member States, in conjunction with the Core Service Platform of the Cyber Security Digital Services Infrastructure (of the Connecting Europe Facility funding program). ENISA is fully committed to support the European Commission and the EU Member States in implementing these recommendations.  To gain an insight into what is at stake, prior to reading the report, watch the introductory video with key European experts in crisis management from EEAS, Eurocontrol and ACI.  Notes to editors: Within its policy area, ENISA has been supporting the field of European cyber crisis management for several years with activities ranging from crisis simulations to trainings, supporting EU Member States in developing their crisis plans and structures, international conferences and reports such as this.

ENISA has produced a report on maturity (i.e. quality and technology readiness) assessment of Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs). The report firstly, sketches a methodology for gathering expert opinions and measurable indicators as evidence for a two dimensional rating scale. Secondly, the report reviews two pilots to test the proposed scales and methodology. The results of these pilots are presented in this study. In addition, a list of necessary steps towards a PET maturity repository is made available. For Whom. This report is meant for Data Protection Authorities (DPAs), groups such as the Internet Privacy Engineering Network (IPEN), data controllers, data processors, developers of IT products, researchers, educators and their funding agencies, standardisation bodies, and policy makers. What is next. In 2016 ENISA will further detail out this structured assessment process for PETs. ENISA will concentrate efforts on turning the methodology into a tool that supports a standardised step-by-step walk-through for the assessment of both readiness and quality of a PET.

ENISA’s Executive Director delivered the keynote speech on ""European and national rules and regulations in the field of cyber security"" during the European Cyber Security Conference, sharing insights into the key developments in the upcoming NIS Directive and the GDPR, and how these translate in practice for the involved actors. Digital service providers (DSP) such as search engines, cloud services, the online marketplace and essential service provides (ESP) in the banking, energy, transport sectors are affected by the establishment of incident reporting and security requirements of the new regulatory framework; areas in which ENISA is particularly active. Helmbrecht gave an overview on the proposed provisions and how these set the foundations for improved risk assessment, threat intelligence, response, and harmonisation across the EU. In this context opportunities for the internal market and e-services can be realised by reinforcing trust for services and products. “ENISA through its recommendations and solutions can support industry in producing solutions that capitalise on security as a differentiating factor and promote cooperation among all stakeholders towards approaches which can fit and stimulate the sector”.

ENISA_NEWS_0542	2016-03-09	NEWS	Guidelines on assessing the impact of incidents in the telecom sector 	 Economic development is strongly related to the well-functioning of telecommunication networks which have become the backbone of modern economies. Disruptions due to incidents in these networks, can truly impact the business, the overall wealth of the economy, other providers and possibly affect other nations. Measuring the impact of incidents has become one of the toughest challenges nowadays, given the multitude of factors and indicators that must be taken into consideration. To address this issue, indicators are used, accompanied by thresholds, to assess the impact of incidents. This approach allows the evaluation of incidents from various perspectives, such as the business perspective, compliance with regulations, root causes, impact on customers and others. Measuring the impact of incidents has become a necessity nowadays due to legal and business requirements. ENISA's new report provides a useful list of common indicators for measuring the impact of incidents. The report was compiled by collecting ideas from both NRAs and providers. Indicators are provided for the following areas: User/connection related indicators Time/duration related indicators Geographic area related indicators  infrastructure and services affected related indicators Root cause dependent indicators Economic impact related indicators  Cyberattacks related indicators Full report is available here For technical information: Dan Tofan, NIS Expert, email: Dan.Tofan@enisa.europa.eu For media and press enquiries please contact press@enisa.europa.eu, Tel: +30 2814 409576     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0544	2016-03-03	NEWS	The Netherlands - NCSC publishes factsheet Disable SSL 2.0 and upgrade OpenSSL 	 On 1 March, a group of researchers presented the DROWN attack methods for TLS. An attacker uses DROWN to abuse servers that still support SSL 2.0. Servers that run a vulnerable version of OpenSSL can be abused in the same way, regardless of whether they support SSL 2.0. An attacker who is able to intercept network traffic that is secured with TLS, may attempt to decrypt this traffic using the vulnerable server. This allows him to inspect the traffic. The NCSC advises to always configure TLS on the basis of the IT security guidelines for Transport Layer Security. Therefore, disable SSL 2.0, install the most recent updates of OpenSSL and prefer cipher suites that provide forward secrecy on all servers. This factsheet is aimed at IT administrators, information security professionals and IT managers.  Download the factsheet: NCSC Factsheet For more information: NCSC Announcement   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0545	2016-03-02	PR	Increasing the resilience of Europe’s telecommunication infrastructures through Incident Reporting 	 Experiences from this scheme can also serve as a model for the implementation of the forthcoming NIS Directive in other sectors. The first mandatory, EU-wide incident reporting scheme, aimed at ensuring the security and integrity of EU telecommunication networks and services, turned out to be an unparalleled success. In a European Union which was highly diversified in terms of telecoms security measures, art. 13a of the Framework Directive 2009/140/EU within the Telecom Package, brought a certain amount of uniformity in terms of security of telecommunication services. More importantly it contributed to strengthening the resilience and services availability of the European telecoms infrastructure all across the EU. Improvements were achieved in a balanced way as some Member States had already met requirements set, whereas others felt the benefits that far outpaced costs and effort provided. The EU incident reporting activities have been developing for four years now, with an annual growth rate of 25-30% in the number of incidents. The consolidated impact evaluation done by ENISA, to measure performance in this period, has brought to light some important findings of the incident reporting mechanism that include: A minimum set of services (fixed and mobile telephony, fixed and mobile internet) are covered by all Member States, in terms of incident reporting and security measures, but some of them went even further and covered a much broader range of services from broadcasting networks (TV, radio) to country code top level domains (CC TLDs), public WIFIs, and Internet exchange points (IXPs). Harmonization among Member States implemented regulations has been found to be satisfactory at this point, although gaps can still be observed. Additional improvements could be carried out, especially in the area of networks and services in view of new regulation. System failures (66%, e.g. software bugs and hardware failures) along with human errors (20%, e.g. cable cuts) are the top root causes disrupting EU telecommunications infrastructures, and ENISA will concentrate upon those in future studies. Third party failures have recorded an increase since last year and continue to represent an important cause for disruptions (16% of all incidents in 2014, 11% in 2013), asking for further developments in areas like supply chain security. Prof. Dr Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, commented: “Achieving resilience in the EU telecom sector is one of the main building blocks of a strong digital society. ENISA will continue supporting developments in this area and deploy its expertise in the implementation of similar requirements of the NIS Directive in other sectors.” Further analysis is required to draw some strong conclusions on next steps needed in this area. Topics like security measures to be implemented by electronic communications providers, transparency at national level and cross-border collaboration, still need further analysis as they could not be properly assessed within this study due to their complexity. The results of this report along with the work done within Art. 13a Expert Group is to be used as an input for the current review of the telecom package that the European Commission has been promulgating.

ENISA_NEWS_0551	2016-02-19	NEWS	Cryptographic tools are important for civil society and industry 	 The availability of strong and trustworthy cryptographic tools is an important building block of a society and economy that is more than ever depending on electronic services. The legitimate need to protect communication among individuals and public and private organizations has often been depicted as threat to business models or even public security. At the same time, the lack of trust in digital services has been identified as an inhibiting factor for the digital market. This has a particular weight in view of the new agreements on the NIS directive and General data protection regulation, which foster the trust of public and private sector to digital networks and services at a national and EU level. However, in the light of terrorism and crime prevention, opinions have been voiced that cryptographic tools need to be regulated. ENISA's paper on the subject looks into several aspects of crypto regulation and their difficulties from a technical perspective. Key points ENISA focuses on are: The use of cryptography might make lawful interception harder and by this less efficient or even ineffective. While key recovery and escrow might enable lawful interception, it introduces new technological risks to IT infrastructure and it might even damage the gathered evidence. It is easy to bypass systems that allow key escrow or recovery; evidence for bypassing will only be found during investigation. Vulnerabilities that where left from legacy policy have been abused to attack systems. Further, policy that limits the use of cryptography in commercial products can damage IT industry. Cryptography provides the tools necessary to protect assets in a highly computerised world. In the light of terror attacks and organized crime, law enforcement and intelligence services have requested to create means to circumvent these protection measures. While their aims are legitimate, limiting the use of cryptographic tools will create vulnerabilities that can in turn be used by criminals and terrorists, and lower the trust in electronic services, which eventually will damage industry and civil society in the EU. The issues mentioned are mere examples of currently widely used protection measures. Emerging privacy enhancing technologies might introduce even more challenges. To overcome these issues, ENISA is eager to support the Member States and competent EU bodies to perform further analyses and to define a balanced approach to move forward.

PETs refer to technologies/tools that can support users in safeguarding their privacy and personal data, especially when using online applications and services. Examples of PETs include tools that can offer protection against online tracking, as well as tools providing encryption and secure messaging functionality. A strengthened legal regime for the protection of personal data Furthermore, ENISA welcomes the new General Data Protection Regulation modernising the current legal framework, especially in relation to the processing of personal data in the digital era. This development is an important step forward for enhancing privacy protection of EU citizens and for promoting privacy and security as core aspects of the European industry. ENISA’s work in the field comprises in translating legal obligations into technical solutions, in particular with regard to the security of personal data, privacy and data protection by design and PETs, personal data breach notifications, as well as mechanisms for user empowerment (transparency and control) in digital environments. Relevant studies available online by ENISA: Online privacy tools for the general public: towards a methodology for the evaluation of PETs for internet and mobile users The study provides a review of existing web portals promoting the use of online privacy tools by the general public, proposes a methodology for evaluating the reliability and usability of online PETs, and presents a pilot evaluation and comparative presentation of PETs in the area of anti-tracking browser extensions. Privacy by design in big data: An overview of privacy enhancing technologies in the era of big data analytics The study aims at highlighting privacy as a core value of big data by providing an analysis of the privacy by design principles in the big data value chain and presenting a set of PETs that are particularly applicable in big data analytics.    Privacy and data protection by design The report contributes to bridging the gap between the legal framework and the available technological implementation measures by providing an inventory of existing approaches, privacy design strategies, and technical building blocks of various degrees of maturity from research and development. Readiness analysis for the adoption and evolution of PETs This report aims at developing a methodology that allows to compare different PETs with regard to their maturity, i.e., their technology readiness and their quality concerning the provided privacy notion. Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in EU Member StatesThe report identifies the gaps between available training courses, certifications and NIS education needs (with particular emphasis on online privacy) and proposes further actions in the field. Study on cryptographic protocols The report focuses on the current status in cryptographic protocols and encourages further work by researchers and organisations in the field. Algorithms, key size and parameters report 2014The study is a reference document providing a set of guidelines to decision makers, in particular specialists designing and implementing cryptographic solutions for personal data protection within commercial organisations or governmental services for citizens.

ENISA_PR_0560	2016-01-29	PR	Defending the smart grid – how to protect networks and devices from cyber attacks	 Smart grids are a fundamental component of the European critical infrastructure. They are rooted on communication networks that have become essential elements allowing the leveraging of the “smart” features of power grids. Smart grids provide real-time information on the grid, perform actions when required without any noticeable lag, and support gathering customer consumption information. On the downside, smart grids however, provide an increased attack surface for criminals; for instance, smart meters can be hacked to cut power bills as happened in Spain in 2014 or due to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack or malware infection, communications and control of the network could be lost, causing an energy production halt and affecting several systems across borders. To protect networks and devices from cyber threats, this study focuses on the evaluation of interdependencies to determine their importance, risks, mitigation factors and possible security measures to implement. There is high exposure of smart grid devices that makes it essential to harmonize the current situation by establishing common interconnection protocols. It has also become imperative to seek aligning policies, standards and regulations across the EU to ensure the overall security of smart grids. These aspects have currently grown in importance due to the risk that cascading failures could result since smart grid communication networks are no longer limited by physical or geographical barriers, and an attack on one country could transgress physical and virtual borders. The recommendations of this report are addressed to operators, vendors, manufacturers and security tools providers in the EU and they include the following: foster intercommunication protocol compatibility between devices originating from different manufacturers and vendors develop a set of minimum security requirements to be applied in all communication interdependencies in smart grids implement security measures on all devices and protocols that are part, or make use of the smart grid communication network. ENISA's Executive Director, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, commented: “ENISA pursues the goal of improving the resilience of smart grid security systems against cyber threats. This report provides much needed guidance to defend the smart grid and protect networks and devices from cyber-attacks”. In 2016 ENISA continues its efforts alongside the European Commission, as well as smart grid operators, vendors, manufacturers and security tool providers to secure the future of the smart grids. Furthermore the Agency will continue to coordinate SISEC, a reference group of security experts, representing national cyber security authorities, energy and ICT industries, that aims to support ENISA activities towards higher maturity in the EU’s smart infrastructures’ cyber security.

ENISA_PR_0561	2016-01-27	PR	ENISA’s Cyber-Threat overview 2015 	 ENISA’s Threat Landscape 2015 (ETL 2015) published today is the fifth yearly report in sequence, summarizing top cyber threats encountered in 2015. Building upon the achievements of the Cyber Security Strategy of the EU, this work delivers important input for the identification of emerging trends in cyber security. For yet another year the 2015 edition of the cyber-threat landscape features a number of unique observations, the main one being the smooth advancement of maturity. As a matter of fact, cyber-space stakeholders have gone through varying degrees of further maturity. While the friendly agents – the good guys – have demonstrated increased cooperation and orchestrated reaction to cyber-threats, hostile agents – the bad guys – have advanced their malicious tools with obfuscation, stealthiness and striking power. Besides elaboration on top threats, ENISA work on threat landscape has delivered some additional material targeting various stakeholder groups: A brochure with the seven most important conclusions from the 2015 threat analysis. This material targets the wider public, including policy makers, end-users, students and educators. A poster with the top 15 cyber threats assessed. This material targets the wider public, such as end-users, students, educators, etc. Threat assessments for two emerging technology areas: Software Defined Networks and Big Data. These reports - also referred to as thematic landscapes - deliver threat exposure of assets and identify good practices for protection, together with the security gaps identified. A threat taxonomy, being a tool for classifying and structuring information security and cyber threats. Udo Helmbrecht, ENISA’s Executive Director, commented on the project: “Identification of threats and their dynamics in cyber-space is key in understanding asset exposure and risks. It is an important piece of knowledge that allows for understanding protection requirements, raising awareness and allowing for a better, yet more efficient assessment of risks. ENISA continues with providing strategic information in that area through its ENISA Threat Landscape. Together with the thematic landscapes, this work is a unique publicly available source providing both strategic and tactical intelligence on cyber-threats, tailored to the specific needs of a large amount of stakeholders.” The ETL report and related material can be found under the ULRs: Brochure: Cyber 7: Seven Messages to the Edge of Cyber-Space ETL 2015 Cyber Threats Poster ETL 2015 Thematic Landscape Software Defined Networks Thematic Landscape Big Data ENISA Threat Taxonomy For technical information and interviews: Dr Louis Marinos, Expert in Network and Information Security, ENISA email: louis.marinos@enisa.europa.eu, Tel: +30 2814 409 682For media and press enquiries please contact press@enisa.europa.eu, Tel: +30 2814 409576     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0564	2016-01-21	PR	Significant increase in cyber threats to critical services and infrastructures calls for enhanced cooperation among private and public sector stakeholders 	 Citizens and businesses depend on information and communications infrastructure to support online critical services (e.g. energy, telecommunications, healthcare). Increased cyber threats can impact greatly the provision of services and result in loss of money and reputation damage for businesses. EU Member States and the private sector alike need to co-operate with each other if they want to effectively address these threats today. Yet, only half of the examined countries have established such cooperation models as public–private partnerships, working groups and contact forums.  As some sectors, like finance, telecommunications, and energy are more tightly regulated than others, security requirements differ greatly across sectors and for different types of CII operators. Just a small number of countries have implemented mandatory security requirements across sectors. This study points out that a few countries, especially the ones with a more decentralised CIIP approach, delegate their national risk assessment to sector-specific authorities or to operators of CIIs. Some countries believe that market pressure will give CII operators sufficient incentives to invest in additional security measures. However, almost none of the examined Member States have implemented incentives to invest in CIIP-related security measures for operators of CII. Following the validated results of the study ENISA proposes Member States and EU Commission to: conduct a thorough national risk assessment establish cooperation between public and private stakeholders define baseline security requirements to support CIIP development in the MS implement incentives that could motivate CII operators to invest more on security measures Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, said: “Emerging threats to critical information infrastructure constitute a clear and present danger. One which can only be mitigated by coordinated efforts. ENISA works with public as well as private stakeholders to make sure that CIIP is a priority at EU level”. ENISA provides advice, recommendations and assistance to the EU Member States in implementing relevant EU legislation. The agency engages stakeholders and the industry in exchanging good practices, information and ideas towards the improvement of CIIP in Europe. In the light of the upcoming NIS Directive and based on the findings of this report, ENISA will continue working on CIIP matters by engaging public and private stakeholders to define baseline security requirements and a harmonised approach to incident reporting.Full report: More findings and additional information about the study: Stocktaking, Analysis and Recommendations on the protection of CIIsFor technical information:  Anna Sarri, Officer in NIS, Anna.sarri@enisa.europa.euFor interviews and press enquiries please contact press@enisa.europa.eu, Tel: +30 2814 409576     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0567	2016-01-19	PR	ENISA’s ten messages to industry at Berlin IT security forum	 “Technological developments such as Internet of Things, Big Data and Smart Devices are becoming the driving force behind many IT companies. Issues related to security and privacy, if not addressed appropriately, may have an impact on the growth of the IT market” said ENISA’s Executive Director, Udo Helmbrecht, discussing on the state-of-play of IT security at a panel with German Federal Minister of Economic Affairs and Energy, Sigmar Gabriel, and industry representatives including Rüdiger Stroh (NXP Semiconductors), Vera Schneevoigt (Fujitsu) and Thorsten Dirks (BITKOM). At the forum, organised by the German Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy, on January 19th, Helmbrecht, noted the need for cooperation among all stakeholders is fundamental in order to build on concrete approaches which can fit and stimulate the sector. “ENISA promotes the development of approaches to security that are not hampered by national restrictions or particular communities so that solutions are cost-efficient and interoperable across the EU”. The recent agreements on the NIS directive and the European General data Protection Regulation (GDPR) impose new network and information security requirements on operators and digital service providers, and require incident and privacy breach reporting, subjecting companies to change their operating model and comply with more stringent specifications. ENISA focuses on establishing a high level of cybersecurity across all industry segments, and ensure cybersecurity acts as an enabler for industry to capitalise on as a differentiator factor for products and services. ENISA recommends to: Consider new business models that capitalise on security as a differentiator of products and services. Establish sectorial requirements for information security in order to move the cybersecurity market. By creating common requirements representative of entire industry sectors, industry can influence supply and move the market to reflect their needs. Reduce Operational Expenditure by Improving Risk Management Secure the whole lifecycle of products by using security and privacy by design. Equally, it is important to validate the security of the supply chain and to ensure the secure integration of all components together. Improve cooperation within and across industry segments and national borders to improve threat intelligence and promote the application of good practices. Opportunities exist for closer collaboration with EU policy makers, to improve the competitiveness of EU industry in the global market. Notable examples include the DSM, GDPR initiatives. Improving threat intelligence and spreading best practice, benefits all industry players and reduces costs.  ENISA’s recommendations and the full paper are available online.

ENISA_PR_0568	2016-01-18	PR	New good practice guide by ENISA on disclosing vulnerabilities	 ENISA publishes a good practice guide on Vulnerability Disclosure, aiming to provide a picture of the challenges the security researchers, the vendors and other involved stakeholders are confronted with when disclosing software/hardware vulnerabilities. The study gives a glimpse into the complex vulnerability disclosure landscape by taking stock of the current situation, identifying the challenges and good practices and proposes concrete recommendations for improvement. The main part of the report, describes the main concepts behind vulnerability disclosure along with some figures of the number of vulnerabilities disclosed in the past 13 years. In continuation the key stakeholders involved in the vulnerability disclosure process along with their roles are defined as well as 4 case studies of disclosed vulnerabilities. ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht commented: “Nowadays vulnerability disclosure implies a lot of complex interdependencies which can be tackled only in coordinated manner by the parties involved in the process”. This study is the first attempt to provide a reference guide on the topic of vulnerability disclosure. ENISA welcomes the opportunity to support further work in the field by promoting good practices, increasing awareness, research and further development in this complex domain”. The gaps commonly found in vulnerability disclosure are related to legal implications, lack of awareness among the stakeholders and difference in maturity levels among vendors and among researchers.Core recommendations for improvement include: •             The community must facilitate the improvement of vendor maturity •             Internationalisation through policy learning, meaning the internet requires a more transnational approach to the topic of vulnerability disclosure, successful stories can be considered. •             Introduction of a neutral third party or enhancement of existing coordination centres. •             European policy makers and Member States should improve the legal framework involved in the disclosure •             Vendors should facilitate trust building, transparency and openness •             ENISA could facilitate and advise to improve the vulnerability disclosure landscape to the community and EC. In addition, the report offers a ‘vulnerability disclosure policy template’ providing the procedural steps and timing that can be followed by the constituency in order to implement a vulnerability disclosure policy. The overall conclusion is that even though there are many positive aspects in the area, there is still room for improvement, which can be identified to an appropriate legal landscape and more trust and transparency between the involved parties.

ENISA_PR_0570	2016-01-12	PR	Boarding towards a safe and secure Public Transport. Mind the gap!	 In smart cities, Intelligent Public Transport (IPT) rely on IoT and cyber-physical systems to retrieve, process, and exchange data. These technologies bring improvements in the service and the quality of life of citizens. With these emerging technologies, cyber threats have raised on Intelligent Public Transport. Recently, a transport system was disrupted for several days due to radio interference with telecommunication systems; failures of ICT central servers has led to the global outages of a metro system; smart tickets have been hacked for fraud. These threats have an impact on the business and potential consequences on the health and safety of citizens. Yet, IPT operators and municipalities are only gradually coming to terms with the consequences of cyber threats. Current limitations include the lack of corporate governance for IPT security and associated investments; difficulties to integrate security for safety systems as cyber security for IPT remains unclear; as well as the lack of a common EU approach to intelligent public transport security. Through two studies, ENISA raises awareness and provides practical solutions to enhance cyber security. For that purpose, ENISA proposes several key recommendations: The European Commission and Member States should foster knowledge exchange and collaboration in cyber security among industry, Member States and municipalities IPT operators should integrate cyber security in their corporate governance IPT Operators should develop a clear definition of their security requirements Manufacturers and solution providers should create products/solutions that match the cyber security requirements of IPT end-users Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, commented: 'Smart infrastructure and smart devices are no longer a thing of the future, they are currently being rolled out across the EU. ENISA sees the security of such infrastructure as being a key success factor. Ensuring adequate protection of citizens will remove barriers to implementation and help promote economic growth through innovation'. As smart cities keep growing in significance, ENISA responds by developing two guidelines that highlight good practices 1) to protect the critical assets of an IPT system and 2) to secure data exchanges between an IPT operator and other stakeholders in Connected and Smart Cities.

ENISA_NEWS_0574	2015-12-17	NEWS	Privacy by design in big data: An overview of privacy enhancing technologies in the era of big data analytics	 The extensive collection and further processing of personal information in the context of big data analytics has given rise to serious privacy concerns, especially relating to wide scale electronic surveillance, profiling, and disclosure of private data. Despite the benefits of analytics, it cannot be accepted that big data comes at a cost for privacy. At the same time technology and innovation cannot be stopped. It is, thus, of utmost importance to craft the right balance between making use of big data technologies and protecting individuals’ privacy and personal data. ENISA publishes a report on privacy by design in big data, focusing exactly on striving this balance by highlighting privacy as a core value of big data and examining how technology can be on its side.     In particular, following ENISA’s former work on privacy and data protection by design, this report aims at contributing to the big data discussions by defining privacy by design strategies and relevant privacy enhancing technologies, which can allow for all the benefits of analytics without compromising the protection of personal data. Such technologies include anonymization, the “traditional” analytics technique, the emerging area of encrypted search and privacy preserving computations, granular access control mechanisms, as well as policy enforcement and accountability. Moreover, new transparency and access tools in big data are explored, together with techniques for user empowerment and control.   For full report For interviews and press enquiries please contact: press@enisa.europa.eu , Tel. +30 2814 409576 Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0576	2015-12-17	NEWS	Online privacy tools for the general public: towards a methodology for the evaluation of PETs for internet and mobile users	 One of the most serious concerns today is the preservation of privacy when using internet and mobile applications. This concern has given rise to an increasing appearance of online tools affirming that they can offer certain privacy-preventive functionality, such as secure communication, protection against tracking, or anonymous browsing. However, in many cases the functionality of these tools is not as expected. Privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) that fail to offer what they promise can be very dangerous, as the false sense of protection can compromise the users’ personal data and negatively affect or even put in harm’s way their personal life. ENISA conducted under its 2015 work programme a study in the area of PETs  for the protection of online privacy (online privacy tools). The report is addressed to all related stakeholders, such as the PETs industry, academia, data protection authorities, and the general public, for instance internet or mobile users who would like to use specific tools for the preservation of their privacy and personal data. The objectives of the study are: a) to define the current level of information and guidance that is provided to the general public, and b) to provide a proposal for an assessment model for online privacy tools that could bring more assurance in their use, supporting their wider adoption by internet and mobile users.  In particular the study comprises of three parts, providing: A review of existing web portals promoting the use of online privacy tools by the general public. A proposed methodology for evaluating the reliability and usability of online privacy tools based on a set of predefined criteria. A pilot evaluation and comparative presentation of PETs in the area of anti-tracking browser extensions.   For the full reportFor technical information: isdp (at) enisa.europa.eu  For interviews and press enquiries press@enisa.europa.eu, Tel +30 2814 409576   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0577	2015-12-16	PR	Following extensive, multi-annual negotiations the European Parliament and European Council have reached an agreement on a new General Data Protection Regulation modernising a legal framework which dates back to the 1990s	 The Regulation gives to national competent authorities (DPAs) greater enforcement powers, strengthening their role. Moreover, it reinforces the rights of the individuals with regards to data protection in the digital era, taking into account the continuous technological developments and the increasing use of internet and mobile applications. ENISA welcomes this development, which is an important step forward for enhancing privacy protection of EU citizens and for promoting privacy and security as core aspects of the European industry. At the same time it recognizes that the Regulation sets a number of challenges. ENISA is ready and well positioned to will assume responsibility to support Member States and the European Commission to tackle these challenges, translating the new legal requirements into practical technical solutions. Privacy by design Among the new elements of the Regulation is the introduction of the ‘privacy by design’ concept to online services. Privacy by design is not one technology but rather a combination of different technical and organizational measures at the heart of the design and implementation of systems and services. Following the privacy by design concept, the Regulation asks for the deployment of privacy enhancing technologies in the EU, but it is up to the national competent authorities in synergy with the industry to decide upon the most effective application of such solutions in practice. ENISA has been exploring the role and potential of privacy enhancing technologies for a number of years and is in a very good position to support all involved stakeholders in making the right decisions. Reporting on data breaches Another important element of the Regulation, is the notification of personal data breaches. In the new framework, this obligation extends to all sectors, going beyond its current applicability to the telecom operators (under the ePrivacy Directive). This new obligation is in fact an accountability measure for the industry who, on one hand needs to take all the necessary security measures to avoid data breaches and on the other hand has to notify these breaches to the competent authorities and to the affected individuals. ENISA has provided a lot of work in this field in co-operation with national Data Protection Authorities. The Executive Director of ENISA, Udo Helmbrecht, commented on this agreement: “Enhancing privacy and data protection policies, mechanisms and tools for EU citizens is an obligation of the EU policy maker. ENISA welcomes the new General Data Protection Regulation, which gives greater role and enforcement powers to national competent authorities and reinforces the EU citizens’ right to data protection. An important element of this agreement, often underestimated, is its potential to provide a competitive advantage to EU industry by adopting privacy and data protection as its core value.”Relevant studies by ENISA:Privacy and Data Protection by Design Study on cryptographic protocols Algorithms, key size and parameters report 2014 For more on the subject and press enquiries please contact press@enisa.europa.eu, Tel. +30 2814 409576       Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0578	2015-12-16	NEWS	New ENISA Report on Regulatory and Non-regulatory Approaches to Information Sharing	 ENISA publishes its report on “Cyber Security Information Sharing: An Overview of Regulatory and Non-regulatory Approaches”. ENISA identified three types of approaches to share information on cyber security incidents: 1) Traditional regulation 2) Alternative forms of regulation, such as self- and co-regulation 3) Other approaches to enable information sharing, such as information and education schemes. Some key findings are: The prevalence of traditional regulation, alternative forms of regulation (such as self- and co-regulation) and other approaches to enable information sharing on cyber incidents, varies from country to country The frequent use of alternative types of regulatory initiatives (co- and self-regulation) in the field of information sharing on cyber incidents Different regulatory and non-regulatory approaches bring different challenges with them Trust is a key element for the success of the information sharing on cyber incidents National and governmental CSIRTs play an important role in the field  BackgroundThe study aims to present the regulatory and non-regulatory approaches of EU Member States as well as EEA and EFTA countries to share information on cyber incidents, the different sector regulation challenges of managing cyber security issues, and their key practices in addressing them. The primary target audience of this report are policy and law makers at EU and Member State level, the CSIRT community (in particular national and governmental CSIRTs), the law enforcement community and other operational communities.

ENISA_PR_0579	2015-12-15	PR	No clean bill of health for cyber security incidents in healthcare: time for a sanity check	 ENISA issues key recommendations on protecting eHealth services and infrastructuresThe potential impact of an outage in the information systems of a hospital can be extreme. The loss of service or failure of a medical device due to remote hacking (e.g. via brute force and DoS attack) can be significant. Such cyber security incidents have greatly impacted health services delivery risking lives and limb of patients and exposing institutions and health care systems to reputation risk. Healthcare is moving up on the policy agenda and it is often treated by the EU Member States[1] as a critical infrastructure. ENISA has engaged more than fifteen MS and two EFTA countries in a study to identify the measures policy makers and the private sector should take to improve the security and resilience of eHealth systems. This study focuses on three broadly used, real cases, namely Electronic Health Records, national eHealth services (for example ePrescription) and Cloud Services supporting eHealth systems. The Executive Director of ENISA, Udo Helmbrecht, commented on this report: “The complexity and interdependencies of eHealth systems have been steadily increasing. Ensuring the availability, integrity and confidentiality in eHealth is a challenging task for providers and beneficiaries. ENISA seeks co-operate with all stakeholders to enhance the security and privacy of all eHealth infrastructures and services.” The report recommends, inter alia, that: National cyber security authorities should identify critical eHealth assets and carry out risk assessments with a view to mitigate risks Policy makers should introduce baseline cyber security guidelines for eHealth infrastructures and services eHealth operators, along with public sector actors, should setup an information sharing mechanism to exchange good practices and expertise on threats and vulnerabilities. These findings were validated by numerous experts from the public and private sectors in an open workshop[2] organised together with the European Commission on 30th of October 2015. New technologies, such as cloud computing, smart devices and the Internet of Things, already provide the innovation drive eHealth needs. As cyber security challenges grow alongside services in 2016, ENISA will focus on the adoption of Cloud computing by healthcare providers and carry out an analysis regarding Smart Hospitals.

ENISA_PR_0580	2015-12-14	PR	Advancing a model of cyber security education through PPPs and cooperation	 The European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) is an EU advocacy campaign that promotes cyber security among citizens and advocates seeking to change the perception of cyber-threats by promoting education, sharing of good practices and competitions in data and information security. The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), the European Commission DG Connect and Partners have been deploying the ECSM each October for the last 4 years (Graphic Overview). Highlights of the 2015 edition: 32 countries were involved in the initiative in 2015, an increase from 2014 with 30 countries involved. ECSM 2015 ran in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia ,Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Sweden, Spain, Romania, the United Kingdom; and Iceland, Moldova, Norway, Serbia, also for the first time in Turkey. In total 242 activities were encoded in the official calendar from public and private stakeholders in 32 countries. The NIS Education Map registered an increase of courses, with 417 courses currently in 22 countries. The outreach on social media on the 1st of October alone, was 718,967 accounts reached. Number of visitors for www.cybersecuritymonth.eu peaked in October with 52,574 page views, with 71% corresponding to new visitors from all around Europe. Numerous trainings for multipliers and online calls for coordinators were supported by ENISA. The kick-off event had a global partnership organized in the presence of ITU Secretary General, general deployment with partners from the United States (such as NCSAM and DHS), and coordinators from Member States, all supported by ENISA and European Commission DG Connect. Conclusions derived from the 2015 edition: Member States and EU partner countries are interested in working in partnership for cyber security education. The number of countries involved shows a tendency for steady growth. There is however work to be done in order to increase the content distribution and content co-ownership between Member States’ Organisations with the support of ENISA. The European Commission, and other EU bodies such as EESC and Agencies continue to get involved and maintain their participation at high level. The campaign created a good environment for European but also international cooperation for cyber security PPPs (Public-Private partnerships). The community building process around the campaign is an important win. The European Commission, Member States and ENISA may choose to further develop this dimension and extend its use to content distribution on cyber security education and more. Advance planning Today, the Agency together with several MSs Coordinators and network of multipliers announces the planning for 2016.

ENISA_NEWS_0582	2015-12-11	NEWS	Is Europe ready to protect SCADA? 	 Industrial Control and SCADA systems are the heart of the European Critical Infrastructures. ENISA, as part of its activities, has undertaken several actions to support ICS stakeholders by helping them to improve their security practices and by raising awareness to both industry and the public sector. In 2015 the Agency publishes “Analysis of ICS-SCADA Cyber Security Maturity Levels in Critical Sectors”. The goal is to address and pave the road for future efforts in national and European ICS-SCADA security activities. For this reason, ENISA has analysed the current maturity levels in ICS-SCADA across European Member States and drawn conclusions on different national approaches. The aim is to present the current national ICS-SCADA security postures and to provide the stakeholders with a set of recommendations on how they can improve their practices, especially regarding critical sectors. Four 'maturity profiles' were identified. The analysis revealed also areas for improvement. As a result, a set of high level and context specific future recommendations to policy and decision makers are issued that help them raise the bar of ICS SCADA in Europe: Align ICS-SCADA efforts with national cyber security strategies and CIIP effort Develop good practices specific to ICS-SCADA cyber security Standardize information sharing among critical sectors and Member States Build ICS-SCADA cyber security awareness Foster expertise with ICS-SCADA cyber security trainings and educational programmes Promote and support ICS-SCADA cyber security research and test beds   The recommendations shall assist, both the European Commission and the Member States, in the process of building a resilient ICS-SCADA environment in Europe.  To support this, ENISA will continue to release reports and documents tackling the topic of cyber security in industrial control systems and work closely with the ENISA ICS Stakeholder Group and EuroSCSIE https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/ics-security enhancing the security of ICS SCADA in Europe http://enisa.europa.eu/scada  .   For full report Brochure on ENISA SCADA activities available for download   For technical information please contact Rossella Mattioli, Security and Resilience of Communication Networks Officer, rossella.mattioli@enisa.europa.eu , +30 2814409628 For press enquiries please contact press@enisa.europa.eu, Tel.+30 2814 409576     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0583	2015-12-09	PR	The Executive Director of ENISA speaks at EP conference of a balanced approach towards online privacy along with a trusted EU ICT sector 	 “The challenge for policy makers is to achieve a balanced approach towards privacy, with the least adverse impact on citizens’ interests and industry business”, said Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, at the European Parliament high-level conference in Brussels. The conference jointly organised by the Civil Liberties Committee (LIBE) and the Luxemburg Presidency of the Council of the EU, co-chaired by the IMCO and ITRE Committees, debates the protection of online privacy, by enhancing IT security and strengthening EU IT capabilities. ENISA welcomed the separately discussed policy areas of stimulating adoption of privacy enhancing technologies (PETs), addressing soft- and hardware vulnerabilities and the internet infrastructure as well as developing the EU potential for a strong and vital IT industry. ENISA hopes for a stimulating effect of the conference in the political debate on these closely linked policies. PETs, standardization and certification are basis for the IT industry The use of PETs such as ‘privacy by design’ are part of the IT functionality offering privacy protection compatible with and building on standard security features, and are encouraged to be applied by default. Furthermore, EU guidelines that address the development of secure soft- and hardware such as standardisation and certification, which ENISA also develops, can be promoted and applied across the EU as a means to address vulnerabilities. The introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) is an example that demonstrates their increased importance as it entails security challenges that can be partially mitigated from the network resilience aspect. However, the interplay of IoTs with software and hardware components introduces more risks and threats. In this regard, certain components of the internet architecture play an important role. Hence it is important to establish information sharing on incidents and vulnerabilities and a dialogue among the actors that can help towards a common approach to security. With regards to addressing the criticality of EU IT infrastructure, Member States have developed specific measures to protect it.  The new agreed text on the NIS directive is a positive step for a more harmonised approach and cooperation among all actors and sectors, addressing the security of the digital infrastructure (whether energy, health, transport or  finance ) in order to ensure a high-level of safety of critical systems, infrastructure and citizens. ENISA has extensive experience in these areas. With its experience good cooperation mechanisms have been developed (through CSIRTs and the Cyber Europe series exercises) that allow competent authorities together with the private sector to respond to incidents (article 13a, TSPs)[1]. “We look forward to further enhancing and strengthening our collaboration in this direction” said Helmbrecht. ENISA highlights the added-value of the cybersecurity market In the discussion the enabled values arising from cybersecurity, which could reach 640bn[2] euros for the EU economy, were highlighted. The EU cybersecurity market is underdeveloped, with an estimated value at 20bn euros growing at 6% CAGR[3]. What is important, is for the EU to establish cyber trust among citizens and industry to create a competitive EU based ICT sector, further strengthening the EU position.

ENISA_PR_0584	2015-12-09	PR	ENISA welcomes the agreement of EU Institutions on the first EU wide cybersecurity Directive and Agency’s extended role	 Following extensive negotiations the EU institutions have reached an agreement, which will support Member States in achieving a high level of network & information security that is coherent across the EU and which will pave the way for more collaboration among them. The Directive foresees significant new tasks for ENISA, strengthening its role. ENISA considers this agreement as an important step forward for securing ICT infrastructure across the EU.  ENISA welcomes the agreement on the upcoming NIS Directive, which is a significant step towards further improvements in NIS across the EU. The NIS Directive foresees a number of concrete measures to make this happen, the most fundamental of which are two co-operation mechanisms among Member States, namely the network of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT Network), to be coordinated by ENISA, and the “Cooperation group”, consisting of members of national competent authorities, the EU Commission and ENISA. Member States also have to appoint a competent national authority dealing with NIS matters. Other important measures include the requirement to produce a national cybersecurity strategy and the obligation for companies working in critical sectors such as energy, transport, finance and others to inform national authorities about incidents of significant impact. The Executive Director of ENISA, Udo Helmbrecht, commented on this agreement: “Ensuring the availability, integrity and confidentiality of critical and digital infrastructures is a challenging task for public and private stakeholders. ENISA welcomes the new tasks associated with the implementation of the NIS Directive and will continue to assist the EU Member States and the private sector in improving cybersecurity capabilities and cooperation towards the implementation of the NIS Directive and in line with the objectives of the DSM.” Background The Network and Information Services (NIS) Directive was the main legislative proposal under the 2013 EU Cybersecurity Strategy. EU’s cyber security strategy is a policy document published by the European Commission (EC), explaining a number of steps the EC will undertake, in cooperation with the Member States, public and private stakeholders and other relevant actors, in the area of cyber security.Parliament is expected to approve the agreed text on December 17 and Council the following day. EU countries will then have 21 months in which to transpose the directive into national law. CSIRT network: Since 2005 ENISA is already operating a network of national and governmental CSIRTs that is used to establish trust and enable information sharing. ENISA assists EU public and private cybersecurity experts in preventing and reacting to future crises. In particular, ENISA organises regular crisis exercises with hundreds of participants to train experts, foster cooperation amongst them and provide guidance on best practices. The Agency also provides expert trainings on crisis management, crisis planning or exercise development, conducted several studies and organised international conferences on the topic of cyber crisis cooperation. ENISA’s Cyber Security Training material was introduced in 2008, and was complemented ever since. The material contains essential material for success in the CSIRT community and in the field of operational security.

ENISA_PR_0585	2015-12-07	PR	Why Cloud adoption in the Finance Sector is still lagging	" Limitations to a consistent regulatory framework and the broad adoption of good practices deters financial institutions from taking advantage of the benefits of cloud computing. Cloud Computing is currently widely used in several sectors, however, its adoption in the Financial Sector remains low.  ENISA engaged Financial Institutions (FI), National Financial Supervisory Authorities (NFSA) and Cloud Service Providers (CSP) in a study to analyse the slow uptake of cloud services and provide possible explanations related to the speed of adoption of these services by the financial sector. This study identified several causes for this slow uptake, including: inconsistent regulatory guidelines on cloud deployment, and concerns about security and data privacy jurisdictions across EU Member States.  For example, almost half of the Financial Institutions surveyed have not developed a cloud risk assessment even though they are aware of specific risks associated with Cloud Computing.  Furthermore, although NFSAs are also aware of the risks of cloud computing, they are insufficiently informed about the security measures implemented by CSPs at all times. CSPs have difficulties offering services to Financial Institutions due to differences in security and privacy requirements across EU member states, such as the implementation of privacy requirements that are the responsibility of national Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) and not of NFSAs. ENISA, in cooperation with the European Banking Authority (EBA), held a workshop in October 2015 to further enhance and validate the results.  Participants openly discussed the challenges and debated about the possible causes and potential solutions.  Following the discussions and analysis, ENISA issues ""Secure Use of Cloud Computing in the Finance Sector"" that includes the following key recommendations: Financial Institutions, National Financial Supervisory Authorities and Cloud Service Providers should co-operate to develop a consistent regulatory framework for the secure adoption of Cloud computing based on widely used good practices and standards, Financial Institutions should develop and implement a risk assessment approach to cloud computing and integrate it with existing corporate risk management processes Cloud service providers should do their utmost to enhance the transparency of their service offerings and comply with any regulatory provision and widely accepted good practices and standards in the area. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, said: “The secure adoption of cloud computing will offer significant competitive advantages to the financial institutions. ENISA will work with all relevant stakeholders to support in this direction”. ENISA continues to work with communities and industry in order to bring knowledge and provide assistance in dealing with information security issues in a specific sector.  The agency is engaged through different working groups in the area of Finance to provide exchange of information and good practices in the field of information security.

ENISA_PR_0588	2015-12-01	PR	Homing on Smart Home Security? Smart!	 Cyber security for the Smart Home is essential for the security and safety of those living and visiting it. This ENISA study proposes good security practices that enhance the security of Smart Home devices and services. Currently “Smart Home Environments” complement traditional home appliances with connected devices that collect, exchange and process data to create added-value services and enhance the quality of life of inhabitants. Emerging Smart Homes’ cyber threats such as malware on Smart TV, remote access to baby monitors etc., underscore the dependence on various technologies. As the security and privacy implications are not always clear to developers and users, they lead to possible consequences on the life, health and safety of inhabitants and visitors alike. Smart Homes face several challenges: traditional manufacturers develop connected objects with innovative functionalities but there is only a limited investment to ensure their security. The rapid development of Smart Home devices reuses several third-party components (hardware, software and services) while the security implications of these building-blocks remain a difficult aspect. In this study, ENISA proposes a holistic approach with actionable good practices to secure Smart Home devices and services. These measures seek to protect various types of devices and services found in Smart Homes in the various stages of their lifecycle: in the development, integration and usage and maintenance until end-of-life and recycling or disposal. Examples of good practices include the testing of security functions at the development stage, the secure peering of devices in the Smart Home, and continuous support for security updates. In relation to Cyber Security for Smart Homes, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA, suggests: “Smart Homes evolve at a very fast pace. Integrating connected devices to an existing environment brings new security challenges with implications on the safety of Smart Home inhabitants and visitors. To ensure safety, manufacturers and developers need to secure the entire lifecycle of their products.” The Smart Home is an important application of the “Internet of Things” (IoT). As IoT security keeps growing in significance, ENISA responds by developing guidelines for several sectors and application areas of IoT (e.g. public transport, smart cars etc.).

ENISA_NEWS_0589	2015-11-23	NEWS	Updated ENISA report reveals the Agency’s key role for the CSIRT community 	 ENISA’s latest report is a survey on ‘Capacity building activities for Computer Security Emergency Response Teams (CSIRTs)  impact analysis’ reveals the CSIRT’s community’s strong support to ENISA’s facilitator and coordinator role, as the Agency bridges the gap between the technical focus of the CSIRTs and the political focus of the Commission. The survey which was conducted among the EU and non EU-CSIRT community, EU institutions, Member State bodies, National Liaison Officers, public and private entities, clearly shows the needs and the expectations of its stakeholders. Furthermore, it has been identified that ENISA needs to take on a more proactive role and also move from paper-work support to ad-hoc, more practical support; while also provide a more tailored two-speed approach, adapting to differences in maturity between less and more mature CSIRTs. Respondents highlighted the Agency’s role with regards to its contribution towards the implementation of the Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) policy, the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union, and the implementation of the upcoming NIS Directive. Within this frame, more trust building, cooperation, training and materials were requested. ENISA has been instrumental in building and actively supporting the growing network of CSIRTs since its inception in 2005. The Agency publishes recommendations aiming to level and elevate CSIRTs capabilities and provides training material. The conducted study proposes the way forward up until 2020 and is an update of last year’s report, targeted at policy and decision-making bodies, and EU institutions responsible for the CSIRT EU Member State policy agenda, experts and the CSIRT community itself.   The full report is available online: ENISA’s CSIRT-related capacity building activities.

ENISA_NEWS_0590	2015-11-19	NEWS	The Netherlands - Cyber Security Assessment now available in English	" Cybercrime and digital espionage remain the largest threat to digital security in the Netherlands. Geopolitical developments like international conflicts and political sensitivities have a major impact on the scope of this threat. These are key findings from the Cyber Security Assessment Netherlands (CSAN), presented to the House of Representatives by State Secretary Dijkhoff in October, and now available in English. The Cyber Security Assessment Netherlands 2015 has five Core Findings: Cryptoware and other ransomware constitute the preferred business model for cyber criminals Geopolitical tensions manifest themselves increasingly often in (impending) digital security breaches Phishing is often used in targeted attacks and can barely be recognised by users Availability becomes more important as alternatives to IT systems are disappearing Vulnerabilities in software are still the Achilles heel of digital security As becomes evident from the CSAN, the trends identified in the previous Cyber Security Assessments continue in force in 2015. The introduction of an approach featuring both private and public parties, cooperating to improve cyber security both on the national and international levels, is required to tackle them. State Secretary Dijkhoff has stated that he will focus the other EU Member States' attention to the development of such an approach during the upcoming EU presidency of the Netherlands: ""Only by cooperating will we be able to protect our digital lives against crime and espionage.""

ENISA_PR_0591	2015-11-09	PR	ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht emphasises on cybersecurity enabled values for EU growth and highlights the challenges in IoT and data security	" “The EU faces a challenge, to deliver trust in Network Information Security (NIS) services and products” said Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security, ENISA, at its annual High-Level Event in Brussels on Monday 9th November 2015. Helmbrecht pointed out that the EU has to establish cyber trust among citizens and industry to create a competitive EU based ICT sector, further strengthening the EU position, and at the same time support confidence in online privacy. Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, Günther H. Oettinger, emphasized similar aspects in his keynote address on the ‘EU Perspective on Key Cybersecurity Policy Objectives’: ""The digital revolution that is changing our society and economy brings enormous opportunities. Trends such as Internet of Things, mobile health, smart mobility, smart cities, will increase ever more the already high demand for security products and solutions in Europe. Usually we look at cybersecurity through the prism of vulnerabilities and risks, but if we seize the big opportunities of the digital economy and grow stronger in this area, cybersecurity could become our competitive advantage. We need advanced cybersecurity solutions to make our digital market trustworthy and fully unlock its potential. And we need to strengthen our own cybersecurity industry to compete globally."" The event provides a platform for the exchange of information on cybersecurity between members from the Commission, Member States, policy makers, industry, experts, and academia. Each year trending topics in cybersecurity are addressed which attract the attention of high-level decision makers and leading figures in the NIS community. This year’s panel discussions explored three themes which are widely being discussed among policy and NIS circles:  ‘Cybersecurity at the Service of Industry’, ‘Aligning Cybersecurity Goals with Democratic Principles’, and ‘Identifying Challenges and Priorities for NIS in Europe’. Key participating figures included among others, Francois Thill (Representative of Luxemburgish Presidency), Paul Nemitz (DG Justice), Krum Garkov (Executive Director, eu-LISA), and Guillaume Poupard (Director General, ANSSI). Emphasizing the role and impact of ENISA in this European discussion, Udo Helmbrecht said: “ENISA through its established networks and studies - in sectors also supported through its work programme such as automotive, eHealth, IoT security -  can achieve the potential value enabled by cybersecurity for the growth of the IT security market in Europe. In this environment, the legislative procedures currently in the works will have an impact on the realisation of the Digital Single Market. The Agency already supports the legislative processes (telecommunications package, eIDAS, NIS directive, and the data protection regulation). Hence, it is in the unique position to support the implementation phase and act as an advisor, providing strategic foresight in Committees and advisory groups, creating a strong Information security community: ‘together secure’”.

ENISA_PR_0593	2015-11-03	PR	ENISA’s Udo Helmbrecht welcomes new DSiN chairman and calls for a multi-stakeholder approach 	 On the occasion of the advisory meeting of ‘Deutschland sicher im Netz e.V.’(DSiN), Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and member of DSiN’s advisory board, welcomes Dr Thomas Kremer (Deutsche Telekom) as the new chairman of DsiN, and speaks out for a targeted multi-stakeholder approach for the future work of the initiative. “‘Deutschland sicher im Netz e.V.’ (DSiN) has made a considerable contribution to increasing IT-security in Germany. Having grown substantially in the last years, now it is time to streamline DSiN’s efforts and institutionalize partnerships and cooperation with consumers, business and policy makers on all levels” said Prof. Dr. Udo Helmbrecht. Helmbrecht who talked to decision makers at the ‘Deutschland sicher im Netz e.V’ event on the 3rd November 2015, referenced ENISA’s multi-stakeholder approach, such as for example, implemented through the European Cyber Security Month. From ENISA’s perspective a multi-stakeholder approach including public and private actors, networks of multipliers and targeted relations to government is necessary to reach out to new influencers, encourage new public-private activities and to send out a clear message to all involved stakeholders with the most possible attraction by media. Helmbrecht recommends cooperating with public authorities at state level in order to “create synergies between existing programs and objectives”, for example with national data protection authorities, regulatory bodies and academia. The DSiN faces challenges with a particular national focus, but can find inspiration from the best practices at European level such as those showcased by ENISA. With its tenth anniversary just around the corner, DSiN can look back onto a decade of successfully promoting and improving IT-security in Germany, as the incorporated association of public and private organizations under the aegis of the German Ministry of the Interior, offering both, independent and targeted advice to SMEs and consumers. Over the years, DSiN has extended its membership structure, including key market players. Hence, a multi-stakeholder approach, streamlining the association’s capacities and programs, will help to best address consumers and businesses on the regional, national and EU level. ENISA takes a particular interest in public-private partnerships (PPPs) and coalitions such as that with DSiN, as these serve as good examples of what can be achieved through such networks. “ENISA looks forward to the advancement of the Digital Single Market objectives for public-private partnerships”.

ENISA_PR_0597	2015-10-21	PR	Discovering the Top Young European Master Hackers	" This is the day that has been anticipated in the past few weeks and months by the best young cyber talents in Austria, Germany, Romania, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Each country ran a national competition to form a team of its top 10 talents to participate in the final of the first European Cyber Security Challenge, an initiative supported by ENISA, the EU Agency for Network and Information Security. This year, the teams travel to Lucerne, Switzerland to compete against each other in various disciplines related to IT security. Lucerne, October 21th, 2015 – on the 21st of October, the top young European hackers meet in Switzerland to both infiltrate and secure computer systems and to uncover the wrongdoings of cyber criminals. It sounds like a scene from a movie – but that is the setting at the European Cyber Security Challenge final (ECSC). These high school and college-age students are the best up-and-coming talents in the IT security sector. The Road to Victory The young hackers have to find security vulnerabilities in web applications, decipher encrypted documents, or gain access to a protected system to prevent that cyber criminals are the first to find and exploit them. However, technical skills is just one side of the medal; soft skills like their ability to work on a team or their presentation style are of similar importance on the road to victory. “It’s not enough to simply find security problems and fix them. Working out a solution as a team and being able to communicate with others is just as important for a ‘good hacker,’’ explains Nicholas Hansen of Swiss Cyber Storm.That’s why the winning team won’t necessarily be the one with the best technical masterminds; good planning, teamwork and a strategy how to approach and distribute the different tasks is just as important.  Hacking – An unique Hobby but for people with White Hats only “One requirement for participants is that they have not completed any higher education degree in IT security (e.g., a Master’s degree in Information Security) or a related field. This means the participants acquired the majority of their knowledge in their free time” explained Steve Purser Head of Core Operations at ENISA. It is important to note that only so-called White Hat hackers are accepted to compete in the European Cyber Security Challenge. In contrast to Black Hats, white hat hackers break security for non-malicious reasons, mainly to test their own security system or while working for a security company which makes security software. The term ""white hat"" in Internet slang refers to an ethical hacker. Companies and the public sector both profit from this trend as well: the young cyber talents acquire additional skills while learning their hobby that are in high demand on the job market. “With increasing digitalization, information security considerations are becoming more and more important. Organizations rely on specialists who know how to protect their infrastructure. This includes knowing what cyber criminals are capable of and how they attack our systems. That’s one important piece in the puzzle to reliably secure systems and repel attacks,” Bernhard Tellenbach, president of Swiss Cyber Storm, explains. “The European Cyber Security Challenge is an opportunity for participants, who are not IT professionals, to test and put their digital skills at work. On the other hand it acts as a platform for the exchange of good practices among contestants, and to motivate young people to enhance and develop further their skills to tackle online threats. As practice has shown, cooperation is key to achieve cyber resilience. ENISA supports the initiative is keen on establishing the activity within the NIS community” said Steve Purser. If you wish to be among the competing teams, countries and organisers are invited to get in touch with ENISA who is organizing next year’s European Cyber Security Challenge.  Improve your skills and staying safe online! Who knows, it may lead to a career in cyber security!   Notes to editors: About ENISA: The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) is a centre of expertise for cyber security in Europe.

ENISA_NEWS_0599	2015-10-19	NEWS	"""Understanding Cloud Solutions for All"": 4th week of #CyberSecMonth "	 This week the following related material is provided for all:     1. ENISA’s work on secure Cloud adoption This year ENISA published a set of guidelines to help SMEs make an informed decision before choosing a cloud service, which is also provided as a tool! For more information please visit here. For short recommendations and the essential questions to ask before 'going cloud' visit the following link. The information is available in all EU 23 languages. ENISA also plays an important role in giving stakeholders an overview of the information security risks when ‘going cloud’. ENISA’s Cloud Security Risk Assessment is widely referred to across EU Member States and outside the EU. ENISA follows up on this by focusing on procurement and criticality of cloud services. 2. Published today #CyberSecMonth Just released: report on the “Status of privacy and NIS course curricula in Member States” The work in this report follows up on previous efforts and suggested recommendations from 2013- 2014 by ENISA. Objectives of this report are: to identify gaps between available training courses, certifications and NIS education needs with particular emphasis on ePrivacy to suggest further actions based on the analysed needs of NIS communities in Europe   From the desktop research, the focus for most of the courses that included privacy appeared to be in computer science, computer security, information security, cybercrime and the cyber security area. However there were a number of courses which included privacy law (Information Technology, Commercial, Corporate, Communications and Property), marketing and ethics. For several reasons, it may be, that privacy is an area that only relatively lately is gathering attention, compared for example to Network and Information Security. However this idea would require further future research to be proved. Within this context, existing Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) were also looked into. In terms of MOOCs, the offer around the subject of privacy and data protection is limited in general, and there is a particular lack of MOOCs in the European context both in terms of delivery by European Universities/Institutes and covering privacy and data protection legislations and debates at a European level. Furthermore, MOOCs and serious games are a path which is being explored as a practical way to transfer knowledge, support learning, raise awareness, offer professional training and unveil controversial issues and practices surrounding privacy and data protection.  ENISA’s recommendations on MOOCs courses In the final section of the report, recommendations are provided for EU level organisations, e.g. University networks, users’ coalitions and multipliers, education institutions, and also at the Member State level organisations e.g. education institutions, NGOs, think tanks, governments. Key recommendations include: Consider exploring serious games not only for raising awareness but also as a training ground for first-responders and other professionals. The report has highlighted that privacy does not seem to feature in titles of undergraduate degree courses and further research would be required to understand why. Consider to invest in MOOCs with a NIS focus, in particular addressing the issue of privacy-by-design and European legislation. We highlighted that some of the existing MOOCs are available in national languages, this is clearly an advantage and a best practice. The report has highlighted that there is scope for some specific MOOCs relating with issues currently debated at a European level. There is a general lack on privacy and data protection MOOCs in the EU context, however this delivery opportunity could be better exploited also via existing supported platforms (i.e. OpenUpEd and EMMA). Consider promoting the creation of multiple such quizzes using as basis or parts of the ENISA quiz in order to raise awareness by participating in the spread of general quizzes and awareness month.   User education is key in cyber security At the same time, ENISA has further developed a quiz (to be officially launched on Monday 26.10) to test user’s knowledge in network and information security while at the same time to disseminate best practices and knowledge from all its reports. The version 1.0 will use a better gamified approach. A relevant addition to this year’s quiz are the Cyber Security Month badges, following the model from serious games, which are awarded upon completion of the quiz and which participants can share on social media. The use of badges is also one of the measures adopted for supporting the full completion of the quiz by a larger number of participants.   For more on the subject areas and press enquiries please contact press@enisa.europa.eu Tel. 2814 409 576 European Cyber Security Month: during October, find out how to be safe online   Background: European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) is an EU advocacy campaign that promotes cyber security among citizens and advocates for change in the perception of cyber-threats by promoting data and information security, education, sharing of good practices and competitions.

ENISA_NEWS_0601	2015-10-16	NEWS	Cybersecurity Standards from an EU perspective at Secure Conference Warsaw	 ENISA’s Executive Director, Udo Helmbrecht, is participating at the 19th Security Conference on Telecommunications and IT Security in Warsaw on the 14th and 15th October 2015, at the Copernicus Science Centre, Warszawa. ENISA is proudly an honorary patron of this year’s event. On day two of the conference, Prof Helmbrecht spoke about cybersecurity standards giving an insight from the EU perspective. The subject area is continuously under the microscope as the community tries to define the term ‘cybersecurity’, ‘and what is expected with the definition of ‘cybersecurity standards’ (classification, who participates, how). Udo Helmbrecht explained the objectives towards a coordinated approach to standardisation based on consensus and approved in a recognised body. The sector’s status, the current regulation and ENISA’s role in the process for standardising cybersecurity was presented. ENISA’s role to cybersecurity standards in the EU The aim of the Agency is to promote best practices through Standards Developing Organisations (SDOs) and to act as an interface between them and the public and private sector. The goal is on the one hand to establish a formal and working collaboration with SDOs and related Working groups while on the other to review and include standards in the NIS activities and formulate proposals for standards. ENISA acts as a liaison with ISO SC27, is an active member of CSCG, has MoUs with ETSI, CEN CENELEC is in the process for a MoU with ITU, while it aligns key activities of its own with the work of SDOs in the areas of smart grids, privacy and cloud certification. In 2015 the Agency is elaborating the studies, which: will contribute to a more concrete definition of cybersecurity and identify gaps and overlaps, areas covered, and organisations involved in standardisation process presents the current governance framework of the EU standardisation, finding ways to align policy, industry and research promotes security and privacy standardisation for the SME community, through listing existing ICT S&P standards that can be used by SMEs, and recommendations to increase their adoption, and the status on of standardisation for SMEs.   “The challenge we face is lack of a consistent strategy towards standards. Shortcomings of the current approach are well recognised. At the EU level we need to improve coordination between EU funded Research and Development (R&D) and Standards Developing Organisations (SDOs). As drivers of such coordination existing initiatives could be used, such as ‘Horizon 2020’ and ETSI/CEN/CENEEC Cybersecurity Coordination Group). A concrete strategy for the ‘European Standardisation Organisations’ (ESOs) is an insisting need” said Udo Helmbrecht. “I am happy that today we are patrons of this event and I hope in the near future we will have substantial actions taking place which will decipher the sector and see the tangible results of everyone’s efforts to standardising EU cybersecurity”   Follow the event @securepl Background: The conference presented state-of-the-art solutions, analysis of the current threats, latest trends in ICT security as well as important legal issues. Participants have a unique opportunity to gain the latest knowledge, improve their qualifications and exchange experience with experts (source Secure 2015) For more on the subject and interviews please contact press@enisa.europa.eu , Tel. 2814 409576   October is Cyber Security Month!

ENISA_NEWS_0602	2015-10-14	NEWS	ENISA at #ITUWORLD	 Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, the Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Network Security and Information (ENISA), participated at the ITU Telecom World 2015 event in Budapest on the 12th-15th October 2015. Prof. Helmbrecht participated in the panel discussion ‘Accelerating Digital Innovation for Social Impact’ along with three other panellists representing the private and telecommunication sector. During the discussion, Prof Helmbrecht spoke on the need for a close collaboration between policy initiatives and technology innovation, providing notable examples of areas which offer such a potential. ENISA’s Executive Director elaborated on how the EU needs an industry policy approach to create a competitive EU based ICT industry which can be based on a variety of different ‘tools’: Promoting cooperation of EU SMEs Using public procurement to foster EU based ICT industry Further strengthening the EU leading position in relevant areas such as business software or smart cards ENISA uniquely positioned to assist EU institutions in promoting cybersecurity as a competitive advantage “There is an opportunity to use the area of cybersecurity as an economic enabler, providing EU industry with a competitive advantage in the global market. In order to do this, we need to recognize the differentiating factors that could be the basis for new business models. ENISA is uniquely positioned to assist in this direction” said Udo Helmbrecht. As ICT is the backbone of every modern society, the EU needs to become the single market of preference for governments and industry for trusted EU products and services. At another end, e-Government services have significant potential, to make public services more efficient for the benefit of citizens and businesses in terms of ‘time and money’. It is evident that as we progress into the era of IoT, all e-aspects may it be e-banking, e-health, e-commerce, e- education, will be totally dependent on an open, safe and secure cyberspace. ENISA continues its work in sector and develops a culture of information exchange among communities through studies and workshops and continuously engages with the Internet operational community through the relevant reference groups. Follow the discussions on #ITUWORLD About ITU world: The event brings together influential figures from government and industry and focuses on accelerating the digital transformation for economic growth and social good through three major tracks of debate in the Forum: accelerating digital transformation, extending digital opportunities, and building trust in the connected future*(source ITU World 2105).

ENISA_NEWS_0603	2015-10-13	NEWS	2015 Annual Privacy Forum focusing on Privacy Enhancing Technologies 	 The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security jointly with the European Commission Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT), and as local host, the University of Luxemburg organised the 3rd Annual Privacy Forum (APF) on the 7th and 8th October 2015, in Luxembourg. The two-day event brought together academia, industry and regulators with the aim of bringing research and policy together in the area of privacy and data protection. Prof Thomas Engel (University of Luxembourg), Raffaele Di Giovanni Bezzi (policy officer EC DG CONNECT) and Dr Demosthenes Ikonomou (Head of Information Security & Data Protection, ENISA) gave the welcoming notes. The meeting looked into the technical aspects and approaches to privacy, ethics, and transparency behind data processing. Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) that could support users’ needs while safeguarding their personal data were put forward to policy makers, academia and industry, as a tool for more transparent and safeguarded data analysis in the age of IoT (Internet of Things) and Big Data. In this context, ‘privacy by design’ (PbD) was examined as the element which can bring together the technical, legal and business aspects of IT, promoting it as culture (operational framework) on privacy. Key note speeches were presented by: Giovanni Buttareli (EDPS), Naomi Lefkovitz (National Institute of Standards and Technology- NIST, US Department of Commerce), Charles Raab (University of Edinburgh), Marit Hansen (Privacy & Information Commissioner of the State of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany), Paul Nemitz (DG Justice, EC), Gwendal le Grand (CNIL), Bart Preneel (KU Leuven).Safeguarding privacy, data protection in the era of big data and privacy economics: the ethical approach Prof Thomas Engel from University of Luxembourg and General Co -Chair Annual Privacy Forum 2015 said: “There are at least two perspectives: protecting the individual citizen against attacks and the interest of a society to make sure that safety is guaranteed. We are convinced that practical solutions for privacy will need multidisciplinary efforts. The Annual Privacy Forum offers an ideal platform for discussing these issues with experts from industry, data protection agencies, academia, ENISA and the European Commission. Particularly the format of the forum combines practitioners’ views with a scientific track based on peer-reviewed paper submissions and published in Springer. A number of follow-up activities have been agreed upon to further demonstrate and show-case open issues and potential solutions. I am extremely satisfied with this years’ edition of the APF.” ENISA’s Dr Demosthenes Ikonomou Head of Information Security & Data Protection, said: “This forum has brought together for yet another year diverse communities to look into state of the art approaches towards privacy, data protection and the technologies surrounding the field. ENISA places an emphasis on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) that could support users’ needs while safeguarding their personal data. A typical example of our work is  privacy by design’ (PbD) which in this forum was examined as the element which can bring together the technical, legal and business aspects of IT, promoting it as culture (operational framework) on privacy. At the same time the Agency supports the Commission on the policy process currently under way. This two day event has been an excellent platform for the community to discuss and respond in a more efficient manner to the challenges on the subject and we are eager to start preparing next year's edition”. The APF took place during the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council of the EU, and was made possible with the contribution of the APF partners, EDPS and KU Leuven, and the APF sponsors, ISACA and Symantec.

ENISA_NEWS_0605	2015-10-08	NEWS	4th joint ENISA - EC3 workshop between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement 	" On 8 and 9 October 2015 more than 40 representatives from national / governmental EU CSIRTs (Computer Security Incident Response Teams) and their law enforcement counterparts convened at Europol's headquarters in The Hague for the 4th joint ENISA - EC3 workshop. The two-day event focused on the exchange of information between CSIRTs and law enforcement placing a particular emphasis on the common taxonomies and methods to information sharing. Wil van Gemert, Europol's Deputy Director Operations, and Dr Steve Purser, Head of ENISA Core Operations, gave the keynote speeches. In his speech Wil van Gemert said: ""Law enforcement - CSIRTs cooperation is essential in bringing two of the most relevant professional communities together to tackle cybercrime. One side protects infrastructures, communities and businesses from cyber threats, while the other looks at perpetrators and enablers who are behind this crime. Working together in an efficient and effective manner is a fundamental backbone of ensuring the safety of the societies we are entrusted to protect. This event, which epitomises the excellent collaboration between Europol and ENISA, is a valuable opportunity for concrete output, providing ample possibilities to learn from practical experiences"". Dr Steve Purser underlined: ""Defining a common taxonomy between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement is an important step forward to facilitate information sharing between these two communities. Today's meeting is an important step in this direction. The feedback from the communities is fundamental in order to proceed and set the appropriate framework. ENISA and Europol are in close collaboration in their common efforts to counter cybercrime, which is to be fought from different angles. The workshop serves as an excellent platform to share viewpoints and develop a common understanding and we aim to deepen this collaboration"" ENISA and Europol have a Memorandum of Understanding for strategic cooperation and exchange of expertise supporting the EU Member States and institutions in the fight against cybercrime.

ENISA_PR_0607	2015-09-29	PR	European Cyber Security Month: during October, find out how to be safe online	" Want to find out how to stay safe online? Throughout October 2015, join one of the dozens of events, webinars, and other actions that are part of October-European Cyber Security Month (ECSM), the EU's campaign to promote cyber security, which kicks-off today in Brussels. More than 100 events and activities in 27 countries (listed underneath) will help us all protect ourselves from cyber threats through information security advice, competitions, education opportunities and sharing of good practices. The campaign's theme is ""cyber security is a shared responsibility – Stop. Think. Connect."" inviting everyone to find out more about online security and to help others protect themselves from cyber threats. The Digital Single Market Strategy will work towards stepping up the supply of more secure solutions by EU industry and to stimulate their take-up by everyone in Europe: this will be achieved mainly by the establishment of a public-private partnership on cyber security in technologies and online networks, along with a review of the ePrivacy Directive (both planned for 2016). European Cyber Security Month is being celebrated for the third consecutive year and has been organised by the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), the European Commission and over 100 partners (local authorities, governments, universities, think tanks, NGOs, professional associations) from all over Europe. The campaign also has an international reach: discover the U.S. campaign here. Vice-President Ansip, in charge of the Digital Single Market, said: ""Security against cyber-attacks has become central to consumer confidence and the online economy. But we cannot get the best out of the opportunities offered by digital tools and online networks if we do not trust them. Raising awareness of the risks and threats, and the fact that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, is vital so that when they are online, people can make better informed choices and guard against risks"" (read the full blog post).  Commissioner Oettinger, in charge of the Digital Economy and Society, said: ""To make the digital world a secure place for everyone, we all have to contribute: policy makers, research, industry, citizens. But for Europeans to fully enjoy the benefits of a safe Internet, they also need to be aware of the risks they face online and to know how they can to play an active role for their own security in their daily lives. The European Cybersecurity Month is a great opportunity to spread good practices and increase the overall level of awareness and thus of cybersecurity in the EU"". ENISA’s Executive Director, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, said: “As our societies are continuously being digitised and we are moving in the era of IoT and smart cities, e-skills and online security are essential resources that need to be developed and continuously enhanced. The Agency is developing an entire Network and Information Security (NIS) community around the Cyber Security Month initiative."" Action! Happening during October The ECSM runs for the entire month of October, with each week focusing on a different topic. 1st week – October 1-4: Cyber security training for employees 2nd week – October 5-11: Creating a Culture of Cybersecurity at Work 3rd week – October 12-18: Code Week for all 4th week – October 19-25: Understanding Cloud solutions for all 5th week – October 26-31: Digital Single Market for all The ECSM runs in Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Greece, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Ireland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Finland, Sweden, Austria, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Norway, Iceland, Croatia and Turkey.

ENISA_PR_0608	2015-09-25	PR	ITRE MEPs visit ENISA for an update on activities and cyber challenges for the EU 	 ENISA hosted a two-day visit, by EP ITRE (Industry, Research and Energy) delegation, Michal BONI and Eva KAILI, at its premises in Heraklion Crete, on the 24th and 25th September 2015. The ITRE delegation had consecutive meetings with ENISA’s Executive Director Prof Udo Helmbrecht, joined by the Head of Core Operations Department, Dr Steve Purser. The programme of their visit entailed a: Brief presentation on ENISA and the Agency’s mission and scope of its activities Presentation on flagship and major Agency projects. These include: Secure and Smart Infrastructures, Cloud computing, National Cyber Security Strategies, Incident reporting, threat landscape, certification, privacy and data protection, and supporting EC policy processes. In each case, emphasis was placed on the impact of the work. Demonstration and overview of ENISA’s training activities for the EU CSIRT community and Cyber exercises Meeting with ENISA staff for an exchange of views on the upcoming challenges in the field of cyber security within the European context and activities.   ENISA’s priorities and improving the Agency’s capacity to deliver Key discussion points were as follows: The role of ENISA in securing new technologies and business models such as m-Health and the Industry 4.0 concept. Several ideas taken from ENISA’s earlier work on ‘Digital Sovereignty’ were discussed in this context as possible next steps. In the area of EU legislation, ENISA is ideally positioned to provide support for the implementation of the Data-Protection-Regulation and the NIS directive. The Agency should consider intensifying its data collection and analysis activities in the future. ENISA could provide valuable support to the European Parliament (EP) by providing input on NIS trends on a regular basis and responding to specific questions on an ‘as required’ basis. It would also be beneficial for the Agency to become a constant element of the EP world and provide briefings or workshops for MEPs and EP groups on an ad-hoc basis e.g. STOA. There is the need to agree on a code of conduct on recommendations issued in cybersecurity. There is the need to redefine the definition of security in the EU taking into consideration the indistinct borders of the digital environment as evidenced by the cyber reality. This is not an easy task and requires a process with the aim to better secure citizens and businesses. It was noted that the ENISA budget has been essentially static for the last ten years, whereas the importance of the field of cybersecurity has grown significantly in importance. Budget and resources are now the limiting factor affecting ENISA’s ability to create further impact. It was agreed that this fact should be brought to the attention of decision makers as a matter of urgency in order to allow the Agency to respond to future challenges.   MEP Eva Kaili stated: “ENISA has built an active community of cybersecurity specialists, who play a key role in developing a common understanding and a common harmonised approach to cyber security. We must take a closer look into how we can make the best use of the Agency’s work and also how we can assist them in developing their capacities”. MEP Michal Boni said: “It has been a truly constructive visit offering valuable insight into the Agency’s flagship projects and its contribution to the area of cybersecurity. Particularly interesting was the opportunity we had to meet and discuss with the experts and gain a deeper understanding on how cyber security has become an essential element of all aspects of our daily lives, and its growing importance for citizens, business and our Member States. We need one solution for one Europe, to benefit from the future competitive advantages in the field. We are indeed satisfied with the high level of expertise and active contribution of the Agency to the EU’s level of cyber security and look forward to benefiting from their further support in this area.” ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht said: “The Agency is committed to strengthening cooperation and synergies with operational communities, and identify pragmatic solutions to current security issues. Following today’s meeting, we will aim to strengthen our support for the European Parliament by providing information on NIS trends and responding to specific questions as required.’   Related Material: ENISA Annual Report 2014 ENISA Work Programme 2015 Notes to editors: Link to photos here   For interviews and press enquiries: Please contact: press@enisa.europa.eu, Tel. +30 2814 409576     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0609	2015-09-23	PR	ENISA’s Executive Director at the 4th EP ITRE Committee meeting on Digital Union and cybersecurity 	 On 23 September 2015, ENISA’s Executive Director, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, participated at the fourth meeting of the Working Group on Digital Union of the ITRE Committee on cybersecurity at the European Parliament (EP) in Brussels. Prof. Helmbrecht spoke to the Working Group about ENISA’s role in ‘securing and enabling Europe's information society’, focusing on the Agency’s work with Europe’s Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and the facilitation of pan-European cyber exercises. ENISA counts 11 years of close collaboration with CSIRTs in Europe and around the world. Related deliverables by ENISA have either been developed or validated in collaboration with the various communities. In July, the Agency was awarded the 'Liaison Member' status by the European Computer Security Incident Response Team task force (TF-CSIRT). TF-CSIRT’s training program is partly based on ENISA material, and the Agency regularly contributes to these training sessions. About 10 EU Member States have already benefited from these activities with many more to come. ENISA’s Cyber Exercises equip EU Member States with skills to handle cyber crises The main goal of the cyber exercises conducted during Cyber Europe 2014 has been to train EU Member States to cooperate during a large-scale cyber-crisis. This year for the first time, the three-phase exercise tested all three phases of a cyber-incident response – technical, operational and strategic – and provided participants opportunities to assess the effectiveness of cooperation and escalation procedures during cross-border cyber incidents. The lessons learned from Cyber Europe 2014 are numerous and provide the basis for ground-breaking work in cyber crisis cooperation, an emerging field which EU and ENISA are leading. “At ENISA, we are committed to implementing the action plan, with the support of the Member States, to further improve cyber crisis preparedness both at the national and EU levels”, said Udo Helmbrecht. Notably, ninety-eight per cent (98%) of participants of the technical phase indicated interest to participate in the next exercise. The message put across during the meeting by the Executive Director of ENISA was that “Cybersecurity cannot be seen as a field isolated from society, restricted to experts. Instead it has become a fundamental element necessary for the smooth functioning of our internal market, both national and EU, our industry, and our citizens. ENISA’s work and activities are a unique intersection of expertise along with its knowledge of industry, stakeholder’ and policy needs, and it is the actor who can ensure a common level of understanding and facilitate significant advancements in cyber cooperation and compliance across Europe”. Related material: Guide by ENISA: Actionable Information for Security Incident Response Cyber Europe 2014:After Action Report Background info: Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) are the key tool for Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP). Teams respond to emergencies, new incidents and cyber threats that could affect vital computer networks or information systems. CSIRTs have extended their capacities throughout the years from a “reaction force” to complete security service providers, including proactive services such as alerts, security advisories, training and security management services. Cyber Exercises - Cyber Europe: ENISA is facilitating the process of planning, conducting and evaluating pan-European cyber crisis cooperation exercises, supporting EU-wide cyber security preparedness and testing national capabilities and contingency plans involving both public and private sector organisations.   For interviews and press enquiries please contact press@enisa.europa.eu , Tel.+30 2814 409576       http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/news-wires/RSS PRs: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/press-releases/RSS 	https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa2019s-executive-director-at-the-4th-ep-itre-committee-meeting-on-digital-union-and-cybersecurity
ENISA_PR_0610	2015-09-23	PR	Stronger together: ENISA releases Cyber Europe 2014 After Action Report	 ENISA releases today the public version of the After Action Report of the pan-European cybersecurity exercise Cyber Europe 2014 (CE2014). This report, approved by the Member States, gives a high-level overview of the complex cybersecurity exercise that was carried out in 2014. The main goal of Cyber Europe 2014 was to train Member States to cooperate during a cyber-crisis. The three-phased exercise provided opportunities to assess the effectiveness of cooperation and escalation procedures during cross-border cyber incidents which impact the security of vital services and infrastructure, while testing national capabilities and contingency plans involving both public and private sector organisations. The exercise, organised by ENISA on a biannual basis, was planned jointly with representatives from the participating countries and required six (6) planning conferences across Europe. This exercise, which brought together over 1,500 participants from 29 EU and EFTA Member States, covered for the first time all three (3) phases of cyber incident response - technical, operational and strategic - each escalating into the next phase involving: Phase 1 - Technical level (28-30 April 2014, 49  hours): Incident detection, analysis and mitigation, information exchanges. Phase 2 - Operation level (30 October 2014, 10 hours): Alert, cooperation, short term crisis mitigation, development of a common      situational picture. Phase 3 - Strategic level - tested for the first time -  (25 February 2015): Decision  making based on the common situational picture, high level policy debates  on long-term strategic crisis mitigation. The report shows that the common ability to mitigate large-scale cybersecurity incidents in Europe, has progressed significantly since 2010, when the first Cyber Europe exercise was carried out. Sharing real-time information among countries is proving valuable for swift decision-making. The EU Standard Operational Procedures (EU-SOPs) used to support these cooperation activities, provide Member States with guidelines, which they can use in the face of large-scale cybersecurity incidents. These will be improved further taking into account the evolving cyber security policy context in Europe. Cooperation was highlighted as a key element contributing to increased understanding, trust building, and faster response. The Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP) developed by ENISA for the exercise planning, conduct and evaluation, proved to be a powerful tool. The CEP is currently being further developed by ENISA in order to host future cyber exercises and technical scenarios. Ninety-eight per cent (98%) of participants of the technical phase indicated interest to participate in the next exercise. ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht stated: “The lessons learnt from Cyber Europe 2014 are numerous and provide the basis for ground breaking work in the area of cyber crisis cooperation, an emerging field which EU and ENISA are leading. We are committed to implement the action plan, with the support of Member States, to further improve cyber crisis preparedness both at national and the EU level.” The scenario The scenario of Cyber Europe 2014 revolved around an EU regulatory proposal related to energy resources. During the technical phase of the exercise the Member States and the EU Institutions had to deal with cyber-incidents such as exfiltration of information, open source intelligence, mobile phone malware analysis, to denial of service attacks and advanced persistent threats. The operational phase of Cyber Europe 2014 followed on with the escalation of the situation that led to a series of large-scale cyber-attacks on various critical infrastructures and numerous online services. Finally, the strategic phase of Cyber Europe 2014 escalated the crisis further, with several energy infrastructures severely impacted in the midst of a harsh winter, key critical technologies breached, and an increasingly worried public opinion.

ENISA_NEWS_0612	2015-09-16	NEWS	ENISA’s Udo Helmbrecht at the 10th Future Security Event in Berlin 	" ENISA’s Executive Director, Udo Helmbrecht, is participating at the 10th Future Security Conference taking place in Berlin from 15th -17th September 2015, at the Representation of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia in Berlin. The event hosts high-level panellists mainly from Ministries, institutions and academia. ENISA’s Executive Director Prof. Helmbrecht, delivered the keynote address on “Privacy and Data protection: an EU Perspective”, where he mentioned the latest developments in the area and spoke about how the Agency has become a point of reference on eIDAS. The Agency supports and provides guidelines for trust service providers (TSPs) on risk assessment and recommendations for incident risk mitigation, and provides guidelines on an auditing framework for trust services. Other ongoing activities the Agency is involved in include analysis of relevance and compliance of standards related to TSPs (Covering mandate M460 ""Rationalised Framework for electronic signature”), assisting the European commission (EC) in the developing implementing acts; Incident reporting for Trust Service Providers (Article 19 of Regulation 910/2014); and a strategy analysis for the introduction of qualified website authentication certificates (QWACs) promoting consumer confidence in the web authentication market. ENISA also supports the creation of a Trust Services Forum explaining to stakeholders the developments in the area of eIDAS, while offering the opportunity to discuss with regulators on important areas. “Our goal is to explain the developments on eIDAS and bring together stakeholders including regulators, and National authorities while developing non-binding technical guidelines supporting their work. Similarly with industry we aim to liaise and facilitate their involvement in the process especially in view of the upcoming entry into force of the trust services provisions of the eIDAS Regulation. Protecting data is a multi-faceted challenge. Organizational measures are needed such as access control, privacy and security policies. DPA, member states authorities, service providers need to collaborate to implement security measures” Prof Helmbrecht illustrated how ENISA supports the public sector in policy implementation through its work in the eIDAS regulation and promoting ‘privacy by design’. “We see that the research community has developed many mechanisms to implement specific privacy properties, but which don’t always match the requirements of the regulation. Privacy by design can be the tool to help make this match”. The Agency also provides its recommendations and guidelines for data protection measures to the private sector, and raises citizens’ awareness with its involvement to the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) – a joint initiative with DG CONNECT and the Member States and which will be running throughout October - advocating cybersecurity education, and the upcoming Annual Privacy Forum.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0613	2015-09-14	PR	Software bugs and hardware failures disrupt telephony and internet access - ENISA Annual Incidents Report	 ENISA publishes its Annual Incidents report which gives the aggregated analysis of the security incidents causing severe outages in 2014. Incidents are reported on an annual basis, by the Telecom Regulators under Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC) to the Agency and the European Commission. The report provides an overview on an aggregated level of which services and network assets were impacted, and the root causes of the incidents. In 2014, 137 major incidents were reported, from 24 EU countries and 1 EFTA member and 4 countries reporting no significant incidents. Most incidents reported, involve fixed telephony. The most frequent causes for incidents are technical failures, affecting mainly switches and routers. In summary, key findings indicate: Fixed telephony is the most affected, nearly half of all reported incidents (47%). This is a change compared to previous      reporting years, when mobile internet and telephony were the most affected by incidents. Incidents  in mobile internet and telephony affect  most users accounting for 1.7 and 1.2 million users respectively per incident Impact on emergency calls: 29 % of the incidents  illustrate problems in reaching the 112 emergency services. System or technical failures cause most outages  accounting for 65% of all reported incidents, with software bugs and      hardware failures, being the most common causes affecting switches and  routers. Additionally human error  also ranks high, which calls for improved cooperation between providers,  construction workers and third party vendors of equipment and managed      services.* Faulty software changes and updates have most impact  in terms of user-hours lost (user connections and duration)   These patterns are particularly important for risk and vulnerability assessments. Conclusions on the main patterns of incidents contribute at a policy level on the strategic measures to improve the security in the electronic communications sector. ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht commented: “All parts of society rely on public electronic communications networks and services. Being transparent and discussing the causes of incidents, is essential for risk management and improving the level of security. ENISA is dedicated to help increase resilience in the electronic communications sector and will continue to foster and support transparency on incident reporting, promoting a systematic approach towards improved security measures in the sector.” Within this context ENISA is assessing the impact of the Article 13a Incident Reporting Scheme in the EU, while a study is being carried out to analyse alternative indicators for measuring impact in electronic communications services. In addition, ENISA has issued the Guideline on Threats and Assets in the Telecom Sector, a glossary of the most significant threats and network assets, involved in disruptions in electronic communications networks and services.

For example, the Agency’s recommendations on incident reporting help Member States and the private sector to enhance baseline security measures through a better understanding of the root causes and potential solutions. Similarly on the eIDAS regulation, the Agency supports and provides guidelines for trust service providers on risk assessment and recommendations for incident risk mitigation, and provides guidelines on an auditing framework for trust services. Other activities in this area include analysis of relevance and compliance of standards related to TSPs; Incident reporting for Trust Service Providers; and a Strategy analysis for introduction of qualified website authentication certificates (QWACs) promoting consumer confidence in the web authentication market. ENISA also supports the creation of a Trust Services Forum explaining to stakeholders the developments in the area of eIDAS, while offering the opportunity to discuss with regulators on important areas. ENISA works closely with MS and the EU Institutions and the results produced rely on the collaboration with all NIS stakeholders. ‘ENISA is in the unique position to transfer the lessons learned across different operational communities, while promoting approaches to NIS that support economic growth’ said Udo Helmbrecht.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0621	2015-07-28	PR	ENISA publishes its Annual Report for 2014	" ENISA releases its Annual Activity Report for 2014. The report provides an insight into ENISA’s operations and key programmes in the service of the EU’s cyber security. Throughout this past year, the Agency has built on its renewed regulatory framework actively supporting: EU policy building and implementation of EU legislation: ENISA’s work in the context of Article 13a with National Telecom Regulators and European Electronic Communications Service providers has provided deep insights on root causes of major incidents and best practices. All Member States use ENISA’s technical guidelines in their annual reporting. On standardisation ENISA contributes at the CEN CENELEC ETSI Cyber Security Coordination Group (CSCG) with the development of the CSCG white paper. On Network and Information Security (NIS) the Agency has become a point of reference for European Trust Service Providers (TSPs) on eIDAS security requirements, and the data protection legislation with the reference document on privacy by design. The Agency also supports the EU’s cloud computing strategy and partnership through its work on governmental clouds, and developing best practice in the public and private sector and in particular for SMEs. Capacity building of EU Member States within the public and private sector, and raising the level of awareness among EU citizens. The ECSM (European Cyber Security Month) is a known example which takes place across 30 countries; with more than 184 activities and over 2000 twitter followers last year. Flagship programmes and achievements in 2014 include: The threat landscape report, which consolidates and analyses the top cyber threats and their evolution, referencing over 400 sources on threats, to help navigate through the cyber landscape. The report has received around 25000 downloads and is widely referenced. In parallel, two thematic landscapes have been developed by the Agency on Internet Infrastructures and Smart Home Environments. The Cyber Exercises, define and test operational procedures (EU-SOPs) for all cybersecurity authorities in the EU, for handling cyber events. A new incarnation of ""Cyber Europe 2014"" took place in 2014, where 1556 players representing 483 public and private sector organisations from 29 EU and EFTA Member States, tested collaboration simulating large scale cyber incidents. CERTs - the  EU’s Computer Emergency Response Teams – which assist public and private sector organizations, to provide a response to incidents and threats across an EU wide network through the exchange of experience and expertise while developing ‘baseline capabilities’. ENISA has developed, together with the CERT community, the training program for advanced skills for IT Security experts which is publically available on the ENISA website. Commissioner Günther H. Oettinger said: “2014 has been another very successful year for ENISA. It has been a year in which the Agency has further strengthened relations and outreach with stakeholders, both in the public and private domain. ENISA is providing solutions and expertise, and assistance for significant improvements to the state of cyber security throughout the EU. It is important to ensure a high common level of network and information security in the in the EU. ENISA’s role is decisive in this effort to establish a common approach and understanding in the community, to develop cyber security capabilities in the Member States, and to promote a truly EU digital single market for the benefit of citizens, governments and industry”. ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht stated: “Emerging trends in cyber security in this past year marked the different aspects to cyber security and cyber-attacks. We face a new type of asymmetric warfare with a new paradigm and no taxonomy. Furthermore, the development of digital solutions, result to a more data driven approach, increasing vulnerability to cyberattacks. Applications of new technologies also highlight unchartered territories and whether society can tolerate the consequences resulting from their use. ENISA will continue to deliver its programme to reinforce and promote trust and security in digital services in the EU”. In 2014 ENISA produced 37 reports in a variety of areas ranging from national level subjects such as the protection of critical infrastructure, to subjects affecting the individual citizen level such as privacy and data protection. ENISA’s 2014 reports are available online here.

ENISA_NEWS_0622	2015-07-21	NEWS	ENISA accredited as TF-CSIRT Liaison Member	 ENISA has been recognised as a 'liaison member' of the Computer Security Incident Response Team task force (TF-CSIRT), in July 2015. ENISA’s CERT- related deliverables have been either developed or validated in collaboration with the CERT (Computer Emergency Response Teams) community. TF-CSIRT’s training program is partly based on ENISA material, and the Agency regularly sponsors and contributes to these trainings. In addition, the Agency’s workshops and trainings for CSIRTs are often held back-to-back with TF-CSIRT meetings. ENISA’s Executive Director said: “TF-CSIRT is a very important community for ENISA, and this recognition hails 10 years of close collaboration. ENISA is honoured to be awarded this status, and is looking forward to contributing further to the CERT community”.  “Liaison members” are organisations that are not CSIRTs, but which the community trusts and deems important.  Several ENISA staff members are already part of the community as ‘Individual Members’ contributing through their skills and experience, and are regularly invited to TF-CSIRT meetings. Background: TF-CSIRT was created in Europe in 2000. It's a forum for CSIRTs to exchange experiences, forge relationships and to allow efficient handling of cross-border information security incidents. CSIRTs have extended their capacities throughout the years from a “reaction force” to complete security service providers, including proactive services such as alerts, security advisories, training and security management services.   For more information on ENISA's CERT activities visit the dedicated section.       Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0623	2015-07-20	NEWS	Key findings from the ENISA Workshop: Protection of Electronic Communications Infrastructure and Information Sharing	 ENISA’s Workshop on the Protection of Electronic Communications Infrastructure and Information Sharing successfully concluded with the participation of more than forty-five (45) participants from twenty (20) Member States. Representatives included Ministries and National Regulatory Agencies, Electronic communication providers and infrastructure owners. The workshop, which took place on June 16th 2015 in Romania, was an opportunity for participants to exchange views and best practices in the field. Key conclusions are: Information exchange tools enhance the security against incidents. Their usage can be voluntary or mandatory, depending on the cultural aspects of the country. Multi-stakeholder collaboration should take place at all stages of the design and the deployment of these tools. This will help to design the functionalities and facilitate the adoption of these tools, while it is necessary to take into account users’ needs. The development of these tools is a continuous process. Current tools need to evolve and new tools should be conceived keeping in mind the future outlook. Current trends include the adoption of new technologies (e.g. mobile usage), automation and integration with third-party systems through APIs.   During the workshop presentations of several tools was made by Ledningskollen (Sweden), KLIC (The Netherlands) and DIO (Sweden), while two panels - of managers and users - explored these tools. Workshop minutes and presentations are available online. Background information: Information sharing is very important in the prevention of future incidents that can impact network and information security. Internet outages, caused by the disruption of underground assets (such as cables, fibre optics, ducts), can be prevented by declaring these assets and future civil works in special tools. ENISA has analysed the solutions deployed in several EU Member States in the Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure  report. Moreover, specific tools such as DIO allow operators to share information about disruptions and share this information in a standardised manner.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0624	2015-07-16	NEWS	Are smart infrastructures and cyber security different worlds? 	" Udo Helmbrecht discusses the IoT at the 1st annual conference and launch event for the funding priority on “IT security for Critical Infrastructures” taking place on the 15th-17th July 2015, at the premises of the SGL Arena in Augsburg. The networking event includes representatives from the political, industry and scientific sector, taking a deeper look into critical infrastructures and IT security risks associated with new technologies and products, and the new business models. Udo Helmbrecht took part in panel discussion on the security of smart infrastructures, exchanging views on ""The look into the future"" and the Internet of Things (IoT) from smart homes to smart cities, as applications are allowing smart living in all aspects of daily lives: In smart homes we see media enabled devices that allow users to access data anywhere and anytime, making use of cloud services. Cyber physical devices allow the interaction of software controlled equipment to interact with the physical world. Smart cities create significant impact through smart transport and car-to-car communications; smart grids, that allow for lower energy consumption; and smart hospitals, providing better health services. All these rely on ICT services whose operation has to be secured against possible vulnerabilities which may result to economic and societal impacts depending on the case.   Prof. Helmbrecht said: “Currently there is no clear definition of cyber security for smart infrastructures at an EU level. It will be beneficial to increase information sharing and coordination for example on public transport. As new technologies and applications are developed, their security aspects also need to be developed from the design phase, allowing for improved services, user experience and safety in a connected online world”.   For details visit the event page.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0625	2015-07-08	NEWS	Key conclusions on the cloud landscape brought to the foreground at EU28 Cloud Security conference 	 The ‘EU28 Cloud Security Conference: Reaching the Cloud Era in the European Union’ brought to the foreground the current cloud landscape. The aim of the conference was to bring together practitioners, academics and policy makers to discuss the level of cloud computing security in the context of current and future policy activities. The conference included presentations and panel debates on legal and compliance issues, technical advancements, privacy and personal data protection, critical information infrastructures and cloud certification. During the conference the important role of cloud computing was acknowledged for the development of the digital economy in Europe. Cloud computing is becoming essential for users, including individual consumers, businesses and public sector organisations. However, recent figures indicate that users' concerns on cloud security are still the main barrier to the adoption of cloud services in Europe. Key conclusions highlight that: There is a need to raise awareness and educate users and SMEs on cloud security, to encourage safe and responsible use of cloud services. “Informed customers” should be able to ask the right questions to providers and understand where their responsibilities lay, and SMEs understand that they are co-responsible for the security of the cloud services provided. A risk assessment culture should be nourished applicable to all. Transparency of cloud services must be improved by the implementation of continuous monitoring mechanisms, increasing accountability through evidence-based assurance solutions, and certification, keeping in mind that one size does not fit all. Rapid, context-based information sharing of incidents within the industry sectors, will also enable collaborative information security able to respond quickly to the changing cybersecurity landscape. There is a need for flexible policy approaches towards cloud security to allow further technological advancements. Within this framework co-regulatory and self-regulatory initiatives should be supported, and create technology-neutral legal guidelines and obligations based on principles, to allow for flexible solutions. Europe-wide solutions should be encouraged Data protection is an important element to be considered. Implementation of existing rules and techniques should be encouraged and this information should be shared. Governmental clouds bring benefits to cloud security. There is space to strengthen cooperation and define clear procurement guidelines built on cooperation between industry and public sector. Furthermore, customised solutions based on the needs of each country and sharing of best practices can be encouraged. Cloud benefits from an open market. Meanwhile discussions are required on security in relation to data location requirements, foreign jurisdiction and access to European data. As cloud usage for critical sectors is increasing there is a need for elaborated security measures and specific risk assessment techniques addressing each critical sector’s needs.   Furthermore, cloud security was discussed in relation to the recent regulatory and policy initiatives, such as the ongoing data protection reform, the proposal for a Network and Information Security directive, cloud computing communication and the Digital Single Market strategy. There was consensus that further policy actions on cloud security could support trust and confidence in cloud services by addressing the key findings and issues deriving from the conference. The findings of the EU28 Cloud Security Conference were discussed and presented to the wider audience of the Digital Assembly European Commission high-level event taking place in Riga on the 17th and 18th June, 2015. The conclusions drawn were presented by ENISA’s Head of Critical infrastructures and Services Unit, Dr. Ouzounis, during workshop 1: “Building Trust and Confidence online”.   Background: The joint conference ‘EU28 Cloud Security Conference: Reaching the Cloud Era in the European Union’ was organised by the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Latvia and the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), which took place on June 16th, 2015 in Riga.   For press enquiries please contact press@enisa.europa.eu , Tel. +30 2814 409 576           Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0626	2015-07-03	NEWS	Udo Helmbrecht at the Chatham House on standardising European cyber security 	 ENISA’s Executive Director participated at the Chatham House Cyber 2015 meeting on 'Security, Privacy and Competing interests', on the 2nd and 3rd July 2015, in London. Udo Helmbrecht gave an overview on the standards landscape and its limitations. Prof. Helmbrecht said: “A plethora of fora and initiatives are available which lack though a consistent strategy, at a policy and the EU funded R&D program level. It is important to develop a consistent EU framework to cybersecurity standardisation. The challenge is to maintain security standards and develop a common understanding.” ENISA’s work in the field involves the Cybersecurity Coordination Group (CSCG) which aims towards: - An EU Governance framework, for a coordinated approach to cybersecurity standardisation and the identification of strategic options for EU-US standardization, addressing the particularities of cybersecurity. Furthermore, it aims to review and promote good practices. - Defining cybersecurity to ensure a common understanding and terminology, procedures, and identify gaps and overlaps in standardisation efforts  - The organization of an EU global initiative  on cyber security standards, for the exchange of views through a high level event.   Background: Increasing international tensions have raised cyber security risks. Governments and businesses appear increasingly in conflict over privacy and the internet governance debate has highlighted radically different national approaches to cyberspace. The conference explores the evolving relationship between cyber security, online privacy and the governance of cyberspace, and consider what policy architecture and technical capabilities are required to address critical risks and reduce international tension (source: Chatham House).    Check out also: ENISA paper on digital security published by European Standardisation bodies ENISA report on Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0627	2015-07-02	NEWS	ENISA’s Udo Helmbrecht at EPP Hearing on cybersecurity 	 ENISA’s Udo Helmbrecht participated at the EPP Hearing on data driven security, which took place today 1st July 2015, at the European Parliament in Brussels. Topics discussed included: Session I: New trends in digital technology developments and cyber threats to security   Session II: Fighting crime: use of new technologies and use of data Session III: Cyber Security: ensuring security and safety on state and individual levels The Executive Director participated (sessions I and III) providing insight into the trending developments and the major changes observed in cyber threats. It was noted that the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) doesn’t offer yet a commonly accepted security model, while new concepts may introduce new vulnerabilities into the core functionality of the internet. On the other hand, the development of digital solutions, whether in the area of smart homes and cities, mobile and wearable devices, smart infrastructure and big data, are affected by the need for increased efficiency, which results to a more data driven approach, increasing vulnerability (and interest) to cyberattacks. Furthermore, applications of new technologies highlight unchartered territories, and whether society can tolerate the consequences resulting from their use. Udo Helmbrecht looked into the impact of the trending cyber environment on personal and national security, and the antagonistic goals of these to privacy and data protection, as the line separating national security from commercial security is also increasingly blurred. Within this framework minimum standards and security by design were identified as key parameters of the development cycle. Furthermore, the Executive Director showcased the pan-European Cyber Exercises and the Agency’s contribution in facilitating cooperation between the different communities. Within this Udo Helmbrecht identified the need for: (1)    Understanding the risk: ENISA's threat landscape provides a comprehensive analysis (2)    EU Governance: There are dedicated agencies and established Governmental CERTs (Computer Emergency Response Teams) in the Member States and CERT EU. But, what is needed is a Member State and EU governance. Bearing this in mind, ENISA appreciates the NIS Directive approach (3)    Cooperation: between the private sector and the NGOs with initiatives such as, the (4)    European Cyber Security Month (ECSM): as an example of raising EU citizen’s awareness on cyber issues  (5)    IT security by design: developing secure devices and establishing IT security as a competitive advantage (6)    Building EU global champions: Europe has strong SMEs but when it comes to growth the limitations are 28 Member States, 19 Eurozone Member States, and 24 languages. “ENISA brings together the majority of the stakeholders in the EU to mitigate the risks associated with cyber security. Effective assessment of the threat landscape, policy development, cooperation and capacity building are necessary in order to effectively secure the critical sectors in society, ensuring the cyber frontier for citizens and Europe. To this end we need: (1) awareness, (2) EU cooperation, (3) standards, certification and audits, (4) supply chain integrity and liability, and (5) usage of cryptographic techniques” said Udo Helmbrecht.         Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0630	2015-06-16	PR	The EU28 Cloud Security Conference to take place in Riga	 On June 16, in Riga, the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Latvia and the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) will organise the EU28 Cloud Security Conference: Reaching the Cloud Era in the European Union. The participants of the conference will discuss the cloud security in the two parallel tracks: ‘Legal & Compliance’ and ‘Technologies and Solutions’. Discussing the ‘Legal & Compliance’ track, participants will address topics like cloud certification, cloud services procurement, security standards, data protection and trans-border data access, while talking about the ‘Technologies & Solutions’ track, participants will focus on encryption in clouds, big data, evolution of cloud computing, cloud forensics, research, development and innovation. Jānis Sārts, the State Secretary of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Latvia and professor Udo Helmbrecht, the Executive Director of the ENISA will open the conference. Keynote speeches will be given by the high-level representatives of the European Commission, industry and academia. “Nowadays governments, businesses and private individuals increasingly recognize the benefits of cloud services, thus leading to increase in deployments and usage. The EU28 Cloud Security Conference will try to address the security challenges posed by cloud services, as well as to provide a realistic view on our preparedness,” says J.Sārts. “Cloud computing is becoming the backbone of the EU’s digital economy. It represents an opportunity which needs trusted and secure cyberspace. Cloud supporting critical infrastructures is a reality: every day more banks, hospitals, telecommunications are adopting to the cloud model. The cybersecurity aspects involved cannot be underestimated in the context of an effective Digital Single Market. We must act decisively by removing barriers to cloud adoption and implementation in the public, government and private sector. Our presence at this event is to support activities in this direction,” says professor U.Helmbrecht. The conference will gather the audience of 150 governmental and corporate decision-makers, representatives from the EU institutions and agencies, research and development managers, cyber security practitioners and researchers. The EU28 Cloud Security Conference will be live streamed in the home page of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Latvia: http://www.mod.gov.lv. Cloud services are designed to provide easy, scalable access to applications, resources and services, and are fully managed by a cloud services provider. They can dynamically scale to meet the needs of its users, and since the service provider supplies the hardware and software, there is no need for a company to provide or deploy its own resources, or allocate IT staff to manage the service.  Examples of cloud services include online data. As cyber issues are taking an increasingly greater role in today’s security agenda, the Latvian Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2015 has set the Digital Europe as one of three policy priorities. Cyber security and defence form an inherent part of this priority. The findings of the event will be presented at the Digital Assembly that will take place on June 17-18 in Riga. The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) is a centre of expertise for cyber security in Europe. ENISA supports the EU and the Member States in enhancing and strengthening their capability and preparedness to prevent, detect and respond to network and information security problems and incidents. The programme and the list of confirmed speakers of the EU28 Cloud Security Conference: Reaching the Cloud Era in the European Union is available in the ENISA home page: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/enisa-events/cloud-security-conference-reaching-the-cloud-era-in-the-eu/cloud-security-conference-reaching-the-cloud-era-in-the-european-union.

ENISA_NEWS_0632	2015-06-15	NEWS	Call to participate in the EU28 Cloud Security Conference	   Prior registration in order to participate in the conference is mandatory. Please, register before June 11 in the home page of the European Commission. Discussing the ‘Legal & Compliance’ track, participants will address topics like cloud certification, cloud services procurement, security standards, data protection and trans-border data access, while talking about the ‘Technologies & Solutions’ track, participants will focus on encryption in clouds, big data, evolution of cloud computing, cloud forensics, research, development and innovation. Jānis Sārts, the State Secretary of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Latvia and professor Udo Helmbrecht, the Executive Director of the ENISA will open the conference. Keynote speeches will be given by the high-level representatives of the European Commission, industry and academia. The conference will gather the audience of 150 governmental and corporate decision-makers, representatives from the EU institutions and agencies, research and development managers, cyber security practitioners and researchers. The programme and the list of confirmed speakers of the EU28 Cloud Security Conference: Reaching the Cloud Era in the European Union is available in the ENISA home page. Cloud services are designed to provide easy, scalable access to applications, resources and services, and are fully managed by a cloud services provider. They can dynamically scale to meet the needs of its users, and since the service provider supplies the hardware and software, there is no need for a company to provide or deploy its own resources, or allocate IT staff to manage the service.  Examples of cloud services include online data. As cyber issues are taking an increasingly greater role in today’s security agenda, the Latvian Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2015 has set the Digital Europe as one of three policy priorities. Cyber security and defence form an inherent part of this priority. The findings of the event will be presented at the Digital Assembly that will take place on June 17-18 in Riga.

ENISA_NEWS_0633	2015-06-12	NEWS	The Netherlands - NCSC publishes factsheet 'Software has an expiry date'	" ""Software vendors regularly make announcements that certain versions of software will no longer be supported after a particular date. Such dates are known as End-of-Life. After the End-of-Life, software is no longer supported and can therefore not be considered to be secure. The NCSC advises to update systems after the announcement as soon as possible. Software that is still being used after its End-of-Life will become increasingly vulnerable to attacks. When an End-of-Life announcement is made, you should start with the upgrade process as soon as possible. Upgrading may lead to compatibility problems with other programs. Therefore you should start to plan, test and implement upgrades as soon as possible. Some systems, such as medical or industrial machinery, cannot be upgraded: alternative measures exist for these, but they require intensive administration.""

The event will also focus on the following areas: Making the EU an industrial leader in trustworthy ICT Building Capacity to fight cybercrime and strengthen cybersecurity in the EU and beyond Achievements of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy, the challenges and opportunities ahead   Udo Helmbrecht said: “The event is an excellent opportunity to discuss the challenges on cyber resilience, explore whether we are doing enough and how to bring forward the cooperation between the public and the private sector. An important aspect to look into is how we involve SMEs to become more effective in this area. For the EU to become the single market of choice for governments and industry, it is necessary to have trusted core NIS technologies and services for industry and citizens. The recently published DSM offers opportunities to businesses to make use of the benefits of the EU’s internal market. ENISA with its expertise is in the unique position to contribute and address the needs for high level online network security”.   Background: The event aims to provide an overview of the state of play of the implementation of the five main priorities of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy and showcase highlights of its main actions.

ENISA_NEWS_0636	2015-05-27	NEWS	Conclusion for the European Public-Private Partnership (PPP) for Resilience scheme	 This report analyses the opportunities and challenges of the first European public-private partnerships in the field of network and information security and resilience in Europe: the European Public-Private Partnership for Resilience (EP3R), in which mainly participated stakeholders belonging to the Telecom and Information Technology sectors. The report aims to define: The affinity of respondents with security and resilience issues and their impact The outcomes of PPPs in the Telecom and Information Technology sectors in comparison with those focused on other sectors (e.g. transport, energy, health, finance) The needs for a public-private partnership to improve network and information security and resilience at a pan-European level Other network and information security and resilience initiatives in the area of CIIs (different from the EP3R) Security and resilience issues related to CIIs as strategic assets of the European economy   The results confirm that the PPP approach is not equally distributed both in considered sectors and in the Member States. Among the advantages is the opportunity to exchange information, knowledge, expertise and good practices (25%), the opportunity to influence the decision making process (16,10%) and effective networking opportunities (17,90%). Factors impeding participation in these cooperation initiatives is because it’s uncommon in their sector of activity (35, 7%) or because these initiatives are not used in the countries in which the organisation operates (20%). The EP3R participants initiated many discussions, saw a lot of commitment, and produced interesting conclusions. The scheme proved appropriate for addressing complex cooperation problems within multi-stakeholder scenarios and cooperation issues in security and resilience. It also revealed some further needs in security and resilience, and the gaps to be filled in order to reach a higher maturity level of the Telecom Sector. Key recommendations for the future include four main points: Implement agile PPPs which can adapt to new needs and topics; Incentivise Industry initiatives; Define simple but formal rules and governance; Publish and advertise successful results   The EP3R (European Public-Private Partnership for Resilience) was established in 2009 and was the very first attempt at Pan-European level to use a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) to address cross-border Security and Resilience concerns in the Telecom Sector. In 2011 ENISA published a Good Practice Guide on Cooperative Models for Effective PPPs and implemented the suggested features in the EP3R for the second half of its existence.

This technique has been in use for several decades and it is the method most commonly used to get access to an account. The user often chooses simple passwords that are easy to remember. This makes it easier for malicious parties to gain access to accounts. When a malicious party gains access to an account, he can pretend to be the true owner of the account and misuse it.The NCSC advises users to make use of two-factor authentication whenever possible. It also recommends the use of strong passwords, and to consider using a password manager.

ENISA_PR_0646	2015-05-13	PR	ENISA welcomes the Commission initiatives on the Digital Single Market for Europe	 ENISA welcomes the Commission initiatives on the Digital Single Market (DSM) for Europe as published on Wednesday 6th May, 2015. ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht said: “Today marks an opportunity for Europe, its citizens and enterprises. The delivery of the DSM is a chance to reinforce citizens’ digital skills and trust for online services and the development of the EU’s industry - especially of SMEs - helping them make use of the benefits of the internal market”. ENISA sees cyber security as a key element for our digital future. The protection of information, information systems and infrastructure from those threats associated with the use of ICT systems in a globally connected environment and which constitute the backbone of the modern society and economy, is inevitably linked with effective security policies and robust and resilient cyber defence capabilities. “An open, safe and secure cyberspace is key for the security aspects of these technologies and the underlying infrastructures, and cannot be underestimated in the context of an effective DSM” said Udo Helmbrecht. The DSM is built on three pillars: (1) better access for consumers and businesses to digital goods and services across Europe; (2) creating the right conditions and a level playing field for digital networks and innovative services to flourish; (3) maximising the growth potential of the digital economy.  Pillars two (2) and three (3) of the Digital Single Market (DSM) fall within the scope of ENISA. Pillar 2: ENISA has been contributing to building reliable, trustworthy networks and services that safeguard consumers' fundamental rights to privacy and personal data protection that are a bedrock for DSM.

The creation of this Forum has been motivated by the need for open discussion after the entry into force of the Regulation 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. The Regulation has introduced new provisions that will facilitate harmonization and EU wide recognition of trust service providers, ensuring homogenous security levels and increasing market transparency. The eIDAS Regulation also foresees a permanent supervision of qualified providers, as well as periodical audits by conformity assessment bodies. The aim is for providers to be able to discuss with regulatory and supervisory authorities how to facilitate compliance by aligning regulatory developments with the current market good practices, and how to increase market penetration of qualified trust services, as it is key to ensure a viable business model for qualified trust service providers, through an increased use of these services among European citizens, businesses and public administrations.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0658	2015-04-10	PR	ENISA’s security guide and online tool for SMEs when going Cloud	 ENISA publishes a security guide and an online tool for Cloud security for SMEs to help them assess the risks and opportunities when deploying Cloud services. The security guide on SMEs The guide highlights the most important eleven (11) security risks and eleven (11) security opportunities for SMEs to take into account when procuring a cloud service. A selection of twelve (12) targeted security questions linked to the security risks and opportunities are presented as a ‘procurement cheat sheet’ to provide  SMEs with a clear view of the cloud service they procure. These features are enhanced by two exemplary cases of the use of cloud services by SMEs: as a customer and as a vendor offering services. The report indicates the challenges and opportunities in each case, and the security questions the SMEs should address to the provider in order to have a clear understanding of the current security state. The SME security tool The SME security tool is an implementation support for the security guide: using the tool, SMEs can rate the risks and opportunities according to their requirements and generate a customised list of security questions which can be used during procurement to collect information on the security measures adopted. The tool helps calculate and visualize risks and opportunities. The results of the tool are personalized to each SME according to its characteristics and the options selected in the tool. This tool is powered by ENISA to support the SMEs taking an informative decision in procuring cloud services. The Executive Director of ENISA, Udo Helmbrecht commented on the report: “Cloud computing has now become the backbone of the EU’s digital economy. With this tool ENISA aims to help SMEs benefit, as customers, from the adoption of cloud services in a cost-effective way while at the same time make use of increased security features, minimising exposure to threats.” The Security Guide for SMEs has been created in close collaboration with the ENISA Cloud Security and Resilience expert group and follows the ENISA Cloud Computing Risk Assessment for SMEs and the ENISA Assurance Framework. The risks and opportunities have been extensively cross checked and reviewed by subject matter experts.

ENISA_PR_0659	2015-04-09	PR	Joint supervision tool for telecom security 	 ENISA provides a single framework addressing the security measures covering technical and organizational measures applicable by the EU's regulatory framework for electronic communications, namely Article 13a of the Telecom Framework Directive and Article 4 of the ePrivacy Directive. The legislation requires Member States to ensure that telecom providers protect the security of their networks and services (Article 13a and Article 4), and the security of personal data processing (Article 4).  The joint framework is intended as a tool for authorities supervising the electronic communications sector in accordance with Article 13a and Article 4.  The benefits from the development of this single framework are two-fold: for telecom providers: simplifies compliance for authorities (telecom regulators, data protection authorities): enables consistent supervision and facilitates collaboration between authorities, nationally and cross-border. The framework contains 26 high-level security objectives, grouped in 7 domains. Each security objective is marked to indicate relevance for Article 13a and/or Article 4. For every security objective detailed security measures are listed as well as evidence that measures are applied. To highlight the fact that one size does not fit all, measures are grouped in 3 sophistication levels: basic, industry-standard, state-of-the-art. Staffan Lindmark, Deputy Head of Section at the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority and member of ENISA's expert group of Telecom Regulators, said on the initiative: “Access to dependable electronic communications is vital in today's society. Together, Article 13a and Article 4 form a comprehensive network and information security regulation for the telecom sector, which aims to ensure that users are provided with services that are reliable, and that the vast amount of data that is being transferred across the communications networks every day, is sufficiently protected. The joint framework developed by ENISA enables competent authorities to apply these rules in a consistent way across Europe.” ENISA’s Executive Director, Udo Helmbrecht commented on the project: “Security is a complex topic with a top priority for the EU. We have to avoid overlaps and inconsistencies between different laws. Experts from national authorities highlight there is roughly an 80 % overlap in the security measures that the telecom providers need to take to protect the security of networks and services, and the processing of personal data. ENISA acts as a liaison among the telecom regulators, the data protection authorities and the providers with the goal to assist Member States in implementing the legislation effectively and cost-efficiently.” The framework was developed with input from a group of experts from competent national authorities (NRAs and DPAs), based on earlier experience and discussions about how to supervise Article 13a and Article 4. The report follows the ENISA Article 13a guideline on security measures and subsumes the technical and organisational measures addressed in the ENISA Recommendations for technical implementation of Article 4 (Section 5.2).  ENISA will continue its work together with the national authorities across the EU and provide support in the supervision of security measures in the telecom sector.

ENISA_NEWS_0661	2015-04-02	NEWS	Germany - Fed­er­al Gov­ern­ment ap­proves draft IT Se­cu­ri­ty Act 	 The Federal Government on 17 December 2014 approved draft legislation to improve the security of information technology systems, the IT Security Act, proposed by Federal Minister of the Interior Thomas de Maizière. This is one of the first concrete steps in implementing the Federal Government’s Digital Agenda. As stipulated in the Coalition Agreement, the draft legislation defines requirements for the IT security of critical infrastructures, that is, those systems that provide vital services, such as electricity. The new legislation would require operators of critical infrastructures to meet minimum standards for IT security and to report significant IT security incidents to the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), which will analyse the information it receives and make the results available to operators of critical infrastructures to help them improve their protection. To improve IT security on the Internet, the proposed legislation also contains stricter requirements for providers of telecommunications and telemedia services, which would have to offer state-of-the-art security. Telecommunications companies would also have to warn their customers when they notice that a customer’s connection is being misused, for example by a botnet. The draft legislation provides for a greater role for the BSI and recognizes its increased significance as central agency for IT security by expanding its advisory function. In order to make the security of IT products more transparent for customers, the BSI would be authorized to test the security of IT products and systems currently on the market and publish the results as needed. The new legislation would also expand the authority of the Federal Criminal Police Office to investigate computer-related crime, in particular hacker attacks on federal IT systems. According to the BSI’s 2014 report on the IT security situation in Germany, which Federal Minister de Maizière and BSI President Michael Hange also presented on 17 December, the IT security situation in Germany remains tense: Cyber attacks occur daily and are increasingly professional and targeted. The report describes and analyses the current IT landscape, the causes of cyber attacks and the tools and methods used by attackers. The BSI report includes specific recommendations for improving IT security in Germany.

ENISA_PR_0662	2015-04-02	PR	ENISA’s How-to-Guide for Trust Service Providers’ Auditing	 ENISA has published a report providing guidelines on the auditing framework for Trust Service Providers (TSPs). These guidelines can be used by Trust Service Providers (preparing for audits) and Conformity Assessment Bodies (auditors) having to undergo regular auditing - as set by the eIDAS regulation - and offer a set of good practices which can be used at an organizational level. The report gives an overview of a typical three-stage audit methodology, listing all relevant requirements for the off-site (documentation level) and on-site (implementation level) assessment procedure, which is finalised with a conformity assessment report. The main areas discussed are: Obligations, warranties and liability of TSPs Standards applicable to TSPs and Conformity Assessment Bodies Methodology of auditing TSPs (off-site,on-site) TSPs documentation (plans, policies and procedures) Implementation of TSPs services   The Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht commented: “It is important to secure services with the appropriate means. Conformity assessment schemes ensure that the level of services corresponding both to the infrastructure (network and physical) and the human resources, meet security requirements, minimising exposure to risks and security incidents. ENISA’s recommendations provide a comprehensive reference document towards the implementation of trusted services”. Trust services must abide to certain criteria, namely legal requirements, standards (ETSI/CEN/ISO), terms and conditions and the state of the technology. Trust Service Providers (TSPs) are required to comply with these obligations within the framework of the eIDAS (electronic ID, Authentication and Signature) Regulation, adopted by the EU Parliament and the Council of the European Union, for electronic transactions in the internal market.   For full report: Auditing Framework for TSPs For interviews please contact press@enisa.europa.eu , Tel. +30 2814 409576 (att.

ENISA_NEWS_0664	2015-03-25	NEWS	ENISA publishes a good practice guide for CERTs' first responders 	 The guide aims to be a practical tool explaining the principles of sound evidence gathering and raising the right questions for collecting and securing digital evidence. The study complements the existing, vast, material on ‘digital forensics and evidence gathering’, which in most cases is written from the law enforcement perspective. For most CERTs this is a limited, and for many, a relatively new field of operation with a growing importance. Digital investigation and forensics are usually provided by CERTs as a service, on an ‘on-demand’ basis. A higher level of mutual understanding and collaboration between CERTs and law enforcement is considered to be the way forward to improve both the quality and the speed of results achieved in the fight against cybercrime. For the full report: Electronic evidence - a basic guide for First Responders Background: For the last three years, ENISA has engaged with the CERT and law enforcement communities to collect and share good practices, and useful fields of collaboration, in the area of fighting cybercrime, while also organising regular collaboration workshops. The report is a continuation of the work done by ENISA in the field of good practices for CERTs and LEAs in the fight against cybercrime. It follows the Baseline capabilities of non Governmental CERTs - Updated Recommendations 2012, the updated set of recommendations on baseline capabilities for non-Governmental CERTs in Europe, and the training material developed based on these principles, namely the Digital Forensics Training Handbook.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0665	2015-03-24	NEWS	The importance of standards in electronic identification and trust services providers	 A number of challenges are associated with the definition and deployment of standards in the area of cyber security. These include the lack of agility for standards to evolve at a comparable pace with the IT landscape, competing sets of standards, economic considerations (such as lock-in), lack of awareness, and organisational challenges. Currently in cyber security there is no single, consistent “line of standards”. Some areas are considered over-standardised while others lack compliance (i.e. within privacy and data protection legislation). Within the private sector, standardisation tends to be in line with the core interests of product developers or service providers. Aligning public sector goals with standardisation priorities of the private sector remains a challenge, with a number of EU governments promoting their broader adoption and use. ENISA’s report identifies alternatives and high level strategic options for recommendations on security standards. Additionally it explains the importance of taking advantage of EU funded R&D programmes (H2020) by launching flagship projects and initiatives with clear standardization objectives. The paper gives an inventory and overview of concrete standardisation activities associated with the electronic IDs trust service providers (eIDAS) regulation. It concludes with a proposal of a reviewed standard on cryptographic suites for electronic signatures and infrastructures. For the full report: Standardisation in the field of Electronic Identities and Trust Service Providers Background: Key EU initiatives within the area include the EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy providing a harmonised framework for the evolution of different aspects of cyber security, and includes a proposal for a Directive on Network and Information Security (NIS). Within this framework the Cyber Security Coordination Group establishes a European standardisation roadmap and acts as the main contact point for all questions by EU institutions, while it proposes to the Commission a cooperation strategy between the EU and the US.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0669	2015-03-16	PR	ENISA on EU cyber security at Parliament’s SEDE Committee	 ENISA’s Executive Director, Udo Helmbrecht, gave a speech today Monday 16th March 2015, at the SEDE (Security and Defence) subcommittee meeting in Brussels, in an exchange of views on cyber security and defence. Topics discussed involved: Assessing  efficiently the threat landscape  and understanding the cyber dynamics as an important tool towards an active and agile security management The  critical role of CERTs – the  EU’s Computer Emergency Response Teams – for developing ‘baseline capabilities’ and      providing an EU wide network responding to cyber incidents and threats The  development of pan-European cyber exercises and cooperation among Member States The  protection of Critical Information Infrastructure (CIIP) and the development of a common approach to incident reporting in Europe, bringing together National Regulatory and Data Protection Authorities The development of National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS) in the Member States The need for an EU legislation supporting privacy, by requiring systems’ developers and service providers to build in data protection measures from the design phase on (‘security by design’) The need for trusted core NIS technologies and services (an innovative business model for EU companies producing cyber security services and products) for the EU to become the single market of choice for governments and industry Challenges for the future illustrate that there are different aspects to cyber security and cyber-attacks. Firm action will be required, as a significant evolution in top threats is expected. To enable to address this, cooperation among Member States, EU Institutions, and other relevant bodies is a top priority. Furthermore, it is necessary to establish European prevention, detection and response capabilities and implement early warning systems. Udo Helmbrecht said: “The protection of information, information systems and infrastructure from those threats associated with the use of ICT systems in a globally connected environment is inevitably linked with effective security policies, and robust and resilient cyber defence capabilities, within a common EU policy. There are different aspects to cyber security and cyber-attacks. But all current security approaches tend to make use of the same technology, making it difficult to judge who is attacking what and why. Within this context, it should be examined what cyber security can offer at another level, contributing and protecting the EU citizens. Cyber security is the EU’s ‘digital frontier’”. Within this context, ENISA provided an overview of its active contribution at an EU level. The meeting was broadcast live and is available via the European Parliament multimedia library. Speech by Udo Helmbrecht at the SEDE Committee Udo Helmbrecht gave an Interview on the subject and is available online via the Europarl TV link. Background: “The EU Cyber Security Strategy was presented by the Commission and the HR/VP in 2013. It covers the internal market, justice and home affairs and foreign policy angles of cyberspace. In 2014 the Council adopted the EU Cyber Defence Policy Framework, focusing on CSDP, civil/military cooperation, training and international cooperation” source: SEDE About ENISA: The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) is a centre of expertise for cyber security in Europe.

ENISA_PR_0674	2015-02-26	PR	The steps for ‘Going Cloud’ for Governments and Public Administration	 ENISA’s Security Framework for Governmental Clouds details a step-by-step guide for the Member States (MS) for the procurement and secure use of Cloud services.This framework addresses the need for a common security framework when deploying Gov Clouds and builds on the conclusions of two previous ENISA studies. It is recommended to be part of the public administrations’ toolbox when planning migration to the Cloud, and when assessing the deployed security controls and procedures. The suggested framework is structured into four (4) phases, nine (9) security activities and fourteen (14) steps that details the set of actions Member States should follow to define and implement a secure Gov Cloud. In addition the model is empirically validated, through the analysis of four (4) Gov Cloud case studies - Estonia, Greece, Spain and UK – serving also as examples to Gov Cloud implementation. The framework focuses on the following activities: risk profiling, architectural model, security and privacy requirements, security controls, implementation, deployment, accreditation, log/ monitoring, audit, change management and exit management. The study shows that the level of adoption of Gov Cloud is still low or in a very early stage. Security and privacy issues are the main barriers and at the same time they become key factors to take into account when migrating to cloud services. Additionally, there is a clear need for Cloud pilots and prototypes to test the utility and effectiveness of the cloud business model for public administration.  Organisations are switching to Cloud computing, enhancing the effectiveness and efficiencies of ICT. For governments it is cost-efficient and offers important opportunities in terms of scalability, elasticity, performance, resilience and security. ENISA’s Executive Director commented: “The report provides governments with the necessary tools to successfully deploy Cloud services. Both citizens and businesses benefit from the EU digital single market accessing services across the EU. Cloud computing is a fundamental pillar and enabler for growth and development across the EU”. The report, is part of the agency’s contribution to the EU Cloud strategy, aimed at national experts, governmental bodies and public administration in the EU, for defining national Cloud security strategy, obtaining a baseline for analysing existing Gov Cloud deployment from the security perspectives, or to support them in filling in their procurement requirements in security. EU policymakers, EU private sector Cloud Service Providers (CSP), and Cloud brokers, can also benefit from the content. In essence the framework serves as a pre-procurement guide and can be used throughout the entire lifecycle of cloud adoption. The next step by ENISA is to offer this framework as a tool.

ENISA_PR_0675	2015-02-25	PR	Stronger together: ENISA concludes the Cyber Exercise 2014 today	 ENISA concluded today its three-phased pan-European cybersecurity exercise Cyber Europe 2014 (CE2014). The two-day event brought together, for the first time ever in Europe, over 50 senior representatives from 23 European Union and EFTA countries, ranging from cybersecurity experts to senior decision makers, to discuss a simulated crisis which started, almost a year ago, with the Technical Level Exercise in April 2014. The objective of the Strategic Level Exercise (SLEx) of CE2014 was to review the cyber crisis management mechanisms available at a national and European level and to discuss their limitations and possible future developments. In addition, the exercise addressed several key points, from crisis escalation to multinational cooperation and legal implications. ENISA assists the EU Member States, through the cyber exercise series, in enhancing their preparedness to tackle current and future cyber security challenges. Initial conclusions of the exercise indicate the emergence of a strong pan-European community of cyber crisis managers, evidence that the EU cyber security community is maturing. ENISA’s Executive Director stated: “The Cyber security exercise series illustrates that we are ‘stronger together’. Cyber Europe 2014 is a powerful instrument to analyse and improve critical cybersecurity issues at European level. Many lessons have been learnt and will be further analysed in the coming months”. ENISA is currently evaluating all the phases of the exercise and will present the lessons learned in May 2015. The next exercise, Cyber Europe 2016, will build upon the experience from Cyber Europe 2014 to continue improving cybersecurity in Europe. For interviews:Panagiotis Trimintzios, Expert in Network and Information Security, Razvan Gavrila, Expert in Network and Information Security, Adrien Ogee, Expert in Network and Information Security, e-mail: press[at]enisa.europa.eu Background information: ENISA, with the cooperation of EU and EFTA Member States, organises the Cyber Exercise series to prepare for major cybersecurity crises.

ENISA_PR_0676	2015-02-23	PR	How critical is a critical information infrastructure?	 This study provides state of the art methodologies, and suggests possible improvements that would allow Member States (MS) and operators of CIIs to protect themselves from future threats and challenges. Decision makers in MS, using ENISA’s methodologies, will be able to: define critical sectors and services supported by electronic communication networks identify CIIs assets and services supporting critical services, especially regarding internal and external interdependencies foster baseline security guidelines to ensure the resilience of critical networks assets and services closely cooperate with critical infrastructure assets owners and operators which should be involved in any related initiative in the security and resilience of these assets. Critical Information Infrastructure plays a vital role for the well-functioning of society and economy. A cyber-attack or an outage affecting these infrastructures could have cascading effects on large part of the population. Identifying these critical components is fundamental for ensuring their availability and avoiding repercussions on the life of European citizens. Currently a significant number of Member States lack a structured methodology regarding the identification of critical network assets. This can pose severe risks on the availability and resilience of the supported services. Moreover, based on the findings of the survey, the discussion with stakeholders and the analysis of the different approaches already in place, other challenges include: the lack of a detailed list of critical services which should be tailored per Member State criticality criteria for the identification of critical assets, which is a challenging process especially regarding internal and external interdependencies effective collaboration between public sector and the private sector is fundamental in identifying and protecting CII assets and services and should start from asset identification. ENISA’s Executive Director commented: “With the increasing reliance on communication networks, identifying Critical Information Infrastructures is the first step in protecting European networks. Effective collaboration between the public and private sector is fundamental in achieving this goal.” In 2015 ENISA will continue fostering security and resilience of the European networks. This year the focus will be on assessing critical communication networks, links and components. Furthermore the Agency will continue to promote the engagement of the network operations community, via the INFRASEC - Internet infrastructure security and resilience reference group, workshops and other awareness activities.    For full report: Methodologies for the identification of Critical Information Infrastructure assets and services For interviews: Rossella Mattioli, Security and Resilience of Communication Networks Officer, ENISA, Rossella.Mattioli@enisa.europa.eu,  Phone: (+30) 2814409628     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0677	2015-02-18	PR	ENISA’s recommendations for Certifying ICS/SCADA professionals	 ENISA’s publishes a new study - looking into the challenges and providing recommendations - for the development of schemes certifying the skills of cyber security experts working on industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) in Europe. An online survey and interviews with experts from EU Member States and worldwide, analyses how current initiatives on the certification of professional skills are related to the topic of ICS/SCADA cyber security. The convergence between Operations Technology (OT) for industrial processes and Information Technology (IT) raises the need for the security of ICS/SCADA systems but also for qualified professionals. Currently there is limited awareness of the available certification schemes in the sector which results in few qualified professionals. The complexity of ICS/SCADA systems lays mainly with its multi-disciplinary character (cyber security, operations and information technology) and the broad range of sectors using industrial systems (such as automation, energy, chemical, pharmaceutics, energy etc.). As such, ICS/SCADA systems display differences in their processes, operational procedures, and consequences. A main challenge of current certification schemes is managing the convergence of cyber security and operations technology. Another is the complexity of different and multi-levelled professional profiles and roles from a functional point. Furthermore, it is necessary to raise the relevance, credibility and strength of future certifications for ICS/SCADA cyber security, by obtaining the support of professional associations. The report proposes a series of recommendations to harmonize the certification of skills for ICS/SCADA professionals in Europe. These recommendations are relevant for both public and private sector across the EU: an independent steering committee should assess current global or national certification schemes and define a European Cyber Security certification scheme for ICS/SCADA professionals. This is important to achieve the degree of measured knowledge applicable to industrial operations. certifications should be multi-level to reach a wide range of professionals from different fields of practice, including operational and managerial topics, and practical aspects. a certification scheme should be established with management content. This would add value, ensuring that managers are qualified to make the right decisions in crisis situations. a simulation environment should be developed both for training purposes and for testing practical skills. ENISA’s Executive Director said: “ICS/SCADA cyber security is at the core of many industrial processes and a growing field which will present commercial and industrial opportunities. Specialised schemes certifying the skills of cyber security experts working on ICS/SCADA would be advantageous to industry sectors and sub-sectors, and important in ensuring the level of cyber security across Europe”.

ENISA_PR_0680	2015-02-09	PR	Are Smart Homes Cyber-Security smart?	 ENISA published the Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Smart Home and Converged Media today, a contribution towards the achievement of the EU Cyber Security Strategy objectives. The study aims to identify both the security risks and challenges as well as the countermeasures required for emerging technologies in smart homes, providing a specific and focused approach, with an overview of the current state of cyber security in this emerging domain. For the compilation of this report, an informal expert group was created to collect input at various stages of the project. In addition, the study takes into account existing assessments and publicly available information sources and provides a thematic Threat Landscape in the area of Smart Homes. Within the scope of the study, threat agents have been identified revealing several sources of vulnerability. Cyber criminals are identified as the largest and most hostile threat category, while the potential abuse of smart homes should be considered high with the increasing number of smart devices and homes and particularly converged media. Furthermore, several economic factors generate security vulnerabilities, while design choices are competing against cost and convenience. Many of the risks will be of a socio-technical type due to the depth and variety of personal information that can be captured and processed, and will produce data on previously unrecorded activities, with a close link between people and their environments. In addition, the interests of different asset owners in the smart home are not necessarily aligned and may even be in conflict, creating a complex environment for security activity. On the other hand, converged media and television raise security issues in terms of connectivity, embedded functionality, opaque systems and incompatibility with traditional information security approaches, along with issues of privacy, access and copyright. Converged media devices are likely to be some of the first consumer smart home devices introduced to many homes, and will therefore be the terrain for the initial playing out of many of the identified smart home security issues. Not all smart homes are created equally due to multiple design pathways which result in their own security and privacy peculiarities, sharing issues and vulnerabilities. Just as in many other areas of ICT, applying basic information security can significantly increase overall security in the smart home domain. Good practices in the sector involve the design of the smart home as a system, careful consideration of the security of cloud-based smart home designs, an application isolation framework (as developed in smart cars), and keeping critical software separate from non-critical apps, network and communications security measures. Similar approaches referred to for smart grids may prove to be applicable in the smart home context. The Executive Director, Udo Helmbrecht commented: “The smart home is a point of intense contact between networked information technology and physical space, and therefore brings together security risks from both the virtual and the physical contexts. Identifying cyber threats is crucial for the protection of the smart home and is therefore a key element in ensuring its successful deployment”.

ENISA_PR_0684	2015-01-29	PR	ENISA Cloud Certification Schemes Metaframework	 ENISA launches CCSM, the “Cloud Certification Schemes Metaframework”. CCSM is a metaframework, which maps detailed security requirements used in the public sector to describe security objectives in existing cloud certification schemes. The goal of CCSM is to provide more transparency about certification schemes and to help customers with procurement of cloud computing services. This first version of CCSM  is restricted to network and information security requirements. It is based on 29 documents with NIS requirements from 11 countries (United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Germany, Finland, Austria, Slovakia, Greece, Denmark). It covers  27 security objectives, and maps these to 5 cloud certification schemes. Since last year ENISA has been working, together with the Cloud Select Industry Group on Certification Schemes and the European Commission, and produced 2 tools to help customers with cloud security. This work is part of the EU Cloud Strategy. The first tool, CCSL, is a list of (existing) information security certification schemes. CCSL was launched last year and is accessible online . CCSM is the second tool, and extension of CCSL. CCSM is already being used:  the European Commission announced that they opened a large cloud services procurement tender (2500 cloud VMs and 2500 TB’s of cloud storage), which builds upon the 27 security objectives of CCSM.  Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director  of ENISA, said: “Cloud security is an important issue for both private and public sector customers in the EU. Obviously certification does not solve all the security issues, but it can simplify some of the procurement steps. This tool helps customers use existing certification schemes and it also offers cloud service providers a format for explaining security measures they take to protect their services.” This version of CCSM has been implemented as an online tool. The tool maps different certification schemes to a single list of security objectives. The tool allows customers to choose the security objectives most relevant to them, and generate a matrix mapping to different cloud certification schemes, and/or generate procurement checklists or questionaires as printouts or spreadsheets. Next steps for CCSM might be to include NIS requirements from other countries and to extend the scope of CCSM to include also NIS requirements specific for personal data protection.   For full report and online tool: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification Background: European Commission press release: EU tech companies invited to bid to provide Cloud services for the EU New Schemes on the Cloud Certification List (CCSL) : http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/new-schemes-on-the-cloud-certification-list-1 Certification in the EU Cloud Strategy: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification/certification-in-the-eu-cloud-strategy For interviews:  Dr. Marnix Dekker, NIS expert, and Dimitra Liveri, Security & Resilience of Communication Networks, at cloud.security@enisa.europa.eu     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0685	2015-01-27	PR	ENISA draws the Cyber Threat Landscape 2014: 15 top cyber threats, cyber threat agents, cyber-attack methods and threat trends for emerging technology areas	 ENISA’s Threat Landscape 2014 (ETL 2014) published today is the third yearly report in sequence, consolidating and analysing the top cyber threats and the evolution, encountered in 2014. ENISA Threat Landscape 2014, an activity contributing towards achieving the objectives formulated in the Cyber Security Strategy for the EU, stresses the importance of threat analysis and the identification of emerging trends in cyber security. Novelties of the 2014 ETL include: information on attack vectors, giving initial information on the “how” of a cyber- attack the elaboration of use-cases of threat intelligence, showing how threat analysis  can be used in phases of security management, and the involvement of stakeholders, consisting of 13 experts from CERTs, vendors, Member States and users. In 2014, major changes were observed in top threats: an increased complexity of attacks, successful attacks on vital security functions of the internet, but also successful internationally coordinated operations of law enforcement and security vendors. Many of the changes in cyber threats can be attributed exactly to this coordination and the mobilisation of the cyber community. However, the evidence indicates that the future cyber threat landscapes will maintain high dynamics. 2014 can be characterised as the year of data breach. The massive data breaches identified massive attacks to main security functions of the Internet, demonstrating how effectively cyber threat agents abuse security weaknesses of businesses and governments. Main lessons learnt of the ETL highlight that “sloppiness” with regards to cyber security - is the number one reason for breaches accounting for 50% of the cases. Additionally, a positive development is reflected in the increase of both the quality and the quantity of the collected information, resulting in better threat assessment and more detailed material for end-users. In the ETL 2014, details of these developments are consolidated by means of top cyber threats and emerging threat trends in various technological and application areas with references to over 400 relevant sources on threats, to help decision makers, security experts and interested individuals navigate through the cyber threat landscape. The Emerging Technology that will impact the Threat landscape are: Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), Mobile and Cloud computing, Trust Infrastructure, Big Data, and Internet of Things. CPS - has an important impact within the protection of Critical Infrastructure Protection - represents a distinct opportunity creating competitive advantages for European industry and research. Udo Helmbrecht, ENISA’s Executive Director, commented on the project: “Identifying and understanding cyber threat dynamics evolves to a very important cyber security tool. The dynamics of the cyber threat landscape set the parameters for flexible, yet effective security protection regimes that are adapted to the real exposure. Understanding the dependencies among all components of the threat landscape is an important piece of knowledge and an enabler towards active and agile security management practices. With ETL 2014, ENISA continues its contribution to publicly available cyber threat knowledge.” This year, ENISA has developed two thematic threat landscapes: one in the area of Internet Infrastructures and one for Smart Home Environments, to be published the following month. Individual, thematic Threat Landscapes provide guidance for the development of protection measures to minimize threat exposure of valuable assets in various sectors.

ENISA_NEWS_0686	2015-01-21	NEWS	ENISA at Omnicard	 The discussion will be centered on eIDAS as well as ENISA’s contribution to the e-Das directive, the proposed data protection regulation, Smart Grids, and TTIP. Special focus will also be placed on eID infrastructure and services including authentication methods in e-Finance and e-Payment services. On Thursday the 22nd January, ENISA’s Head of Secure Infrastructure and Services Unit, Dr. Ouzounis, will be presenting at the Main Forum on “Smart Homes” on the latest research and the wider EU policy environment in the field. In particular, an overview will be provided on the cyber threats related with the Smart Home, giving the scope on security challenges, risks and countermeasures required. Within this framework, existing good practice is explained, while the next steps in the sector are identified. As design and economic factors highlight the resulting gaps and vulnerabilities, the key issue that remains is securing communications and Smart Infrastructures (smart grids, smart cities, smart health). ENISA’s work featuring at Omnicard ENISA’s work, 'Framework on how to evaluate National Cyber Security strategies', is featuring at the Omnicard website. The report is addressed to policy experts and government officials who design, implement and evaluate an NCSS policy. This work is strongly aligned with the EU Cyber Security Strategy (EU CSS) and aims to assist Member States in developing capabilities in the area of NCSS. The framework developed is a flexible and pragmatic approach based on good practices shared by leading experts on NCSS, taken from eighteen EU National Cyber Security Strategies and eight non-EU strategies. It can easily be adjusted to the needs of different Member States depending on the level of maturity reached in the lifecycle of a NCSS. It proposes a step wise approach and introduces a set of practical key performance indicators (KPIs). It also issues recommendations that would allow proper implementation.

ENISA_PR_0687	2015-01-19	PR	New Guide by ENISA: Actionable Information for Security Incident Response	 ENISA publishes a good practice guide on Actionable Information for Security Incident Response, aiming to provide a picture of the challenges national CERTs and other security organizations encounter as they try to generate actionable output from large amounts of data. The study gives a broad overview of the current information-sharing landscape in the context of generating actionable information, identifies existing tools and standards, reports best practices and gaps, and provides recommendations for improvement. The main part of the report, describes how actionable information is obtained, utilized, and shared in a systematic manner. The conceptual model proposed which forms the structure for the study, introduces a generalized information processing pipeline with five steps: collection, preparation, storage, analysis and distribution. The purpose of the model is to facilitate the way CERTs deal with information, with the goal of streamlining the incident handling process. ENISA’s Executive Director Udo Helmbrecht commented: “CERTs are the first line of our cyber-defence. As their daily work relies on processing increasing amounts of data, the challenge is to make sense out of it and generate actionable output. Actionable Information is identified as a fundamental building block for incident response. This study is the first attempt to provide a reference guide on the topic for CERTs. ENISA welcomes the opportunity to support further work in the field, with reporting, research and further development of tools”. The gaps commonly found in CERT processes for handling actionable information are explored, and a set of general recommendations is provided for organizations with information-dissemination responsibilities. Overall conclusion is that information exchanges have not yet reached maturity and the sharing environment will need to develop further before the benefits of these exchanges is fully realised. The work includes three case studies covering various aspects of actionable information handling by CERTs. These scenarios capture the operational processes of real CERT teams and the actual features of the tools used, indicating how they can be applied to improve CERT team’s ability to produce, share and use actionable information. Inventory for information sharing The study is complemented by an inventory entitled Standards and tools for exchange and processing of actionable information that can be applied to information-sharing activities. It explores the relationships among the different standards by providing a better understanding of the underlying protocols. In the first part, the inventory covers a total of fifty-three different information sharing standards, a mix of formats, protocols, technical approaches and frameworks in common use. These are broken down into seven main categories based on the scope of the standard. In the second part, the inventory consists of sixteen information sharing tools and platforms relevant to the exchange and processing of actionable information. These are primarily open source solutions that are available to CERTs. A Hands-on exercise: Using indicators to enhance defence capabilities-Actionable information As part of the project a new hands-on exercise scenario was created as training for Incident Response Team members and other IT security professionals responsible for security incident response. The goal of this exercise is to teach how to create and deploy indicators of compromise using Collaborative Research into Threats (CRITs) platform. Additionally, it demonstrates how to leverage CRITs to visualize relationships among different elements of a campaign, how to extract indicators from incident data, develop mitigation actions, and track those actions. The exercise was created for a more structured approach to indicator management, ultimately resulting to be better equipped to secure networks.

ENISA_PR_0688	2015-01-15	PR	ENISA maps the Threat Landscape for Internet Infrastructure in 2014 and provides a Good Practice Guide for enhanced security	 The report details the assets composing an Internet infrastructure and classifies the threats applicable, highlighting “important specific threats” that disrupt connectivity. These include routing threats, DNS threats, and (Distributed) Denial of Service. Each threat is linked with a list of assets exposed. Overall, there is an increase in the occurrence of these threats. The report takes stock of publicly available security measures to protect Internet infrastructure assets and will enable asset owners to carefully analyse their Internet infrastructure through risk assessment and evaluation of exposure to specific threats. It details a list of good practices to make an Internet infrastructure more secure. Furthermore, a gap analysis outlines existing shortcomings of current good practices. From the analysis, the gaps are linked to the application of skill sets in all important specific threats analysed, as well as to system configuration and essential addressing protocols for (Distributed) Denial of Service. Five technical recommendations and four organisational recommendations respectively, are proposed for an enhanced level of security through the development and application of good practices, and the importance of collaboration in the community. Udo Helmbrecht , ENISA’s Executive Director, commented on the project: “Threats analysed in the current study indicate they are globally on the rise. It is important to apply good practices and promote the exchange of information, in order to mitigate threats and secure Internet infrastructure. ENISA’s Guide gives an up to date overview of emerging threats and lays the foundations for the community towards a more secure Internet infrastructure through proper risk assessment, training and evaluation”. The publication is part of the ENISA Threat Landscape 2014, an activity towards achieving the objectives formulated in the Cyber Security Strategy for the EU, which stresses the importance of threat analysis and emerging trends in cyber security.

ENISA_PR_0689	2015-01-15	PR	Securing the EU’s Finance Sector: Prospects and Priorities from the NIS perspective	 ENISA has published its latest research on Network and Information Security (NIS) for the EU’s Finance Sector, with information on the regulatory landscape and Industry priorities, at a strategic and governance level. The research aims at understanding and comparing the obligations relevant to Information Security within the finance sector in most of the EU28 Member States; to compare them with the Industry’s prospects; and to draw a clear vision of important priorities for the future. In addition, the study aims to understand the differences between the objectives of regulations and the priorities in the industry and reveals the different approaches in the EU28 Member States relating to NIS supervision. The work is based on a stock taking approach including: Identification of national NIS requirements; Interviews with national financial supervisory authorities, European authorities and Industry representatives. The report reveals several desirable objectives: the convergence of supervision practices on NIS matters, the need for clear definitions of guidelines for both compliance and good practices, the need to improve proactive cooperation on NIS challenges. The study shows that large international banking groups demonstrate a good understanding of the Risk Landscape and the available Security schemes. Many banks have introduced enhanced good practices especially in the area of IT governance, while medium-sized stakeholders demonstrate limited top management involvement and capacity to be certified against current international standards, and a de-prioritisation of security investments. Differences as such are to be expected. The aim is to understand where such prospects could actually impair financial resilience altogether. ENISA’s Executive Director, Udo Helmbrecht commented: “Securing cyberspace and e-communications has become both a governmental and an Industry priority worldwide. The growing relevance of information and communication technologies in the essential functions of the economy has reinforced the necessity of prevention and protection measures in all sectors, naturally including the finance sector. ENISA will continue to contribute in improving information security baselines and supporting cooperation initiatives in the finance sector through its expertise. By supporting the ECB and European Finance sector’s Authorities in organising stress tests, enabling secure usage of Cloud-based services and developing a guidebook on pan-European security measures”. The report is primarily intended for CISOs/CIOs/CTOs of the Finance sector, NIS Experts in National Financial Supervisory Authorities, NIS Experts in the ESFS (EBA, ESMA, EIOPA), and Professional Associations. A number of recommendations are proposed with regards to the future of NIS in the Finance sector, along with high-level background information related to the specifics of the European Finance System.

ENISA_NEWS_0691	2015-01-12	NEWS	Deciphering the landscape for Privacy by Design. ENISA publishes its recommendations for policy makers, data protection authorities and experts 	 ENISA publishes today, 12th January 2015, a cutting edge report on Privacy and Data Protection by Design - from policy to engineering. The report aims to bridge the gap between the legal framework and the available technological implementation measures. It provides an inventory of the existing approaches and privacy design strategies, and the technical building blocks of various degree of maturity from research and development. Limitations and inherent constraints are presented with recommendations for their mitigation. The study, targeted at data protection authorities, policy makers, regulaltors, engineers and researchers, offers an insight into the technological aspect of the current state of the art. It presents the challenges and limitations of by-design principles for privacy and data protection, acts as a reference guide, and intends to improve the effectiveness of future policy in the area. The main challenges identified in the report are two fold:   Existing policy doesn’t offer a guarantee for compliance with privacy by design. New policy should give incentives for adopting privacy by design. New standards for electronic communication need to consider privacy and data protection, while privacy and data protection-ignorant standards should be out-phased. Furthermore, privacy by design needs to be linked with the practice taking usability into account. For the full report: Privacy and Data Protection by Design - from policy to engineering Background: Privacy constitutes a core value of individuals and democratic societies. Decades of debate have gone into the manner of embedding these values and legal obligations into systems, preferably from the beginning of the design process. The term “Privacy by Design”, or “Data Protection by Design” refer exactly to this.  Although the concept has found its way into legislation, e.g., the proposed European General Data Protection Regulation, its concrete implementation remains presently unclear.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

Background: Worldwide, the cyber threat landscape – and threat analysis in general – has been assigned a central role in practical Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM). This is the case both in the relevant vendor market and within end-user organisations. A plethora of related services and good practices are available that are based on threat intelligence. They consist mainly of collection, aggregation and correlation of data. It has been recognised that information on cyber-threats should be the parameter to actively adapt security protection practices towards a more agile management of security controls.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0693	2014-12-19	PR	Smart grid security certification in Europe: Challenges and Recommendations	 ENISA issues today a report on Smart grid security certification in Europe targeted at EU Member States (MS), the Commission, certification bodies and the private sector; with information on several certification approaches across the EU and other MS and EFTA countries. It describes the specific European situation, and discusses the advantages and challenges towards a more harmonised certification practice. The report, aims to attract the interest of the smart grid experts and the support of certification authorities on open issues of security certification in smart grid environments. The increasing need for smart grid certification derives from the lack of control over the power supply chain (cables, solar panels, wind turbines, etc.), introduced by smart grid automation. Udo Helmbrecht commented on the project: ‘Smart grid and renewable energy are very promising for the European industry. Security certification is an important tool towards increasing users’ trust on the energy power supply chain. In this report, ENISA provides recommendations which support certification authorities in reflecting upon their national security requirements and at the same time pave the way towards improved harmonisation of European smart grid certification practices”. Within this framework, ENISA provides ten recommendations to Member States and the European Commission. These are: The European Commission should appoint an EU steering committee to coordinate smart grid certification activities The EU steering committee should provide guidance and a reference model to implement a chain of trust The EU steering committee should perform a mapping exercise amongst available standards and schemes used in the EU The EU steering committee should promote international recognition of schemes such as SOG-IS The EU steering committee should promote validation that is commensurate with the risk appetite involved in each use smart grid case The EU steering committee should facilitate flexibility to update protection profiles so they can cope with the fast moving security threat landscape The Member States should use national profiles as detailed specifications of international standards to cover the specific national use cases and nationally supported test and certification methods The European Commission should ask technical committees, in collaboration with the European energy associations, to create European profiles The EU steering committee should encourage the provision of tools in respect to the proposed certification framework, while the national technical committees should provide pre-assessment tools for specific schemes The European Commission and the Member States should promote compliance and harmonization as economic advantage and a cost reduction measure. The report, builds on the findings of the  security certification of smart grid components workshop in 2012, co-organised by DG-CNECT and ENISA in Brussels. The key message is that Europe needs more harmonised smart grid security certification practices, as a means to lower certification cost. Further, the report is the result of consultation with smart grid security certification experts, and has been validated by security experts, in a workshop held in Heidelberg in September 2014.

ENISA_NEWS_0694	2014-12-18	NEWS	New Schemes on the Cloud Certification List	 ENISA has been working throughout 2014 together with the European Commission and industry actors, on an action under the EU Cloud Strategy to make a list of voluntary certification schemes relevant for cloud computing. The cloud certification list, called CCSL, gives an overview of relevant certification schemes and provides answers to frequently asked questions like: What is the underlying standard?  How does a provider get certified? Who audits the security? How many providers are certified? CCSL was first launched in April with just five certification schemes. The last months ENISA worked with industry to add more schemes and to extend the information on the list. Now the list has 12 individual schemes, including some self-assessment schemes and some schemes commonly used overseas, like PCI DSS and AICPA SOC. Dan Cimpean (Deloitte), one of the experts in the C-SIG working group on certification, who analysed the SOC standards, explains: “Especially in Europe, cloud stakeholders are searching for a better balance between the compliance burden and the assurance level in the cloud eco-system. More and more cloud service providers consider a SOC 2 report to effectively respond to the expectations of cloud customers for better security”. Ralph Salomon, from SAP (a large European cloud provider), who analysed the PCI DSS standard, remarks: “SAP's intention is to provide full transparency on the security and compliance status of our cloud offerings to our customers. In Europe we don't need to re-invent certification standards as we can rely on relevant and internationally accepted standards and good practices. SAP very much appreciates and supports the CCSL initiative of European Commission and ENISA as it provides clarity to the customers on relevance and value of standards and good practices.” In the coming weeks ENISA will also publish a framework to map from customer requirements to the security objectives in existing certification schemes. The Cloud Certification Schemes Metaframework (CCSM) will be launched in January as a procurement tool for the public sector.

ENISA_PR_0696	2014-12-17	PR	Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure	 ENISA has released today a new report on the Protection of Underground Electronic Communications Infrastructure. This report – targeted at Member States (MS), public institutions, owners of underground communication assets, as well as excavators and civil workers – is the first to investigate the use of automated information systems for damage prevention against civil work, and provides recommendations to increase the resilience of electronic communication infrastructures. The report analyses the existing initiatives deployed by selected MS of the European Union – Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, and Sweden – who have developed specific tools in order to prevent the disruption of underground electronic communication infrastructure. Automated information systems are the most advanced tools against underground infrastructure damage, used by government institutions, municipalities, excavators and underground infrastructure owners. These act as a single point of contact to prevent outages. With regards to digging, it provides: To excavators the list of infrastructure owners with underground assets, and To the owners of underground infrastructure notifications of planned civil work. For the purpose of the study, a survey was performed to understand the development of existing tools in relation to technical and operational use, financing schemes, and the security measures adopted to guarantee the confidentiality of data exchanged. Further, the advantages of automated information exchange tools for the protection of underground infrastructure are presented. The principle results are summarized, providing options for improvement and an insight into future developments in the area. Udo Helmbrecht commented on the project: “The report highlights how automated information systems can actively participate to the protection of underground electronic communication infrastructure. Strong collaboration is needed among stakeholders for the protection of underground assets, while future improvements should ease the adoption of these tools”. The study follows ENISA’s latest Annual Incident reports, which reveals that cable cuts remain a major cause of connectivity outage. Cable cuts are mainly related to excavation performed during civil work, having an impact on electronic communications. The report highlights the benefits of the use of these tools in limiting Internet outages.

ENISA_PR_0699	2014-12-11	PR	Secure ICT Procurement for Secure Electronic Communications	 ENISA publishes two reports today. The “Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications” report which highlights the growing dependency of providers on ICT products and outsourced services, and analyses the associated security risks involved in the process. The “Security Guide for ICT Procurement” aims to be a practical tool for providers to better manage security risks when dealing with vendors and suppliers of ICT products and outsourced services. Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications The study, follows the last edition of the Annual Incidents report which gives an aggregated analysis of the security incidents resulting to severe outages, with a primary cause being third party ICT products and outsourced services especially in the area of hardware failures and software bugs. This year’s report is the result of ENISA’s collaboration with providers and vendors in an effort to address these issues. The key issues raised by electronic communication providers include: Lack of security controls on the vendor’s side Software vulnerabilities in ICT products or services Non-compliance with security requirements in contracts Lack of support from vendors in case of incidents Weak negotiation power for providers Lack of a framework or guidance for providers during procurement and outsourcing In this context ENISA provides general recommendations and includes the results of a survey it conducted across electronic communication providers and ICT vendors. Recommendations to Member States involve raising awareness on the security risks related to the procurement of ICT products and outsourcing services. In addition, vendors and providers are encouraged to develop a collaborative approach in setting security requirements, sharing information on security vulnerabilities and threats, and mitigating incidents. Security Guide for ICT Procurement The Guide maps security risks to the full framework of security requirements which can be used as a tool during procurement by vendors, and addresses security risks for core services in communication networks and services. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht commented: “Every year we see from the annual incident reporting that third-party ICT products and managed services are a major cause of outages. A simple software bug can have a severe impact on the availability of the internet and telephony services, and providers are not always able to fix such issues quickly on their own. The Security Guide for ICT Procurement we publish today is a practical tool to help providers buy ICT products and services from vendors and suppliers, with the necessary security requirements.” For full reports: Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic Communications & Security Guide for ICT Procurement Background: ENISA Annual Incident Reports For interviews; Christoffer Karsberg, Expert, resilience[at]enisa.europa.eu     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0704	2014-11-28	PR	ENISA publishes the first framework on how to evaluate National Cyber Security Strategies	 ENISA issues today an Evaluation Framework on National Cyber Security Strategies (NCSS) addressed to policy experts and government officials who design, implement and evaluate an NCSS policy. This work is strongly aligned with the EU Cyber Security Strategy (EU CSS) and aims to assist Member States in developing capabilities in the area of NCSS. The framework developed is a flexible and pragmatic approach based on good practices shared by leading experts on NCSS, taken from eighteen EU National Cyber Security Strategies and eight non-EU strategies. It can easily be adjusted to the needs of different Member States depending on the level of maturity reached in the lifecycle of a NCSS. The framework proposes a step wise approach and introduces a set of practical key performance indicators (KPIs). It also issues recommendations that would allow proper implementation of the framework. This report builds on ENISA’s previous work on NCSS. In 2012, ENISA introduced a good practice guide on how to implement a NCSS following a well-defined lifecycle. The guide included an analysis on how to involve the private sector in the process, how to align policy; operational and regulatory objectives, and how to develop capabilities on cyber security issues. Udo Helmbrecht commented on the project: “A National Cyber Security Strategy is an important step that allows Member States to address cyber security risks and challenges. This is a continuous process that requires proper evaluation, in order to adjust to the emerging needs of society, technology and the economy. With this work ENISA provides a systematic and practical evaluation framework that allows EU Member States to improve their capabilities when designing NCSS”.  The report was presented in Brussels on the 27th November 2014 at the first workshop on National Cyber Security Strategies organised by ENISA. Leading experts from EU Member States showcased their national cyber security action plans and participated in discussion panels on Critical Information Infrastructures, public private partnerships and national capabilities development. Within the workshop the importance of using a pragmatic evaluation framework was highlighted as an increasing need and priority. ENISA maintains an up to date list of EU and global NCSS by country on its web site. It allows interested public and private stakeholders to be updated on NCSS and download relevant material. The publication follows the NCSS report and the Good Practice Guide on NCSS in 2012.

ENISA_NEWS_0711	2014-11-27	NEWS	The Netherlands - Cyber Security Assessment published	 Cybercrime and digital espionage remain the biggest threat in the area of cyber security. The potential impact of cyber attacks and disruptions will only increase, due to rapid digitization. Another notable finding is the lack of so-called IT Durability. An example of this is the risk that an increasing number of devices is connected to the Internet, while these devices and their software are not maintained for extended periods of time by the suppliers. Also, privacy could be jeopardized by the technical ability to collect data.

ENISA_PR_0715	2014-11-21	PR	Securing Personal Data: ENISA guidelines on Cryptographic solutions	 ENISA is launching two reports today. The “Algorithms, key size and parameters” report of 2014 is a reference document providing a set of guidelines to decision makers, in particular specialists designing and implementing cryptographic solutions for personal data protection within commercial organisations or governmental services for citizens. The “Study on cryptographic protocols” provides an implementation perspective, covering guidelines regarding protocols required to protect commercial online communications containing personal data. “Algorithms, key size and parameters”  This report provides a set of proposals in an easy to use form, with a focus on commercial online services that collect, store and process the personal data of EU citizens. It provides an update of the 2013 cryptographic guidelines report on security measures required to protect personal data in online systems. Compared with the 2013 edition, the report has been extended to include a section on hardware and software side-channels, random number generation, and key life cycle management, while the part on protocols, for 2014 is extended and is a stand-alone study on cryptographic protocols. The report explains two aspects of cryptographic mechanisms: whether a given primitive or scheme can be considered for use today if it is already deployed whether a primitive or scheme is suitable for deployment in new or future systems.  Long term data retention issues are analysed along with a number of general issues related to the deployment of cryptographic primitives and schemes. All the mechanisms discussed in the report are standardised to some extent, and have either been deployed, or are planned to be deployed, in real systems. “Study on cryptographic protocols” The second report focuses on the current status in cryptographic protocols and encourages further research. A quick overview is presented on protocols which are used in relatively restricted application areas, such as wireless, mobile communications or banking (Bluetooth, WPA/WEP, UMTS/LTE, ZigBee, EMV) and specific environments focusing on Cloud computing. The main emphasis of the report is on guidelines to researchers and organisations in the field, which include: Cryptographic and security protocols to be designed by cryptographic protocol experts rather than networking and protocol experts to date. Additionally, researchers need to simplify the analysis and enable automated tools to provide strong computational guarantees. More attention is required to automated verification so the implementation of a protocol can meet given security goals, and examine how automated tools can guarantee correct implementation of a protocol design. Small insignificant changes in protocols can result in invalidating the guarantee proofs. Future protocols should be designed using solid and well-established engineering principles, ease of formal security analysis, and in conjunction with the development of formal security proofs, designed in cryptanalysis of their constituent primitives. Future protocols should not be any more complex than they need to be. More work needs to be performed on verifying APIs for application protocols.  Udo Helmbrecht said of the reports: “What is highlighted is the need for certification schemes in all phases of the technological life-cycle. ’Security by design or by default’ built in processes and products, are basic principles for trust. Standardising the process is an essential element in ensuring the correct application of the data protection reform in the service of EU’s citizens and its internal market. ENISA’s guidelines strive to provide the correct framework in securing online systems.” The EC Regulation 611/2013 references ENISA as a consultative body, in the process of establishing a list of appropriate cryptographic protective measures for personal data protection. ENISA’s cryptographic guidelines should serve as a reference document. Within this scope, the provided guiding principles are rather conservative based on current state-of-the-art research, addressing construction of new commercial systems with a long life cycle.

ENISA_PR_0723	2014-10-30	PR	Biggest ever cyber security exercise in Europe today	" In Cyber Europe 2014 experts from the public and private sectors including cyber security agencies, national Computer Emergency Response Teams, ministries, telecoms companies, energy companies, financial institutions and internet service providers are testing their procedures and capabilities against in a life-like, large-scale cyber-security scenario. #CyberEurope2014 is the largest and most complex such exercise organised in Europe. More than 2000 separate cyber-incidents will be dealt with, including denial of service attacks to online services, intelligence and media reports on cyber-attack operations, website defacements (attacks that change a website's appearance), ex-filtration of sensitive information, attacks on critical infrastructure such as energy or telecoms networks and the testing of EU cooperation and escalation procedures. This is a distributed exercise, involving several exercise centres across Europe, which is coordinated by a central exercise control centre. European Commission Vice-President @NeelieKroesEU said: ""The sophistication and volume of cyber-attacks are increasing every day. They cannot be countered if individual states work alone or just a handful of them act together. I'm pleased that EU and EFTA Member States are working with the EU institutions with ENISA bringing them together. Only this kind of common effort will help keep today’s economy and society protected."" The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, commented: “Five years ago there were no procedures to drive cooperation during a cyber-crisis between EU Member States. Today we have the procedures in place collectively to mitigate a cyber-crisis on European level. The outcome of today’s exercise will tell us where we stand and identify the next steps to take in order to keep improving.” The #CyberEurope2014 exercise will, among others, test procedures to share operational information on cyber-crisis in Europe; enhance national capabilities to tackle cyber crises; explore the effect of multiple and parallel information exchanges between private-public, private-private at national and international level. The exercise also tests out the EU-Standard Operational Procedures (EU-SOPs), a set of guidelines to share operational information on cyber crisis. Background According to ENISA’s Threat Landscape report (2013), threat agents have increased the sophistication of their attacks and their tools. It has become clear that maturity in cyber activities is not a matter of a handful of countries. Rather, multiple countries have developed capabilities that can be used to infiltrate all kinds of targets, governmental and private in order to achieve their objectives. In 2013, global web web-based attacks increased by almost a quarter and the total number of data breaches was 61% higher than 2012. Each of the eight top data breaches resulted in the loss of tens of millions of data records while 552 million identities were exposed. According to industry estimates cyber-crime and espionage accounted for between $300bn and $1tn in annual global losses in 2013. The exercise This exercise simulates large-scale crises related to critical information infrastructures. Experts from ENISA will issue a report with key findings after the exercise ends. #CyberEurope2014 is a bi-annual, large scale cyber security exercise. It is organised every two years by ENISA, and this year counts 29 European countries (26 EU and 3 from EFTA) plus EU Institutions. It takes place in 3 phases throughout the year: technical, which involves the incident detection, investigation, mitigation and information exchanges (completed in April); operational/tactical, dealing with alerting, crisis assessment, cooperation, coordination, tactical analysis, advice and information exchanges at operational level (today) and early 2015; strategic, which examines decision making, political impact and public affairs. This exercise will not affect critical information infrastructures, systems, or services. In the Cyber security Strategy for the EU and proposed Directive for a high common level of network and information security (NIS), the European Commission calls for the development of national contingency plans and regular exercises, testing large-scale networks’ security incident response and disaster recovery. ENISA’s new mandate also highlights the importance of cyber-security preparedness exercises in enhancing trust and confidence in online services across Europe. The draft EU-SOPs have been tested over the last three years, including during CE2012.

ENISA gave a sneak preview of several whitepapers which will be published this year: An ICT Buyer Vendor guide for telecom providers, an overview of national tools for the protection of underground cables, a methodology for the identification of critical information infrastructure assets, and a threat landscape for internet infrastructure. ENISA, together with experts in the group, using input from the sector, continues to improve and adjust the Article 13a technical guidelines. As part of this ongoing process, ENISA today publishes updates of the two main technical guidelines Version 2.1 of the Article 13a Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting includes a new threshold for EU-wide security incident reporting. The new threshold is an absolute threshold set at 1 Million user hours lost, which should be more appropriate for the larger EU countries. Version 2.0 of the Article 13a Technical Guideline on Security Measures includes for each high-level security objective a set of detailed security measures, grouped in 3 sophistication levels. The new guideline allows NRAs to supervise security in a diverse sector. Background information The Article 13a Expert Group was set up by ENISA, under the auspices of the European Commission, to agree on a harmonised implementation of Article 13a of the Telecom Framework Directive. The group discusses about how to implement security incident reporting (nationally and across the EU) and how to supervise security measures in the telecom sector. The group also exchanges lessons learned about major incidents affecting electronic communications networks and services. The work of the Article 13a Expert Group is explained in a short video.

ENISA_PR_0731	2014-10-01	PR	ENISA celebrates 10 years of supporting EU cyber security with a high-profile event on the Future of Cyber Security Challenges	" The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) today held its annual high-level event at the Representation of the Free State of Bavaria to the EU, in Brussels. This year’s theme “10 years of securing Europe’s cyber security... and beyond!” marks a decade of contribution by the Agency to improving EU cyber security and looks ahead at the future cyber security challenges. Topics included using cyber security as an economic enabler, how we can secure future technologies, the need to apply standardisation and how to effectively balance security needs with privacy. The meeting, led by ENISA’s Executive Director, Prof. Dr Udo Helmbrecht, brought together key members of the European Parliament and the European Commission with representatives of the private sector from Europe and the U.S. Mr Michael Hinterdobler, Head of the Bavarian Representation, gave the opening statement. The key note speech was delivered by Ms Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the European Commission and Commissioner for the Digital Agenda. Panellists and participants included Mr Christian Ehler (MEP, ITRE), Mr Paul Timmers (EU Commission), Mr Scott Charney (Microsoft), Dr Thomas Kremer (Dt. Telekom), Mr Reinhard Ploss (Infineon), Mr Marc Darmon (Thales), and Mr Matt Ellard (Symantec). The Executive Director Prof. Dr Udo Helmbrecht commented: “Cybersecurity is essential for the smooth operation of our society and economy. In this event, ENISA presents its concrete contribution to EU society and industry all these years, and together with all public and private actors looks into the future challenges of cyber security. ENISA, as a centre of expertise in cyber security for Europe, is uniquely positioned to address these challenges”. The event included the official launch of the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) with the support of DG CONNECT and Partners. Representatives included Code week, Safer Internet, the Grand Coalition for Jobs, European and US Partners, and ENISA Board member Mr Francois Thill from the Luxemburg ECSM coordination who moderated the discussion on the issue of “Involving the citizen”. Commissioner Kroes’ comment on the ECSM: “The Internet and its many services bring many benefits to our society: not least significant growth of our economy and millions of jobs. But we need to build and restore trust if we really want to achieve those benefits. When it comes to cyber security, it is in our common interest to be much more responsive and resilient to cyber threats. ENISA can both play an operational and a strategic role to ensure that Europe is ready for the challenge, together with public and private parties. Each one of us must play our part in the cyber-security challenge: every citizen, every business, every government."" Within the scope of the event, the vulnerability of IT systems and services was demonstrated with a live hacking showcase by Symantec. In addition, ENISA publishes today two reports: ENISA’s Cyber Cooperation report looks at a decade of achievement, summarising the threat landscape, the recent developments in EU policy and the regulatory framework. ENISA’s Digital Sovereignty report identifies the barriers for an alternative model for the EU cybersecurity industry.

ENISA_PR_0734	2014-09-29	PR	Countries aligned for the deployment of the European Cyber Security Month	" The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), the European Commission DG CONNECT and Partners are officially launching the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) on the 1st of October, 2014. ECSM is an EU advocacy campaign that promotes cyber security among citizens and advocates for change in the perception of cyber-threats by promoting data and information security, education, sharing of good practices and competitions. Official launch This year, the official launch of the ECSM is taking place alongside ENISA’s high-level event “10 years of securing Europe’s cyber security… and beyond!” at the premises of the Representation of the Free State of Bavaria to the European Union in Brussels. At the high-level event, ECSM will be addressing the issue of “Involving the citizen” with representatives  from Code week, the Grand Coalition for Jobs, European and US partners, followed by a discussion moderated by  Mr Francois Thill  from the Luxemburg (LU) ECSM coordination. Commissioner Kroes’ statement for the ECSM: ""The Internet and its many services bring many benefits to our society: not least significant growth of our economy and millions of jobs. But we need to build and restore trust if we really want to achieve those benefits. When it comes to cyber security, it is in our common interest to be much more responsive and resilient to cyber threats. ENISA can both play an operational and a strategic role to ensure that Europe is ready for the challenge, together with public and private parties.  Each one of us must play our part in the cyber-security challenge: every citizen, every business, every government. So I hope that the European Cyber Security Month raises more awareness – let's get people talking!"" ENISA’s Executive Director, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, commented: “The internet of things, where every electronic device will be uniquely accessible and identifiable over the internet, is approaching quickly. This has a profound impact on all aspects of citizens’ everyday life, as e-services are all now totally dependent on an open, safe and secure cyberspace. These are the technologies that are being built today and that will deliver the services of the future.  It is therefore essential for citizens to participate actively in improving information security, for ENISA to facilitate improvement processes and for Member States to ensure that security policy supports the internet based economy envisaged for Europe 2020. Year by year we have been consolidating this trust partnership for Cyber Security Month and I am honoured to see the high level of engagement from partners. On behalf of my team, thank you all! ”.

ENISA_PR_0738	2014-09-16	PR	System failures cause most large outages of electronic communications services according to a new ENISA report	 The Annual Incidents report 2013 provides an aggregated analysis of the security incidents in 2013 which caused severe outages. Most incidents reported to regulators and ENISA involved mobile internet and mobile telephony connections. The most frequent causes are system failures affecting mainly base stations and switches. The annual report is a result of an EU wide incident reporting process which started in 2012, under Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC). Incidents are reported nationally by operators to the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs). The most severe outages are reported annually by the NRAs to ENISA and the European Commission. The main findings are summarised below: 90 major incidents reported: This year 19 countries reported 90 significant incidents while 9 countries reported no significant incidents. Mobile networks most affected: Approximately half of the major outages involved mobile internet and mobile telephony. Impact on emergency calls: 21% of the major incidents also had an impact on emergency calls (access to 112). Majority (61%) of outages caused by system failures: Most of the time these system failures were software bugs, hardware failures and software misconfigurations affecting switches and base stations. Natural phenomena have most impact in terms of user-hours lost: Often severe weather (heavy snowfall, storms), led to power or cable cuts, which in turn led to severe outages in terms of user-hours lost. Assets mostly affected were base stations, switches and mobile switching.   The Executive Director of ENISA Professor Udo Helmbrecht comments: “Public communication networks and services are the backbone of the EU's digital society. Our goal is to help increase the resilience and security of electronic communications. Incident reporting and discussing actual incidents is essential to understand the risks and what can be improved. ENISA will continue collaborating with the EU's Telecom regulators to support efficient and effective reporting about security incidents”. This annual report does not mention specific countries or providers. Specific incidents will be discussed with the European Commission and the NRAs, within the Article 13a Expert Group. Where needed ENISA will support EU Member States to mitigate specific types of incidents. Following the reporting about the 2012 incidents, ENISA is working on a buyer-vendor guide to allow providers to manage security while procuring from ICT vendors and outsourcing partners for their core operations.   For full report: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013/ Background: Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC) in the EU legal framework for electronic communications.

ENISA's activities in this domain should not overlap with ongoing activities on NIS in the finance sector, but focus on cross-cutting and cross-sector issues. This means, for example;the financial sector's dependence on the telecom networks and services, the dependency on cloud computing, et cetera. Focus net list of future work Secondly, the group suggested a number of potential topics for focussing the work of the ENISA group. Below is a summary of the topics:. NIS and outsourcing: The problem for organisations in the finance sector to manage NIS, across the outsourced assets, and across the supply chain, for example in the case of cloud computing. Can certification and accreditation help here? Breach reporting: Breach reporting is becoming more and more important across the EU. How can we agree on a good and harmonized security breaches notification framework for the finance sector? Security of the communication networks and services: Banks currently struggle with a range of security issues in the electronic communication networks and services (CCLID spoofing, fake calls from banks, spoofed emails, phishing, hacked voicemail boxes, spoofed messages, DoS attacks, and so on).

ENISA_PR_0750	2014-06-26	PR	Fighting cybercrime: Strategic cooperation agreement signed between ENISA and Europol	 Scope The purpose of the agreement is to enhance cooperation between Europol, its European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), and ENISA in order to support the EU Member States and the EU institutions in preventing and combating cybercrime. The agreement does not cover the exchange of personal data. Cooperation may, in particular, include: the exchange of specific knowledge and expertise, elaboration of general situational reports, reports resulting from strategic analyses and best practice, strengthening capacity building through training and awareness raising, to safeguard network and information security at EU level. ENISA is part of the EC3 Programme Board and respectively EC3 is part of ENISA's Permanent Stakeholders Group which advises the (ENISA) Director on the yearly Work Programme and priorities. ENISA and EC3 have always worked hand in hand to reinforce EU-level cybersecurity and reduce cybercrime.  Work so far has included producing a joint paper on Botnet mitigation; participating in European CyberSecurity Month; cyber exercises such as CyberEurope; producing a good practice guide for CERTs; and enhancing CERT/law enforcement cooperation through different workshops and conferences, to name a few. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, and Europol Director, Rob Wainwright, issued a joint statement: “This agreement is an important step in the fight against ever more skilled cyber criminals who are investing more time, money and people on targeted attacks. Our agreement demonstrates that we are highly committed to jointly contributing within our respective areas of expertise, and to support each other’s work in the quest to make Europe a safer place online. Cybercrime is estimated to cost the global economy more than 400 billion dollars annually1, by cooperating more closely together and sharing expertise, we strengthen Europe’s capacity to combat cyber criminals.” Background ENISA is a body of expertise in cyber security, with its headquarters in Heraklion, and an office in Athens, Greece, which assists the EU Member States, the Commission and all related stakeholders to address and prevent  network and information security issues. * Europol, the European Police Office, located in The Hague, the Netherlands, is responsible for law enforcement cooperation at EU level, strengthening actions by the Member States in preventing and combating organised crime, terrorism and other forms of serious crime affecting two or more Member States (Council Decision 2009/371/JHA). EC3, the European Cybercrime Centre, hosted by Europol, is the focal point in the EU’s fight against cybercrime. It supports Member States and the European Union’s institutions in building operational and analytical capacity for investigations and cooperation with international partners, in the area of cybercrime. The specific areas of its mandate are (online) payment fraud, online child sexual exploitation, and crimes affecting critical infrastructure and information systems in the European Union.

ENISA_NEWS_0757	2014-05-27	NEWS	Security in Telecoms sector in focus of 2nd meeting of ENISA’s electronic communications reference group	   Objective: The objective of the group is to discuss and share experiences on security related issues in the telecom sector and to point to topics that need attention at EU level. Meeting Highlights: Telefónica showcased a solution they are developing on information sharing between providers. Experts stressed a need for peer to peer information sharing mechanisms that can be easily deployed. Key is to start small and concrete and to include stakeholders organically.  The running ENISA study on methodologies for identification of Critical Information Infrastructure and different implementations across Europe was discussed. Providers presented their approaches and a discussion was held on harmonization of critical infrastructure categorization and high availability requirements. Due to the cross border nature of infrastructure connectivity the group discussed possible approaches to incident reporting across borders. Big data was discussed and the providers shared their views on how to approach the increasing amount of data from a security and privacy point of view. ENISA's 2014 study on procurement of equipment and managed services for core operations was discussed. Providers would like to see guidelines regarding requirements on vendors and outsourcing partners when it comes to security and resilience. Incident reports that are submitted to ENISA by the telecom regulators could be made accessible also to providers in an anonymous way in order to learn from experiences in dealing with incidents. Providers at the meeting thought this would be beneficial and a model could be to opt-in: If you want to share you also get access.     ENISA will continue to build up the electronic communications reference group to get input on burning issues, test ideas and act as a bridge to national telecom regulators, the European Commission and actors in other sectors.   For more information about the ENISA Electronic Communications Reference Groups: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/ecrg     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0759	2014-05-19	NEWS	ENISA calls experts in Europe’s public sector to collaborate on a Cloud Certification Schemes Metaframework 	 ENISA has launched a survey to start the development of a cloud certification meta-framework. We are asking government experts to help us understand which are the security and privacy requirements they have to fulfil when procuring cloud services or other (similar) ICT services, such as outsourcing or webhosting. The survey, which is online at: http://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/ENISACCSMSurvey, is the first step to creating a cloud certification meta-framework. The meta-framework is an extension of the list of cloud certification schemes. Objective: The goal of the Cloud Certification Schemes Metaframework is to provide an easy online tool for experts in the public sector to understand which of their security and privacy requirements are addressed by existing information security certification schemes. In addition, this work will also provide a basis for discussions about which security and privacy requirements are still missing in today’s certification schemes. We invite experts who work in the EU’s public sector to fill out the survey and collaborate with us.

As such, this is a landmark decision for the privacy of the EU citizens. It is a fundamental ruling, deciding on a current, “hot” topic in the societal debate, namely how we deal with our personal data and the digital tracks we leave behind. Moreover, while naturally respecting the ECJ legal discretion and full independence as an EU-Institution, we are pleased to note that the ECJ ruling happens to be in line with ENISA’s recommendations on the topic; namely, in one of our earlier reports; we concluded; one way to overcome the challenges of the Right To Be Forgotten, and the balance in between technology and privacy was; ..."" the enforcement of the right to be forgotten is to require search engine operators and sharing services within the EU to filter references to forgotten information stored inside and outside the EU region."" This is a positive step in the correct direction; that you as a citizen should be able to delete your own, old data or photos online, just as you can do with printed paper. So, the ECJ has, independently supported our view; our assessment was correct, which we are pleased to take note of. Now, it will be interesting to follow how search engines will implement this in practice, as to protect the privacy of individuals and the right to protection of personal data of the EU citizen’s digital fundamental rights. Notably, the verdict only affects European citizens; in Asia and the United States they have a different understanding of Internet privacy. Yet, this is an important first step to develop the legal right for the citizens to delete their data, which is a process which is just in the beginning. We would like to have a global legal system for Internet which is prepared for the future; this is a fundamental issue for our society” Professor Helmbrecht concluded.   Background: See Conclusions in the ENISA report on the Right To Be Forgotten See also: ENISA's statement in Spanish and Swedish     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

Secondly, this is a token of evidence for that the CZ Republic has fully grasped the international, cross-border complexities of cyber security: Our society must offer resilient services, for e-health and bank transactions. We will now have the NCSC as a symbol for its international outlook and cooperation and to both build a better picture of cyber security and to encourage widespread debate to counter such scenarios. And this is needed for the economy of Europe and the resilience of our society; Attack on Europe and resilience An attack can lead to a take down of Europe’s electricity grids, or steal government records, or force governmental services offline. Why do we not do a better work here; why does industry not build in this as “security by design”? Why do we not make “Security made in Europe” our trademark; and harness the business opportunity latent in cyber security and for the economy of Europe? Organisations must also share security breaches for us to be able to reduce future losses. The ENISA led CERTs community building at EU-level has been successful in the fight against several botnets, (Mariposa, Zeus, Citadel and Virut)  and DDoS attack; the latter also taking place in CZ. Thus, we need more CERTs cooperation across in Europe, for the coordination of cooperation on both national and international level to prevent cyber-attacks, to propose and adopt measures for incident solving and against ongoing attacks, support training, trust building and CERTs community building; to set minimum capabilities standards; exchange of best practices and crucial knowledge among CERTS, and cyber security exercises, like Cyber Europe CE2014, which ENISA does on the EU level,); and the NCSC provides a perfect counter partner for ENISA and for Europe in this respect.” Professor Helmbrecht concluded.   The Executive Director also met with the Czech member of the ENISA Management Board, Jaroslav SMID, who has supported the NCSC development and ENISA’s work.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0767	2014-04-28	PR	ENISA statement related to the recent Internet Explorer vulnerability	 To clarify; ENISA is not an operational CERT, but a body of expertise, and can provide a brief situation analyses and comment nevertheless; This is a serious 0-day attack on society, “in-the-wild” attack, which demonstrates that there is no 100% security and how vulnerable society can be if security is not addressed from the start. Therefore, we advocate “security-by-design” from the start in the software process by industry. This is a significant threat for IE users as there is no quick fix to repair, and “patch” this Users who want to avoid the abovementioned risk should temporarily use another browser until this security gap has been fixed Users should keep their systems patched and up-to-date Many users have two different browsers installed so they should easily be able to switch. If not, this is a good reason why they should have it; when needed. If this is not possible, IE users should ensure that EMET 4.1 or 5.0 is installed and that all mitigations are enabled and that VML and Flash are disabled. Enhanced protection mode in IE should be activated. EPM was introduced in IE10 Users should always browse the Internet from the restricted user context and never from system administrator account One of the biggest problems with this vulnerability is that the Windows XP users will be exposed since no patch will be released for XP (End of life) As this affects around 26% of the total browser market, this displays how critical cyber security is for today’s society and economy. According to the security company FireEye, a known group of cyber criminals have already conducted targeted attacks on individuals and organisations. As this vulnerability becomes known, the tools and attack, may spread, in the near time. IE’s browser market share has dropped from 40% a few years ago, to around 25% now. In Europe, however, Mozilla and Google Chrome are the most used browers; while yet, some pockets of higher usage of IE can be found in Denmark, Greenland, parts of Italy, Netherlands and Monaco, in particular. Still, IE has a sizeable share of the users’ preferences in the EU, so caution is needed. IE is mainly the top browser in e.g. China and Angola.[1]   The Executive Director of ENISA professor Udo Helmbrecht commented: “We need to invest more in cyber security prevention and preparedness and equip EU bodies with the right resources, if we are to protect the economy and modern society of Europe. We take cyber access for granted, but still, some 40 years since it was invented, and the 20 years we have been dependent on the Internet, we still have a lot of security homework to do if we are to be able to enjoy the benefits of Internet.”   ENISA refers to Microsoft for any further updates, but till then all end users should use caution, and take lesson; it costs more later, not to invest in cyber security now.

ENISA_PR_0768	2014-04-28	PR	Biggest EU cyber security exercise to date: Cyber Europe 2014 taking place today	 More than 200 organisations and 400 cyber-security professionals across Europe join forces today during the first phase of ENISA’s bi-annual large scale cyber security exercise, Cyber Europe 2014. Twenty-nine EU and EFTA countries are participating in CyberEurope2014. In this phase, participants are called upon to resolve several technical cyber-security incidents, similar to recent real life cases. In this context, exercise players from the public (Cybersecurity Agencies, national/governmental CERTs, Ministries and Institutions) and private (Energy and Telecommunications) sectors are asked to investigate and analyse several scenarios which could impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of sensitive information or critical infrastructures. The exercise is organised bi-annually by the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security in cooperation with all EU Member States and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Compared to the previous two exercises, executed in 2010 and 2012, Cyber Europe 2014 has grown considerably in scope, scale and complexity. It will take place in three phases: technical (today), and later during the year; at 2. operational/tactical and 3. strategic/political levels. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, commented, “The incidents in Cyber Europe 2014 are very realistic, mimicking unrest and political crisis at a pan-European level, disrupting services for millions of citizens across Europe. Cyber Europe 2014 represents a major milestone in the efforts to strengthen cyber crisis cooperation, preparedness and response across Europe. This improves the resilience of Europe’s critical information infrastructures”. The objectives of Cyber Europe 2014 include testing of the existing standard cooperation procedures and mechanisms for managing cyber-crises in Europe; enhance national-level capabilities;  explore the existing cooperation between the private and public sector; analyse the escalation and de-escalation processes  (technical, operational and strategic level); understand the public affairs issues linked to large scale cyber-attacks.   Background: EU Cyber Security Strategy and the proposal for an EU Network and Information Security Directive COMMUNICATION on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection COM/2009/149 Digital Agenda for Europe First Cyber Europe exercise in 2010 Second Cyber Europe exercise in 2012 Standard Operational Procedures to manage multinational cyber-crises finalised by EU, EFTA Member States and ENISA Note: The exercise will not have an operational impact on critical information infrastructures, systems, or services.

ENISA_NEWS_0778	2014-04-03	NEWS	Security measures for smart grids - Dissemination workshop	" The Expert Group 2 (EG2) of the Smart Grid Task Force organised a workshop on security requirements for smart grids. The workshop took place yesterday, 2nd April 2014, in Brussels. The meeting's objectives were: To disseminate the report on the security measures for smart grids prepared by EG2 and delivered by ENISA to the Directorate-General for Energy (DG-ENER) last December. To discuss the next steps and the way forward on the continuation of the activities of the group.   ENISA, with the support of DG-ENER and DG-CONNECT, has concluded to a series of consultations with EG2. The Group consists of security experts from both the private and the public sectors. Background In its Communication on ""Smart Grids: from innovation to deployment"" [COM/2011/202], the European Commission has recognised that smart grids, as a Critical Infrastructure, should operate securely and respect end users' privacy. For this reason, the Commission has decided to further investigate the challenges of ensuring adequate smart grid protection in the EU. In light of the above, ENISA (European Agency for Network and Information Security), in cooperation with ENER and CNECT, undertook consultations with the private and public sectors in order to formulate security measures to assist smart grid providers in improving the infrastructures' cyber resilience.   Workshop This has led to the formulation of this document, entitled 'Proposal for a list of security measures for smart grid', containing 45 security measures structured in 11 security domains as well as the mapping of the identified security measures to the potential threats. The dissemination workshop for this report took place yesterday, 2 April 2014, in Brussels. This document is linked to ENER actions on smart grid cyber security as well as to CNECT's proposal for a NIS Directive (Objective 1.4.2).   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0789	2014-03-14	PR	A decade of securing Europe’s cyber future. The EU’s cyber security Agency ENISA is turning ten, and is looking at future challenges.	" On 14th March 2004, the first ENISA regulation was adopted by the EU (by the Council and the European Parliament). Ten years on, cyber security is even more crucial for the economy. As such, cyber security is high on the political and societal agenda. The ten-year milestone will be celebrated throughout the year with international and local events, taking stock of the past, as well as looking at the developments over the years, with a particular focus on future challenges. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, commented: “I am proud of what ENISA has achieved so far by successfully giving support to strengthen the cyber security capability in Europe through its prevention and preparedness activities. Examples include: Flashnotes providing information on significant cyber-attacks, etc., at the time they unfold. Organising the cybersecurity exercises Cyber Europe 2010, Cyber Atlantic 2011, Cyber Europe 2012. Training, support and further building of “digital fire brigades”; or CERT community, as well as the development of 8 governmental CERTs in 2005, to around 25 in 2014. Supporting the Members States: request for advice increased from 2 in 2010 to 14, so far, in 2014. Producing the annual Threat Landscape reports. Producing the annual major incidents report (Article 13a). Supporting the EU Cyber Security Month in October. Reports, guidelines and best practices, on issues of importance in the field of cyber security, such as Cloud Security, SCADA, e-ID, smart phones, social networks, data protection and cryptography, and much more.   Throughout this period, we have been a bridge between the public and private sectors, providing unique, independent advice with an EU-focus on cyber security. Although we are proud of what we have achieved so far over the past decade, we are still not satisfied. The battle with the cyber criminals is ongoing, like an “eternal marathon”. In addition, the political and societal demands on cyber security are constantly rising. This will be even more so in the future. We will face an increased need for more cyber security and a bigger, stronger and more enhanced ENISA in a digital society. This is necessary in order to reap the benefits of new technologies and business models, whilst containing the associated risks to a reasonable level. We thank our stakeholders for their support during the first ten years of the Agency, during which ENISA has evolved from a start-up to a mature organisation. We now we look forward to our further collaboration,” Executive Director Helmbrecht concludes. Statement by Vice President and EU Commissioner Neelie Kroes ""Europe's citizens and businesses are increasingly going online – bringing a huge benefit to our economy and society. But they have the right to stay secure when they do so: and they won't use what they can't trust. Combined with strong EU legislation for network and information security, ENISA's work is helping us build that trust and security, to make Europe the world's safest online space. I congratulate ENISA for their work over the last 10 years – and wish them the best of luck for the next 10 too.""   Background: EU Cyber Security Strategy For interviews; Ulf Bergström, Senior Corporate Communications Officer and Spokesman, ulf.bergstrom@enisa.europa.eu, mobile: + 30 6948 460 143, or Dr Steve Purser, Head of Core Operations, (through secretary) irma.wunderlin@enisa.europa.eu     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0791	2014-03-04	NEWS	ENISA helps with the Galileo Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) setting up process	 A delegation with representatives from the European GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) Agency met with ENISA experts in Athens today (4th March). The objective of the meeting was the exchange of information and the provision of support by ENISA with the Galileo CSIRT setting up process. Among the key points of the meeting agenda were: High-level view of the Galileo system CERT services and tools Good practice for public/governmental bodies Threat landscape mapping and information exchange Background: Galileo is the European global satellite-based navigation system. As the use of satellite-based navigation systems continues to expand, the implications of potential signal failure become even greater. Such an event, whether accidental or intentional, would jeopardise financial and communications activities, public utilities, security and humanitarian operations and emergency services. As far back as the early 1990s, the European Union saw the need for a European-controlled global satellite navigation system. The decision to build one was taken in the spirit of other well-known European endeavours, such as the Ariane launcher and Airbus.

ENISA_NEWS_0795	2014-02-26	NEWS	Large scale UDP attacks: How to combat the new cyber attack trend	 The Agency has followed the latest news that show an increase of large scale attacks exploiting specific vulnerabilities of the Internet core protocols. In the latest cases, the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which allows synchronizing devices to the coordinated universal time (UTC), has been misused. More specifically, in December 2013, a vulnerability in this UDP protocol became mainstream and started to be exploited for large scale reflection attacks leading to a dramatic increase of the size of denial of services. ENISA looks into the new trend and  issues a series of recommendations to network providers, which they can already put in place to mitigate these threats.

ENISA_NEWS_0796	2014-02-25	NEWS	ENISA’s Executive Director, Udo Helmbrecht, honored with the CSA Industry leadership award	" The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has named ENISA’s Executive Director, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, as the 2014 recipient of the CSA Industry Leadership Award. The CSA Industry Leadership Award is given to individuals in recognition of their contributions in advancing secure cloud computing initiatives. ENISA has been an affiliate member of CSA since its inaugural year of 2009. ""Professor Helmbrecht has approached the issue of cloud computing adoption with a strategic vision and healthy skepticism” Jim Reavis, CEO of the CSA, said. “As a business model, cloud computing offers many advantages over traditional computing and is revolutionising the way we use ICT”, the Executive Director Helmbrecht said, “ENISA believes there are important security opportunities as well, and we are working together with the public and the private sector to capitalize on these opportunities. Our goal is to ensure that security of cloud computing surpasses that of traditional computing models. In this way we ensure that good security practices stimulate economic growth. “I am honoured to receive this award from the Cloud Security Alliance and accept it on behalf of the entire staff at ENISA. The success of ENISA’s cloud security papers shows the power of collaboration between public sector, industry and industry associations. Without their engagement and support we would not be able to effectively promote better security practices in the EU. Collaborations with global industry associations, such as our partnership with CSA, are crucial for our mission: to be a centre of security expertise for the EU.”   For more information:  CSA Press Release       Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0797	2014-02-25	NEWS	ENISA new steps for building trust in the Cloud	 One of the main obstacles of adopting cloud is the lack of trust towards the cloud service provider. Before buying a cloud service, customers want to know if the service is secure and reliable. But cloud computing services are complex and built up from many different ICT components. “Questions like: “What can I expect from my cloud provider?”, “If I put my data into the cloud, will I lose control?” “Who is responsible for what happens to it?” may arise.  Many of those questions can be addressed by proper certification: schemes for adequate standards that are transparent and centered on the customer” commented the Vice President and Commissioner of the European Commission  Mrs Neelie Kroes.   Based on the existing schemes, ENISA has now delivered a list of certification schemes for cloud. The Agency has investigated: the specific certification schemes (based on the EU Cert.-SIG feedback), what standards and specifications they certify against, and who actually provides the assurance. This gives potential cloud customers more transparency about existing certification schemes and how they relate to the cloud.   For more information: ENISA Cloud Computing Certification Schemes List - CCSL Neelie Kroes blog post on CCSL: Making the cloud more transparent - a boost for secure, trustworthy services Background:  European Cloud Strategy     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0806	2014-02-05	PR	Standard Operational Procedures to manage multinational cyber-crises finalised by EU, EFTA Member States and ENISA	 The EU-SOPs give guidance on how to manage major cyber incidents that would escalate to a crisis. In particular, the EU-SOPs emphasise that in order to successfully manage cyber crises, direct links to the decision makers and political leadership level(s) are required. The objective of the EU-SOPs is to aid in the response to major cyber incidents, which can escalate to a cyber crisis.[1] In particular, these procedures will help to increase the understanding of the causes and impact of multinational cyber crises (situational awareness) and allow for quick and effective mitigation. Through a combination of contact points, guidelines, workflows, templates, tools, and good practices, the EU-SOPs offer European crisis managers the ability to use the internationally shared technical and non-technical information to draw an integrated operational picture and identify effective action plans. These can be presented to the political level for decision making. Multinational cyber crisis management requires the strong involvement of technical experts, while the operational crisis managers become more important as the criticality of incidents escalates over time. Most importantly, direct links to the decision makers at the strategic and political level are also considered essential. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, noted: “An effective response to multinational crises requires cross country cooperation for fast assessment and mitigation. These procedures will address the need for a handbook for predefined, commonly agreed upon and exercised operational contacts, procedures and processes.” For more information on ENISA cyber crisis cooperation Background: The draft EU-SOPs have been tested over the last three years, including during the pan-European exercises organised by ENISA: Cyber Atlantic in 2011 and Cyber Europe in 2012. The procedures are available for all public authorities of the EU/EFTA Member States involved in managing multinational cyber crises.

ENISA_PR_0809	2014-01-30	PR	Energy: cyber security is crucial for protection against threats for smart grids which are key for energy availability claims EU cyber security Agency in new report	 Secure governmental e-services are critical for society, e.g. health, procurement and justice. Security is crucial for gaining the trust of the EU citizens on using these services. However, there are many security challenges to overcome in order to ensure their successful deployment. The TSP study underlines that: Smart grids are complex “systems of systems,” storing, transporting and managing energy from production to consumers. A smart grid is de facto Critical Infrastructure as energy is crucial for society and for the well-functioning of the economy. By combining energy and information infrastructures, smart grids are critical infrastructures and should operate securely by respecting end users’ privacy. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, commented, “An understanding of the cyber-threat landscape is indispensable for identifying which protection measures are necessary for smart grids. This report is the response to the urgent question of energy providers and stakeholders: It provides the tools to assess risk exposure of smart grid assets. In cyber security, we need common efforts and coordination to reduce impact.” This report provides a threat landscape affecting smart grid components. It takes stock of available cyber security and protection approaches as well as good practices in the field. The study also lists internal threats affecting IT smart grid assets, including a variety of threats emanating from errors and insider attacks. Key conclusions: Some key conclusions identified are: Consider external and internal threats: in cyber security, external cyber threats constitute the main source of external exposure. This cyber threat environment originates from threat agents, utilising cyber threats and launching cyber attacks. Decompose and classify smart grid elements being exposed to threats: from electrical assets like cables, switches, routers, sensors and information to software such as  operating systems, services, hardware, infrastructure, and the persons operating the systems. Use available knowledge: reuse existing good practices after defining the level of desired protection. List the specific smart grids cyber threats, for example: Eavesdropping/interception/hijacking: e.g. information leaking, electro-magnetic/radio frequency interception, sniffer attacks, failures of devices and systems, attacks, and physical attacks, and the threat agents, such as corporations, cybercriminals, employees, hacktivists, nation states, natural disasters, terrorists, the new element of cyber fighters Assess vulnerabilities and risks in smart grids. Assessments to be done by asset owners: Finally, the Agency concludes that the threat exposure and risk assessment of a smart grid can only be done by the asset owner, who masters the complexity and interdependencies of the related smart grid infrastructure.   For full report: Smart Grid Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide   Background: ENISA reports on Smart grids (December 2012); 10 recommendations (July 2012) The EU Cyber Security Strategy, the proposal for a EU Cyber Security Directive   For interviews: Ulf Bergström, Spokesman, ulf.bergstrom@enisa.europa.eu, mobile: + 30 6948 460 143, Dr. Louis Marinos, ENISA Expert, resilience@enisa.europa.eu     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0811	2014-01-29	NEWS	Flash note: Risks of using discontinued software	 In its new flash note, the Agency explains the risks of using unmaintained software that arise not only from the lack of support by the software’s own manufacturer but also from the lack of support by third party software and hardware manufacturers (such as antimalware developers, computer peripherals manufacturers etc.) The lack of support will lead in persistent exposure to vulnerabilities as systems will no longer benefit from security updates and patches. In addition, this may lead to a lack of possibility to update peripherals or third party applications because of incompatibility issues. ENISA provides a set of recommendations for IT managers, manufactures and end-users in order to address the risks and ensure the security of their systems.   For the full Flash note: Risks of using discontinued software   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0812	2014-01-28	NEWS	European Data Protection Day, 28th January, 2014	 This year we are celebrating the 8th edition of Data Protection Day. This date is chosen as a reminder of 28th January 1981, when the Council of Europe adopted Convention 108, the first legally binding international instrument related to data protection. Why? Data protection issues, including their cross-border dimension, are always present in citizens’ lives – at work, in their relations with public authorities, in the health field, when they buy goods or services, when they travel or surf the internet. For whom? The aim of the Data Protection Day is to give everyone a chance to understand what personal data is collected and processed and why, and what our rights are with respect to this processing. EDPS video message ENISA would like to point to some of its recent work related to the area of data protection, privacy and trust: 2013 Security certification practice in the EU - Information Security Management Systems - A case study On the security, privacy and usability of online seals.

ENISA_PR_0813	2014-01-28	PR	Trustworthy electronic signatures, secure e-Government and trust: the way forward for improving EU citizens’ trust in web services, outlined by EU Agency ENISA	 Secure governmental e-services are critical for society, e.g. health, procurement and justice. Security is crucial for gaining the trust of the EU citizens on using these services. However, there are many security challenges to overcome in order to ensure their successful deployment. The TSP study underlines that: A mutual assistance system between supervisory bodies in the Member States should be set up. Client applications need to guarantee end-to-end encrypted communication with TSPs and e-Government services in order to safeguard EU citizens’ privacy. The e-Government document uses a few of the European Commission-funded Large Scale Pilots that integrate TSP (epSOS for health, e-CODEX for justice and PEPPOL for procurement) as case studies. These cases are used to analyse current practices and identify gaps and where improvements can be made. In this report, the Agency issues detailed technical security practices recommendations for TSP and e-Government Services using them, including time-stamping, e-delivery, long time preservation and e-signature validation. The more general TSP report from ENISA describes these services and the recommendations to improve their security in more detail. Key recommendations identified to offer trustworthy e-Government services to EU citizens include: Promote Trusted Marks assessed against eIDAS requirements that would be recognised across borders. Trust Services should be developed in a European scope, complying with both EU and local legislation. Specific Business Continuity Management standards should be adopted in the provision of trusted services (by TSPs) and required by e-Government customers. Based on the criticality of the e-government services, they should always assess three aspects: the strength of the authentication mechanisms to be used, encouraging the use of e-Signature. the need for end-to-end encryption and the need for audit trails to keep electronic evidence The guidelines for Trust Service Providers give recommendations in the areas of legal and regulatory framework of TSPs, risk assessment for TSPs and mitigation of security incidents. The main points highlighted by the reports include: legal acts in the EU and at the national level available standards applicable to trust services processes for effective risk management at TSPs handling of security incidents occurring at TSPs, such as impersonation, compromise of Certificate Authority, organisational failures, etc. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, stated: “It is vital for business and governments across Europe that citizens trust their online services and therefore implement the best technical e-signature solutions. These best practices need to be constantly reviewed through frequent risk analysis in order to keep up with the technical developments and overcome evolving cyber security challenges.” For the full reports Background: The proposed new Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions should supersede the current Directive 1999/93/EC.

ENISA_PR_0815	2014-01-23	PR	Outdated energy, water and transport Industrial Control Systems without sufficient cyber security controls require coordinated testing of capability at EU levels, says the EU’s cyber security Agency ENISA	   Nowadays, IT is being widely used by industrial control systems (e.g. SCADA) for energy, water and transport. This is used to improve efficiency, achieve cost savings, and to enable the automation of processes. Unfortunately, this often comes with poor planning, lack of information, security configurations, as well as with the incorporation of both well-known and new, undiscovered or yet unpatched “zero-day” vulnerabilities into ICS/SCADA systems. Iindustrial control Systems (ICS) may have a lifespan of over 20 years. Therefore, they have traditionally been designed as independent systems, without sufficient security requirements. Consequently, they are not prepared to deal with current threats. Overcoming today’s security gaps requires having a solid understanding of security (i.e. vulnerabilities, their origins, frequency, etc.). Proper security assessment demands specialised tools and methodologies. The Agency emphasises that there is a strong need for a specific strategy to define the objectives, the mission and the vision for a Testing Coordination Capability in the EU. This study explores how EU actions can be coordinated, so as to reach a level of harmonised, independent and trustworthy ICS testing of capabilities, which would then leverage current initiatives. The methodology includes desktop research, an online survey and in-depth interviews with 27 experts from the EU, the USA, Japan, India and Brazil. Key findings and recommendations This research has led to 36 key findings and 7 recommendations for both the public and private sectors, with a special focus on EU bodies: The creation of a Testing Coordination of Capability under public European leadership and strong support from the relevant public, national authorities and the private sector in the EU. The establishment of a trusted and functional Executive Board to enforce leadership The creation or involvement of specific working groups Definition of a financial model which is suitable given the European situation Carrying out a feasibility study regarding how testing should be organised. Establish collaboration agreements with other organisations dealing with ICS security Establish a knowledge management programme for ICS testing.   The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht observed: “There is an evident necessity to increase security in Critical Information Infrastructure and ICS system; the risks are increasing, and highly knowledgeable attackers and natural disasters have shown the weaknesses of the systems. All public and private entities involved are strongly advised to seriously address these security concerns.” For full report: Good Practices for an EU ICS Testing Coordination Capability Background: EU Cyber Security Strategy For interviews; Ulf Bergström, Spokesman, ulf.bergstrom@enisa.europa.eu, mobile: + 30 6948 460 143, or Adrian Pauna, Expert,  resilience@enisa.europa.eu     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0816	2014-01-22	NEWS	News Flash/Statement re; 16 Million e-identities & passwords theft	" Statement by the Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht regarding the major theft of 16 Million e-identities and passwords announced by the German Federal Office for Information Security, BSI yesterday, which was widely reported about in media e.g here; “The theft of the passwords demonstrates the importance of building better passwords. It also shows that the networks of hijacked computers -so called botnets- are key for serious criminal activities and fraud. The human factor is still the weak link in IT security; it is not about technology. Mankind is the security issue here; so, companies have to become even better in educating and ""patching” your staff. This is in particular true for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, SMEs, which in fact constitute around 98% of Europe’s economy. The SMEs usually lack the skills, knowledge, people and funds to properly invest in IT-security. Security by design Banks, e-government services, and all service providers online should enforce stronger and long enough passwords; it should simply not be possible to construct a weak password to access private or public services. This is called “security by design”-and is a well-known concept in theory, but still many companies and public bodies do not always opt construct their systems this way; they do not select the best solution, but a cheaper solution instead. This should not go on. The public authorities need to become better at teaching how passwords are built; with variations of letters, numbers, symbols, built in typos, shifting between capital and miniscule letters. This can be done through games, to test and learn how to step –by-step build your passwords in a safer way and we as citizens must all learn not to use the same password everywhere. This shows how weak the access and identification systems presently are, and that industry and public bodies and companies as employers alike have to take a greater responsibility to enforce that people use smarter passwords. ENISA has also underlined some of these emerging risks, threats and trends of identity hijacking,  etc in its Annual Threat Landscape report for 2013, and yesterday launched a report regarding how banks and the financial sector should enforce more secure  e-identities and e-payments.

ENISA_PR_0817	2014-01-21	PR	EU cyber security Agency ENISA calls for secure e-banking and e-payments: non-replicable, single-use credentials for e-identities are needed in the financial sector	 The report analyses current e-Finance fraud and correlates it with the financial institutions’ customers’ authentication mechanisms. The report emphasises the need for updated security mechanisms and provides 10 recommended approaches. The Agency analysed more than 100 replies to a survey distributed to merchants and e-banking security professionals on the electronic IDentity and Authentication Systems (eIDAS) used by citizens and customers in e-Finance and e-Payment systems. Additionally, the Agency identified the risk and the attack patterns concerning each authentication mechanism, including phishing, ID-theft, session and identity hi-jacking, etc., of the financial institutions, merchants and payment service providers. As a result, the Agency produced guidelines, best practices and recommendations for e-banking and Internet payments. Key recommendations are Improve the security of the e-Finance environment, meaning that financial actors must: Make risk analysis based on customers’ profile and size of the institution, Improve customers’ awareness and skills, Implement authentication methods tailored to the customer behaviour profiles and transactions parameters (e.g. destination country, amount) Early detection of customers’ device compromise through device registration, testing and evaluation of its security. (”Assume all devices are infected”) Improve the security of e-Finance applications and their distribution channels to customers: encouraging the traditional “security by design”, taking into account the proposed new personal data protection Directive, and using trusted channels to install applications in the customers’ device. Promote proportionality between selected method(s) robustness and the identified risk (adequacy of eIDAS to transaction context). with emphasis on the use of 2 factor authentication (e.g ATMs: a card and a PIN code) even for low risk operations. Improve knowledge and the behaviour of customers and professionals: To summarise, today current eIDAS practices in the financial sector do not cover many risks. The ECB and European Commission are developing recommendations and regulations aligned with the ENISA report to identify and set up tools to reduce losses due to fraud. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht commented: “The financial sector manages e-transactions of hundreds of billions of euro every year. Therefore, secure e-identities and authentication is simply a must for the economy. The financial institutions should use security as a competitive marketing tool. With this report, the financial actors can make a cost/benefit analysis of additional authentication mechanisms.”   For full report: eID Authentication methods in e-Finance and e-Payment services   Background: The proposals for the EU data-protection directive, and Payment Services Directive 2, ECB “Recommendations for the security of Internet payments” For interviews; Ulf Bergström, Spokesman, ulf.bergstrom@enisa.europa.eu, mobile: + 30 6948 460 143, Manel Medina, ENISA Expert, sta@enisa.europa.eu   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0819	2014-01-17	PR	From transparency to trust in the Cloud: EU Cyber security Agency ENISA advises how to implement incident reporting in cloud computing	 Cloud security incidents often catch the media’s attention as they affect large number of users; for example, recently a large storage service provider suffered an outage lasting two days. However, due to the lack of consistent reporting schemes regarding cloud security incidents, it is hard to understand the causes and impact of these incidents. To comprehend the resilience and security of cloud computing services better, it is important to discuss the topic with the industry and government and find common ground as regards pragmatic incident reporting schemes, which would provide useful information to customers and government authorities. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht remarked: “Incident reporting is crucial to enable better understanding of the security and resilience of Europe’s critical information infrastructures. Cloud computing is now becoming the backbone of our digital society, so it is important that cloud providers improve transparency and trust by adopting efficient incident reporting schemes. ” The report looks at four different cloud computing scenarios and investigates how incident reporting schemes could be set up, involving cloud providers, cloud customers, operators of critical infrastructure and government authorities: Cloud service used by a critical information infrastructure operator; Cloud service used by customers in multiple critical sectors; Cloud service for government and public administration (a gov-cloud); Cloud service used by SMEs and citizens.   Using surveys and interviews with experts, we identified a number of key issues: In most EU Member States, there is no national authority to assess the criticality of cloud services. Cloud services are often based on other cloud services. This increases complexity and complicates incident reporting. Cloud customers often do not put incident reporting obligations in their cloud service contracts.   The report contains several recommendations, based on feedback from cloud experts in industry and government: Voluntary reporting schemes hardly exist and legislation might be needed for operators in critical sectors to report about security incidents. Government authorities should address incident reporting obligations in their procurement requirements.   Critical sector operators should address incident reporting in their contracts.    Incident reporting schemes can provide a “win-win” for providers and customers, increasing transparency and, in this way, fostering trust. Providers should lead the way and set up efficient and effective, voluntary reporting schemes.   For full report Background: Proposed NIS Directive EU Cyber Security Strategy For interviews; Ulf Bergström, Spokesman, ulf.bergstrom@enisa.europa.eu, mobile: + 30 6948 460 143, or Dimitra Liveri/Marnix Dekker, Experts, Cloud.Security@enisa.europa.eu   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0821	2014-01-15	PR	Privacy revisited: clearer icons, standards and evaluation of online seals are needed for online trust	 When can you actually trust the web services to safely handle your data? A new report by the EU’s cyber security agency ENISA analyses the conditions under which online security and privacy seals help users to evaluate the trustworthiness of a web service. The report underlines the need for clear icons, standards, assessment and evaluation methodology. Furthermore, a second report addresses the framework, methodology and evaluation for security certification and provides a qualitative analysis of certification practices in the EU. Numerous policy documents identify marks, seals, logos, icons (collectively referred to as “seals”). These help users to judge the trustworthiness of services offered on the web. But there are many obstacles for users to use these seals, as it is not clear how the seals are granted to the services. ENISA analyses the current situation and identifies key challenges, solutions, and recommendations for online seals. Key challenges and recommendations: The two reports deal with (1) how users can use seals to base their trust in a service, and (2) what  we can learn from other certification initiatives to improve these seals. Some of the key challenges and corresponding recommendations are: Users suffer from information overload. Therefore, web designers need to develop clearer privacy icons, which are based on research, including cultural and legal differences.  Users are not sufficiently aware of what seals mean. Educational material should be provided to spread knowledge of the existence and meaning of seals. Seals are not checked by the user. Service providers and web developers need to provide and implement seals that can be automatically checked. Transparency. Policy makers should demand reliable statistics on certification and seals. The bodies issuing certificates/seals should keep updated, public records on certificates/seals that they have issued. Reduction of burden. Standardization bodies and responsible stakeholders should develop best practices and standards merging the requirements for security and data protection in order to reduce burden. Enforcement. The national policy makers should ensure enforcement of such requirements for genuine compliance, for instance by applying sanctions and/or ad-hoc assessments carried on by third parties. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht remarked: “The effectiveness of trust signals must be improved. Regulatory bodies at the EU and national level should set incentives for service providers to obtain better online security and privacy protection”.   For full reports: ENISA, On the security, privacy and usability of online seals   ENISA, Security certification practice in the EU - A case study, Background: EU Cyber Security Strategy For interviews; Ulf Bergström, Spokesman, ulf.bergstrom@enisa.europa.eu, mobile: + 30 6948 460 143, or Rodica Tirtea/Stefan Schiffner, Experts, sta@enisa.europa.eu     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0825	2014-01-08	PR	New report with check list of recommendations to the electronic communications sector on how to withstand and act efficiently after power cuts, calling for increased exchange on situational awareness.	 ENISA’s annual report about major incidents in the EU identified that power cuts are a dominant cause of severe network and service outages in the EU’s electronic communications sector. Electronic communications networks and services are the backbone of the EU’s digital society, indispensable for citizens, businesses, governments and organisations to communicate and exchange information. The Agency makes eight recommendations to National Regulatory Authorities (NRA) and providers within the electronic communications sector to reduce the risk of network and service outages caused by power supply failures. NRAs should: analyse the frequency and impact of network outages caused by power cuts. liaise with providers to collect good practices to increase resilience against power cuts. perform a cost-benefit analysis to determine a suitable minimum level of resilience against power cuts. take lessons learned from outages caused by power cuts and ensure that affected providers work systematically to develop their protection measures. act to establish a strategy to promote cooperation and mutual aid agreements on joint service restoration after severe power cuts. consider a priority scheme that would give preferential treatment within the electronic communications sector and decrease service restoration times under exceptional circumstances.   Providers should regularly perform checks of existing protection measures, to ensure that shorter and medium duration power cuts will not have any negative impact. NRAs, providers, and actors in the energy sector should, in the case of severe power cuts, cooperate to establish information exchange mechanisms to enable an efficient exchange of situational awareness information and forecasts of restoration times.   The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht commented: “The recommendations outline the necessary steps to reduce the risk of network outages and boosts ability to manage outages caused by power supply failures. We encourage the different actors to find ways to improve information-sharing about failures and outages, particularly between the energy sector and the electronic communications sector.  ” For full report:Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector   Background: ENISA Annual Incidents Report, and EU Cyber Security Strategy For interviews; Ulf Bergström, Spokesman, ulf.bergstrom@enisa.europa.eu, mobile: + 30 6948 460 143, or Christoffer Karsberg, Expert, resilience@enisa.europa.eu     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0830	2013-12-12	NEWS	Summing up: Cyber security & data privacy in focus at successful ENISA High Level Event	" The annual ENISA High Level Event took place in Brussels on 11h December with more than 200 key policy actors, academia and industry partners attending. The focus of the debate was on cyber security and data protection; a discussion on soft law vs hard law and dialogue. The topic of this year’s event was “Securing the cyber-future: risks, threats, challenges and opportunities for coordinating Europe’s cyber security” and took place in the Representation of the State of Hessen to the EU premises. The event cooperation was also undertaken with the support of the European Security Round Table. Some gemstones from the event: Dr Zsuzsa Breier, State Secretary for European Affairs of the State of Hessen, clarified the need for cyber security at all levels, EU, Member States, and at regional level, and how cooperation is necessary to better address this issue. Robert Madelin, Director General of DG CONNECT of the European Commission made an intervention regarding ""Improving cybersecurity in the EU"" which primarily outlined the new ENISA Regulation welcoming it as it is strengthening ENISA, making the agency more operational in multisites, and detailed what it means for improving Europe's cyber security; the Cyber Security Strategy and NIS Directive - the practicalities of its implementation; EU Horizon2020, launched yesterday (11th December). These topics provided a fond for further discussions and debate in the light of the recent implications of state surveillance revelations for IT security. Mr Peter Hustinx, EDPS Supervisor intervened with an update on the Status of the new DP legislation and clarified its impact on the Cyber Security Strategy. Notably, he clarified that privacy could be a perception issue which does not exclude security. He also underlined that there is big consensus on the need for both more security and privacy. Tomas Jakimavicius, Telecommunications Counsellor at the Permanent Representation of Lithuania to the European Union clarified the main achievements during the Lithuanian presidency and the challenges ahead, including the need for more international cooperation on incident reporting. Two industry perspectives were given, industry perspective 1 : by Mr John Higgins, Director General at DigitalEurope, who made a contribution regarding “Risks & Rewards; costs and confidence-a fine business balance”, whereas industry perspective 2 was provided by Mr John Lyons, CEO as ICSPA, who made his intervention on the “Potential impact on business operations form the EU’s Cyber security strategy & NIS Directive”. Then a QA session panel followed, with Mr Gustav Kalbe of the European Commission, with summary and conclusions. The panel members had an interesting discussion with diverging opinions on where the exact balance needs to be struck in relation to soft vs hard law, the need for dialogue, and a risk balanced approach. Professor Udo Helmbrecht mentioned the launch of the ENISA annual Cyber Threats landscape report in conjunction with the event, and commented; We would most sincerely like to thank the State of Hessen for the excellent venue for the High Level Event, and for generously hosting this event in their new building, as well as the ESRT for excellent cooperation and support, as well as the speakers, and the audience, which all were necessary for making this even such a great success in terms of the quality of the debate, speakers, venue, topic, organisation, and attendance (more than 200 participants attending). The debate also generated a Twitter flow under the hashtag #HLE13eu and social media interaction which also contributed to event reaching out to many more persons.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0831	2013-12-12	NEWS	New ENISA study on recognition mechanisms for CERTs	 The new study introduces these mechanisms according to the CERT maturity levels that they address, based on eight predefined criteria including requirements that CERTs must meet; CERTs’ focus: type or region; and definitions and terminology used. Reasons for harmonisation: As partly confirmed by direct consultations with CERTs during the study, CERTs are in need of harmonisation for the following reasons: Requirements and validation process: CERTs need to meet and adhere to different requirements, which is resource- and time-intensive. This would be much more effective and easier based on harmonisation across the CERT community. Definitions and terminology: Many terms and definitions used by CERT organisations are already similar. Harmonising core terms such as CERT (CSIRT), constituency, or incident would make these mechanisms significantly more compatible and make it easier for CERTs to subscribe to, or utilise, various mechanisms. CERT types (sectors): It could be beneficial for different mechanisms to harmonise their definitions of sectors that vertical-specific CERTs typically focus on, and to specify clearly various constituency types, as doing so would offer more clarity and transparency surrounding CERT activities. Training: Harmonisation could lead to synergies, proliferation of training opportunities for CERTs, and more opportunities for CERTs to meet and share good practices.

ENISA_PR_0833	2013-12-11	PR	ENISA lists top cyber-threats in this year’s Threat Landscape Report.	 Among the key findings is that cyber threats have gone mobile, and that adoption of simple security measures by end-users would reduce the number of cyber incidents worldwide by 50%. The study is published in conjunction with the Agency’s annual High Level Event in Brussels on 11 December. The ENISA Threat Landscape presents the top current cyber threats of 2013 and identifies emerging trends. In 2013 important news stories news, significant changes and remarkable successes have left their footprint in the cyber-threat landscape. Both negative and positive developments have formed the 2013 threat landscape. In particular: Negative trends 2013: Threat agents have increased the sophistication of their attacks and of their tools. Clearly, cyber activities are not a matter of only a handful of nation states; indeed  multiple states have developed the capacity to infiltrate both governmental and private targets. Cyber-threats go mobile: attack patterns and tools targeting PCs which were developed a few years ago have now migrated to the mobile ecosystem. Two new digital battlefields have emerged: big data and the Internet of Things. Positive developments in the cyber threat trends in 2013 include: Some impressive law-enforcement successes ; police arrested the gang responsible for the Police Virus; the Silk Road operator as well as the developer and operator of Blackhole, the most popular exploit kit, were also arrested. Both the quality and number of reports as well as the data regarding cyber-threats have increased Vendors gained speed in patching their products in response to new vulnerabilities.   A table of the top current threats and threat trends lists the following top three threats:  1. Drive-by-downloads, 2. Worms/Trojans and 3. Code injections. For full table. Key open issues, identified are: The end-users lack knowledge yet they need to be actively involved. Adoption of simple security measures by end-users would reduce the number of cyber incidents for 50% worldwide! Numerous actors work on overlapping issues of threat information collection and threat analysis. Greater coordination of information collection, analysis, assessment and validation among involved organisations is necessary. The importance of increasing the speed of threat assessment and dissemination, by reducing detection and assessment cycles has been identified. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht remarked: “This threat analysis presents indispensable information for the cyber security community regarding the top threats in cyber-space, the trends, and how adversaries are setting up their attacks by using these threats.” For ful report: ENISA Threat Landscape report 2013 Background: EU Cyber Security Strategy For interviews; Ulf Bergström, Spokesman, ulf.bergstrom@enisa.europa.eu, mobile: + 30 6948 460 143, or Dr. Louis Marinos , Expert,  resilience@enisa.europa.eu     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0834	2013-12-10	NEWS	ENISA publishes new study on securing personal data in the context of data retention	" ENISA's new report aims at providing a set of recommendations for a common European approach on the security measures that should be taken in relation to retained data, taking into account existing specifications on security measures. The new study provides the results of (a) a survey on the national implementation of the Data retention legislation in six selected Member States on the requirements regarding technical and organisational security measures and the implementation of the data security principles that are provided for in the Directive, and (b) a state-of-the-art analysis of the security measures proposed for the protection of personal data collected and stored in the context of the DRD. Data Retention Directive: In the case of the Data Retention Directive being revised, ENISA makes the following recommendations to European Commission for consideration in the context of the DRD Review process: Include clear references to minimum security requirements for personal data protection.  State-of-the-art security frameworks have already been developed; changing the security mechanisms is neither easy nor inexpensive, however minimum security requirements should be imposed.  A clear and realistic threat model should be considered, including also the reference to “deliberate” destruction, loss or alteration, storage, processing, access or disclosure. Take into account the recently published measures applicable to the notification of personal data breaches included in the EC regulation (EU) No 611/2013 when specifying the appropriate technical and organisational security protection measures for retained data. Taking into account the difficulties of smaller companies in complying with data retention obligations, and considering the possibilities that providers would consider outsourcing models for the storage of the retained data, which can potentially take place in third countries outside the EU, there should be no discrimination regarding the quality of personal data protection but consideration should be taken regarding the costs of implementing the required security measures. Take into account the risks inherent in outsourcing the storage of retained data and provide clear rules on whether and, if so, how providers shall be allowed to outsource the storage of retained data. Provide clear instructions on the procedures that have to be followed at the end of the retention period, when the data are to be deleted securely.  ENISA could support this by preparing guidelines for this purpose. Include clear provisions on audits on compliance with the security measures that are taken for the retained data, specifying the time period within which an audit should be carried out and the entity that should be performing the audit (This recommendation is made sharing the opinion of Art 29 WP).  Harmonise the time period within which the retained data have to be transmitted to the competent authorities. Harmonise the sanctions that can be imposed when companies do not comply with the data security principles.   For the full ENISA report: Securing personal data in the context of data retention Background: Data retention legislation has been adopted to address concerns related to national security and serious criminal activity. The legislation provides access to communication data for law enforcement purposes. However, according to the Data Retention Directive (DRD) personal data collected, stored or in any way processed in most European Union (EU) Member States (MSs) needs to be securely protected, to meet the requirements of data protection legislation. The transposition of the Data Retention Directive, published in 2006, into national legislation, has been, and still is, a challenging task. In light of the review of the Data Retention Directive an evaluation of the Directive was scheduled by the European Commission (EC) for 2010, aiming towards assessing the application and the impact of its implementation for different stakeholders. Following  a request by the Directorate General Home Affairs (DG HOME) of the EC, ENISA is supporting this process; ENISA (a) assessed the current implementation of data security measures for data retention in selected Member States and provides ""best practice"" recommendations in this respect and (b) provides state-of-the art recommendations for security measures in the context of data retention reform.       Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0835	2013-12-06	PR	EU cyber security Agency ENISA argues that better protection of SCADA Systems is needed	  Much of Europe’s critical infrastructure resides in sectors such as energy, transportation, water supply. These infrastructures are largely managed and controlled by SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems (a subgroup of Industrial Control Systems (ICS). In the last decade SCADA technology has gone from being isolated systems into open architectures and standard technologies that are highly interconnected with other corporate networks and the Internet. A consequence of this transformation is the increased vulnerability to outside attacks. One way to enhance the security of SCADA is through the application of patches. At the moment, two of the key important issues with patching are the failure rate of patches (60%)[1] and the lack of patches; less than 50% of the 364 public vulnerabilities had patches[2] available for SCADA. We have identified several best practices and recommendations regarding patching that can improve the security posture of SCADA environments, from which we would like to mention the following: Compensating Controls : Increase in depth defence through network segmentation to create trusted zones that communicate using access controls ; Hardening the SCADA systems by removing unnecessary features; Usage of techniques such as Application White Listing and Deep Packet Inspection Patch management program and service contract: Asset owners should also establish a patch management service contract  to define on the responsibilities of both the vendor and the customer in the patch management process; Asset owners should always conduct their own tests. This can be done virtually or by maintaining separate systems to test on. Certified systems should be re-certified after a patch is applied. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht remarked: “Although patch management is not a silver bullet to resolve the security issues of SCADA systems it is nevertheless important that organisations establish a patch management policy. The European Union or the Member States could increase the awareness of patches through enforcing patch management when new requirements for devices are established.“ For full report Background: EU Cyber Security Strategy, For interviews; Ulf Bergström, Spokesman, ulf.bergstrom@enisa.europa.eu, mobile: + 30 6948 460 143, or Adrian Pauna, Expert,  adrian.pauna@enisa.europa.eu [1] “In 2011, ICS-CERT saw a 60% failure rate in patches fixing the reported vulnerability in control system products.”(Kevin Hemsley –ICS-CERT) [2] Less than 50% of the 364 public vulnerabilities recorded at ICS-CERT had patches available at that time.” (SCADA Security Scientific Symposium (S4) in January 2012, Sean McBride)     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0836	2013-12-04	PR	Mitigating attacks on Industrial Control Systems (ICS); the new Guide from EU Agency ENISA	 Industrial Control Systems are indispensable for a number of industrial processes, including energy distribution, water treatment, transportation, as well as chemical, government, defence and food processes. The ICS are lucrative targets for intruders, including  criminal groups, foreign intelligence, phishers, spammers or terrorists. Cyber-incidents affecting ICS can have disastrous effects on a country’s economy and on people’s lives. They can cause long power outages, paralyse transports and cause ecological catastrophes. Therefore, the ability to respond to and mitigate the impact of ICS incidents is crucial for protecting critical information infrastructure and enhancing cyber-security on a national, European and global level. Consequently, ENISA has prepared this guide about good practices for prevention and preparedness for bodies with ICS-CERC and highlights the following conclusions; While for traditional ICT systems the main priority is integrity, for ICS systems availability is the  highest priority (of the “CIA” scale : Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.) This has to do with the fact that ICS are indispensable for the seamless operation of critical infrastructure. The main ICS actors sometimes do not have sufficient cyber-security expertise. Likewise, the established CERTs do not necessarily understand sector-specific technical aspects of ICS. Given the potential significant damage of ICSs, the hiring process for ICS-CERC teams requires staff to be vetted thoroughly, and consideration should be given to many things, for example, an individual’s ability to perform under pressure and response willingness during non-working hours. The importance of cooperation at both the domestic and international level must be recognised. The unique challenges of ICS cyber-security services can be mitigated by using identified good practices for CERTs, existing global and European experiences, and better exchange of good practices. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht stated: “Until a few decades ago, ICS functioned in discrete, separated environments, but nowadays they are often connected to the Internet. This enables streamlining and automation of industrial processes, but it also increases the risk of exposure to cyber-attacks.“ For full report; Good practice guide for CERTs in the area of Industrial Control Systems   Background: EU Cyber Security Strategy.

ENISA_NEWS_0839	2013-11-28	NEWS	Attacks against information systems - good practice collection for CERTs 	 Today ENISA publishes its Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the EU Directive on attacks against information systems.  It was produced to support the efficient functioning of CERTs/CSIRTs and their cooperation with law enforcement agencies (LEAs) in the face of a new development in European cybercrime policy. ENISA's new report serves two major goals, which both aim at supporting CERTs/CSIRTs: Firstly to provide an analysis of the legal framework created by the Directive, coupled with a stock taking on relevant existing national activities and good practices; Secondly, the identification of key areas and, where appropriate, guidelines and recommendations derived from these good practices   For the full report: A Good Practice Collection for CERTs on the Directive on attacks against information systems Background: In 2010, the European Commission published a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and the Council on attacks against information systems . This proposal was intended to further streamline the legal framework in the Member States in relation to the definition and punishment of certain cybercrime incidents, and tackled several challenges which were not adequately dealt with under prior rules, such as notably the creation, use and dissemination of cybercrime tools, the penalisation of illegal interception, the use of botnets, and identity theft.  The proposal was adopted by the European Parliament on 22 July 2013 and published in the Official Journal on 14 August 2013 as Directive 2013/40/EU. The Directive, which Member States will need to transpose by 4 September 2015, imposes new obligations, tasks and expectations on certain key stakeholders, including CERTs/CSIRTs, LEAs, security specialists, telecommunications service providers, etc.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0840	2013-11-27	PR	“Using national roaming to mitigate mobile network outages” New report by EU cyber security Agency ENISA	 Mobile communication networks and services have become an integral part of everyday life. People are now more and more reliant on their mobile phone and expect to be connected anywhere at any time. Neelie Kroes, the European Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, remarked, “Telecom affects everything and users are developing massive expectations of it. Markets must function, devices must function, networks must function and investment needs to happen.” Outages of mobile networks can have a severe impact on both the economy and society and are also common. In 2012, half of the major communication outages reported by EU Member States to ENISA under Article 13a were mobile network outages. Sometimes mobile network outages can last several days. For example, in 2012 a fire affected a telecom infrastructure in the Netherlands and a large number of customers across the country were unable to use the mobile network for several days. The outage had a severe impact across a densely populated urban area, vital to the economy. National roaming could work as a fallback during severe mobile network outages, allowing subscribers of the affected operator to roam on other mobile networks in their country and in this way continue to communicate even when own operator’s network is down. In this report, we look at national roaming from a security and resilience perspective. We analyse different national roaming solutions and discuss the pros and cons and present a portfolio of schemes. ENISA also makes recommendations, for example to discuss possible national roaming schemes with providers and to support the establishment of mutual aid agreements between providers in case of severe incidents. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht commented “We have investigated national roaming as a solution for mitigating outages. This can improve security and resilience of European communications networks, and ensure that European citizens can communicate at all times, also during major outages.”   For full report and all recommendations Background: ENISA’s 2012 report about major incidents in the telecom sector, plus, an animation showing the data about the reported incidents and a video about incident reporting in the telecom sector.

ENISA_NEWS_0844	2013-11-21	NEWS	1st Meeting of ENISA’s electronic communications reference group in Rome	 The group’s goal is to provide telecom providers with the opportunity to give feedback on ENISA’s work and on telecom regulation in general. The highlights from the meeting include: The experts from Telecom providers stressed the importance of keeping security and resilience legislation and leaving the specific technical details about security measures up to providers. Providers should be responsible for choosing the measures to meet the security and resilience objectives of governments. A major topic of debate was the impact of power cuts on electronic communications. Telecom providers are often kept in the dark about the quality and resilience of power supply and they are also often unaware about where outages are likely to occur. Providers should be better informed about on-going outages and what is the forecasted restoration time via priority channels. Telecoms are a critical sector and cannot be treated as normal domestic users. During the meeting it was also stressed that these issues cannot be left entirely to the market, as in many countries market mechanisms in the energy sector are hardly mature. Energy regulators or civil protection agencies should discuss with telecom regulators and telecom providers to address the critical dependency between the two sectors. Experts stressed the importance of using digital structured formats (XML, private RSS feeds, etc) for exchanging information about vulnerabilities and threats to prepare the ground for easier sharing of information with other providers and government authorities, nationally and across border. An additional concern for telecom providers is the increased dependency on ICT products and the fact that many security incidents are caused by failures and vulnerabilities in ICT products and services. Providers encouraged ENISA to develop a set of requirements for ICT vendors supplying products to the telecom sector. ENISA will continue to build up this group and work on specific security and resilience issues which affect providers across the European Union, acting as a bridge between the EU telecom market, telecom regulators and regulators in other sectors.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0845	2013-11-21	NEWS	New report on certification: Reforming the Data Protection legislation; lessons learnt from security certification 	 The EU Agency ENISA releases a new study on security certification schemes. The recently published EU Cybersecurity Strategy stated the need to develop industrial and technical resources for cybersecurity. Among the actions is to “create incentives to carry out appropriate risk management and adopt security standards and solutions, as well as possibly establish voluntary EU-wide certification schemes building on existing schemes in the EU and internationally”. Consequently, ENISA has produced this report on security certification. Objectives This study has two objectives: The first objective is to provide expertise from other certification areas to the reform of the European data protection legislation, as the new proposed legislation identifies privacy certification as a means to achieve implementation of data protection requirements.  The second objective is to identify recommendations and steps to be followed for achieving the objectives of the EU cyberstrategy, namely the development of voluntary EU-wide certification schemes building on existing schemes in the EU. In order to collect experiences from existing certification schemes and given the broad range of existing certification schemes, this study looks at Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) certification. Survey For the collection of practical experiences of private companies and public organisations for Information Security Management Systems certification a survey was conducted in a set of Member States. The respondents are representing more than 50% of EU population and covered Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Slovakia, United Kingdom.  The survey provides information on existing accreditation bodies and schemes, as well as on certification bodies and schemes. Some of key findings of the survey: In certain MSs national legislation requires information security certification in specific sectors, such as public healthcare. National authorities are encouraging the implementation of certification processes for ISMS (e.g. by introducing specific information security certification requirements in case of participation in public procurement). The large majority of companies that own a security certificate consider this as useful for their functioning, as the certification process ensures a regular and systematic identification of risks and evaluation, etc. and also provides competitive advantages.   Some key recommendations of this study:  There are limitations in the statistics on existing certification processes.  We recommend that policy makers (i.e. the European Commission) or the responsible authorities (i.e. national supervising authorities in the area of accreditation and certification) should demand reliable statistics on certification. The bodies issuing certificates should keep updated public records on certificates that they have issued, on the specific version of products/systems they certified including information on the validity of the certificates. Introducing and possibly requiring an additional certification related to privacy may be cumbersome especially for SMEs. Under the lead of the European Commission, standardization bodies, and responsible stakeholders should work together to develop best practices and standards combining the requirements for security and data protection in order avoid duplication of work for the two certification areas. There is a well-established legislation regarding accreditation and certification in the MSs. When considering introducing certification for other purposes, i.e. for privacy/data protection, the European Commission together with national policy makers should link such initiatives with existing national accreditation structures.  Companies should not be able to get certificates without really having implemented the processes and controls that have been written down in the audited documents.  The national policy makers should ensure enforcement of such requirements for genuine compliance for instance by applying sanctions and/or ad-hoc assessments carried on by third parties.   For the full report: Security certification practice in the EU - Information Security Management Systems - A case study       Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

Legal and technical barriers as well as lack of interest from cybersecurity stakeholders regarding the sharing of information represent the  key problems for the effective exchange of information. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht commented: “The increasing complexity of cyber-attacks requires more effective cross-border information sharing among Computer Emergency Response Teams. Effective information sharing saves time and effort in incident response and post-mortem analysis. It also increases synergies and aligns the best practices among the CERTs.” Local detection, accompanied by trusted forms of information exchange, leads to the global prevention of cyber-attacks. It is thus very beneficial for the successful identification and subsequent handling of an incident, if it has already been detected by CERTs sharing this information, and this information is shared. Moreover, much progress has been made recently in establishing national/governmental (n/g) CERTs in Europe to coordinate responses to cyber-attacks. As cyber-attacks are often global, it is crucial that incident responses are coordinated not only within national boundaries, but also on an international level. Therefore, secure and effective exchange of information  concerning such incidents must take place. The report identifies the emerging tools and standards that would help CERTs with the efficient sharing of strategic incident information. ENISA has identified a set of recommendations for the CERT community and other security actors for better data exchange practices: Facilitating adoption, interoperability and enhancing functionalities of Essential Tools for the CERT Community Promoting the stability and continuity of incident feeds, which are often changed without prior notice Promoting the use of standards for data exchange Enhancing the functionality of existing tools regarding: Interoperability Automated incident correlation analysis Improved threat intelligence Advanced analytics and visualisation for massive numbers of incidents   The European Union, including ENISA, helps (n/g) CERTs in the process to facilitate the exchange among them of information on incidents. In 2014, ENISA will actively engage in supporting community driven projects helping CERTs to collaborate more efficiently.

ENISA_NEWS_0847	2013-11-19	NEWS	National-level Risk Assessments practices analysis – a first step towards a practical guide	 ENISA aimed to provide an evidence-based methodology for establishing a National-level Risk Assessment in order to contribute to the wider objective of improving national contingency planning practices (NCPs). This report will help towards rationalising national risk assessments in EU Member States in order to reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities of critical Information and Communication Technology (ICT) services and infrastructures. Based on an analysis of the data gathered the following key findings have been identified: Member States should understand better the underlying cyber threats and risks that they face and the impact to society. Member States are advised to integrate National-level Risk Assessment into the lifecycle of NIS incident management and cooperation plans and procedures. Member States should expand public–private sector dialogue and information sharing. A practical step-by-step guide on how to perform National-level Risk Assessments should be developed, tested and maintained. Such a guide should be piloted by countries at the early stages of preparing their own National-level Risk Assessment programme. ENISA or another international institution would be appropriate bodies to oversee this action. A catalogue of scenarios to help Member States in their National-level Risk Assessments should be established at EU level. Such a catalogue could be based on work already being done at ENISA on the threat landscape and incident reporting. The EU community of practitioners with an interest in cyber National-level Risk Assessments should be established and strengthened as information exchange platform, e.g., within the framework of the European Commission’s NIS Platform. Risk analysis expertise must be shared from other domains that assess complex cross-border risks, such as border security, financial services, aviation or public health for example within the European Commission’s NIS Platform and other activities organised by ENISA.   Full report: National-level Risk Assessments: An Analysis Report     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0853	2013-11-14	NEWS	ISACA and ENISA Release Key Conclusions of Meeting on  Auditing Security Measures in the Electronic Communications Sector	 Global association ISACA and cybersecurity agency ENISA have issued minutes highlighting the key conclusions of a joint workshop that took place at ISACA’s World Congress in Berlin. The workshop addressed cybersecurity challenges for national regulators, telecom operators, ISPs and auditors. The minutes are freely available at www.isaca.org/cyber and the ENISA website. More than 25 organizations from 15 countries attended the event held in conjunction with ISACA’s World Congress: INSIGHTS 2013.  Among the conclusions: Cyber security is not only about malicious cyber threats. Power supply failures and cable breaks are threats that need attention. Security measures should be taken within a single framework, and not split into different frameworks for continuity, privacy, etc. Standards and audits are valuable, but they need to contribute to continuous improvements in security and not stop at certifications and OK stamps. Themed “Auditing Security Measures in the Electronic Communications Sector,” the workshop covered Article 13a in the European Union Framework Directive of the Telecom Reform. This article requires electronic communications service providers to assess risks, take appropriate security measures to prevent security incidents, and report on security incidents to their national regulator. The workshop featured a panel of three key operators, regulators and auditors: Telecom Italia Anacom Portugal KPMG Luxembourg “ENISA co-operates with all relevant stakeholders to develop good practices in the area of security measures for Telecom Providers and ISPs. This workshop with ISACA gave us the opportunity to disseminate our work to a large community of certified cybersecurity experts. Through them we hope to reach all relevant stakeholders and make ENISA’s work known and useful,” said Professor Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA.  The report includes a link to relevant ENISA and ISACA resources, including: ENISA’s Technical Guideline on Security Measures and Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting ISACA’s cybersecurity research, including an APT study, a guide on responding to targeted cyberattacks and information on how to use COBIT to transform cybersecurity “While modern cyber threats have no boundaries, international cooperation in the area of cybersecurity is more relevant than ever. This workshop provided results towards advancing current practices, while bridging gaps between different fields such as cybersecurity and auditing that many times operate in silos and fail to be effective,” said Dr. Christos K. Dimitriadis, CISA, CISM, CRISC, international vice president of ISACA and Group Head of Security, Compliance and Innovation at INTRALOT.

ENISA_PR_0857	2013-11-04	PR	Top three recommendations for securing your personal data using cryptography, by EU cyber security Agency ENISA in new report	 The report addresses ways to protect sensitive and/or personal data that has been acquired legitimately. The clear link between privacy and cryptography is underlined, demonstrating how the latter can play a role in protecting personal data and safeguarding legitimately collected sensitive or confidential data. The report presents a mapping of security requirements for personal data and basic cryptographic techniques. It is noteworthy that information security measures and mechanisms can be deployed for the protection of personal data. However, information security does not cover all the issues regarding personal data protection and privacy. Indeed, personal/sensitive data requires different protection measures in different stages of the lifecycle. Therefore, the report presents a short version of such a lifecycle description. The report also identifies security measures and an introduction to basic cryptographic techniques. The report is complemented with a set of technical recommendations for algorithms, key sizes, parameters and protocols. The target audiences of these recommendations are system developers and maintenance engineers in commercial environments who are faced with the need to deploy or replace protective measures for data. Amongst the top three findings and recommendations are: The cryptographic measures are only one piece of a puzzle when referring to privacy and data protection. However, cryptographic measures can provide an important layer of protection for data protection, which may reduce the impact of breaches. The relevant stakeholders (Data Protection Authorities, EU Member States authorities, and service providers) should recommend users and others to implement security measures for protecting personal data, as well as should rely on state-of-the-art solutions and configurations for this purpose. All these stakeholders could use the technical cryptographic measures and recommendations proposed in another recent ENISA study, addressed to decision makers and specialists as a reference. Specialised personnel are needed for the correct implementation of updated cryptographic protective measures. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht commented: “Cryptography is an ancient way to secure data, which still is valid today to protect personal data online.”   For the full reports: Recommended cryptographic measures - Securing personal data & Algorithms, Key Sizes and Parameters Report Background: Commission Regulation No 611/2013on the measures applicable to the notification of personal data breaches under Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy and electronic communications For interviews: Ulf Bergström, Spokesman, E-mail: ulf.bergstrom[at]enisa.europa.eu, mobile: + 30 6948 460 143, or Rodica Tirtea/Stefan Schiffner, Expert, sta[at]enisa.europa.eu       Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0868	2013-10-10	NEWS	Visit by the Swedish National Regulatory Agency PTS to ENISA.	 The objective of the meeting was to exchange experiences and discuss technical topics. For ENISA, PTS is the main Swedish contact and liaison point to other Swedish authorities and is one of our partners in our work on Article 13a and cyber exercises.   More in detail, the meeting focussed on the overlap between Article 13a of the Framework directive, Article 4 of the e-Privacy Directive, and Article 15 of the proposed e-trust/e-sig directive. All these articles are set up similarly. They follow a triangle of risk assessment, appropriate security measures, and incident reporting. In Sweden, PTS is responsible for all three articles.   Moreover the meeting gave the opportunity to discuss and exchange experiences on public-private partnerships for information security, information exchange platforms, risk assessment methods, EU and national cyber security exercises and the role of the e-communications sector in these exercises.   About PTS: http://www.pts.se/en-GB/About-PTS/   Also: Today, the new video re reporting of major cyber security incidents, Art13a was launched.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0869	2013-10-10	NEWS	Video on major cyber incident reporting in the electronic communications sector; (Article 13a Expert Group)	 Obligations on service providers Since 2009, the EU legislation (Article 13a in the Framework Directive of the Telecom Reform) asks EU countries to ensure that the electronic communications service providers are taking the right steps to protect the networks and services from incidents. Article 13a also obliges providers to report significant outages to government authorities, and in turn, asks government authorities to share these reports with the European Commission and ENISA. In 2010, ENISA set up an expert group of experts from EU Member States (from regulators and ministries) to discuss and agree on how to implement Article 13a. The discussions focus, for example, on how to collect incident reports, and how to supervise that providers take appropriate security measures. In these meetings experts also discuss how to mitigate incidents and impact from incidents; for example by discussing frequent root causes, such as storms, human errors or malicious actions.  New video To highlight the importance of incident reporting and to explain how the Article 13a Expert Group works, we have made a 5 minute video, containing interviews with ENISA experts and some of the key stakeholders. Go and check it out at: Reporting of cybersecurity incidents video clip   Background: The work on Article 13a is especially important as a pilot for security legislation in other sectors. One of the pillars of the EU’s cyber security strategy  is to extend Article 13a  to cover also other sectors. More information about the Article 13a expert group can be found at: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Every year ENISA also publishes an annual report about the impact and causes of major outages in the electronic communications sector.

ENISA_PR_0870	2013-10-09	PR	Cyber Security: ENISA White Paper: Can we learn from Industrial Control Systems/SCADA security incidents?	 Increasing numbers of recent security incidents against industrial control systems/SCADA raise questions about the ability of many organisations to respond to critical incidents, as well as about their analytical capabilities. A proactive learning environment through ex-post analysis incidents is therefore key, the Agency underlines. ICS are widely used to control industrial processes for manufacturing, production and distribution of products. Often commercial, outdated off-the-shelf software is used. Well-known types of ICS include supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), where SCADA systems are the largest ICS subgroup. Recent ICS/SCADA incidents underline the importance of good governance and control of SCADA infrastructures. In particular, the ability to respond to critical incidents, as well as the capacity to analyse the results of an attack in order to learn from such incidents is crucial, the Agency underlines. The goal of an ex-post incident analysis is to obtain in-depth-knowledge regarding the incident. This gives you the ability to: rely on robust evidence in order to respond to the changing nature of domestic and alien threats; ensure that enough learning takes place in order to deploy resilient systems. We identified four key points for a proactive learning environment which will in turn ensure a fast response to cyber incidents and their ex-post analysis: Complementing the existing skills base with ex-post analysis expertise and understanding overlaps between cyber and physical critical incident response teams; Facilitating the integration of cyber and physical response processes with a greater understanding of where digital evidence may be found and what the appropriate actions to preserve it would be; Designing and configuring systems in a way that enables digital evidence retention; and Increasing inter-organisational and interstate collaboration efforts.   The Executive Director of ENISA Professor Udo Helmbrecht commented: “SCADA systems are often embedded in sectors that are part of a nation’s critical infrastructure, for example power distribution and transportation control, which makes them an increasingly attractive potential target for cyber attacks, ranging from disgruntled insiders and dissident groups, to foreign states. Such systems should be operated in a manner which allows for the collection and analysis of digital evidence to identify what happened during a security breach.” For full report and recommendations; https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada-industrial-control-systems/can-we-learn-from-scada-security-incidents Background: http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security For interviews; Ulf Bergström, Spokesman, Mobile: ulf.bergstrom[at]enisa.europa.eu, mobile: + 30 6948 460 143, or Adrian Pauna, Expert, resilience[at]enisa.europa.eu     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0877	2013-09-19	PR	Interim report: Top Cyber Threats - smarter targeted attacks, mobile threats, and social media identity thefts by cyber-criminals using Cloud services.	 Some key trends identified in the study are: Cyber-criminals increasingly using advanced methods to implement attack techniques (vectors) that are non-traceable and difficult to take down. Anonymisation technologies and peer-to peer systems (so called distributed technologies) play an important role in this.  It is clear that mobile technology is increasingly exploited by cyber-criminals. Threats of all kinds that were encountered in the more traditional arena of IT will affect mobile devices and the services available on these platforms. The wide spread of mobile devices leads to an amplification of abuse based on knowledge/attack methods targeting social media. The availability of malware and cyber-hacking tools and services, together with digital currencies (e.g. Bitcoins) and anonymous payment services is opening up new avenues for cyber-fraud and criminal activity. There is a real possibility of large impact events when attacks combining various threats are successfully launched. As reported by ENISA in its report on major cyber attacks (2013/07/20), cyber-attack is the sixth most important cause of outages in telecommunication infrastructures, and it impacts upon a considerable number of users. Taking into account these incidents, and denial of service threat developments, we observe an increase in infrastructure threats in 2013.   The study identifies the following top threats with major impact since 2012. Drive-by-exploits: browser-based attacks still remain the most reported threats, and Java remains the most exploited software for this kind of threat. Code Injection: attacks are notably popular against web site Content Management Systems (CMSs). Due to their wide use, popular CMSs constitute a considerable attack surface that has drawn the attention of cyber-criminals. Cloud service provider networks are increasingly used to host tools for automated attacks. Botnets, Denial of Services, Rogueware/Scareware, Targeted Attack, Identity Theft and Search Engine Poisoning are the other trending threats. A full ENISA Threat Landscape 2013 report is due by the end of the year. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht commented: “This short, interim report informs security stakeholders as early as possible about developments in cyber threats, so that they are able to take countermeasures”.

ENISA_NEWS_0881	2013-08-28	NEWS	ENISA at the TREsPASS project	 Mixing the security potion The TREsPASS project is a cross sector scientific project, mixing technical knowledge, (how vulnerable are protocols and software),  with social sciences (e.g. how likely are people to succumb to social engineering), and state-of-the-art industry processes and tools. The objective is to predict, prioritise, and prevent complex attacks in a systematic way.   The TREsPASS project will make this possible, by building an “attack navigator”. This navigator makes it possible to say which attack opportunities are possible, which of them are the most urgent, and which countermeasures are most effective.   By harnessing European expertise on socio-technical security a widely applicable and standardised framework, will be produced. Ultimately, TREsPASS will reduce security incidents in Europe, as it will allow business, SMEs, organisations and their customers to make informed decisions about security investments, which is vital for the society, resilience and economy of Europe. The TREsPASS project is funded by the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme.   For more information: http://www.trespass-project.eu/     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0884	2013-08-20	PR	New major incidents in 2012 report by EU cyber security agency ENISA	 The Annual Incident Reports 2012 publication covers the year’s major security incidents in the EU. It provides an aggregated analysis of the 79 reported incidents of severe outages of electronic communication networks, or services. Key conclusions include: 18 countries reported 79 significant incidents, nine countries reported no significant incidents. Most incidents affected mobile telephony or mobile internet (about 50%). Incidents affecting mobile telephony or mobile internet also affected most users (around 1,8 million users per incident). This is consistent with the high penetration rate of mobile telephony and mobile internet in the EU. Incidents caused by overload followed by power failures respectively had most impact in terms of number of users affected times duration. For most incident reports, as well as for the four services, (fixed and mobile telephony, and fixed and mobile internet) the root cause was “System failures” (75 %). Hardware failures were the most common cause of “Systems failures”, followed by software bugs. Switches were the most frequent point of failure (e.g. routers and local exchange points) followed by mobile network home location registers. Root cause third party failure incidents, mostly power supply failures, affected around 2.8 million user connections per incident on average. Incidents involving overload affected around 9.4 million user connections per incident on average. Incidents caused by natural phenomena (mainly storms and heavy snowfall) lasted the longest: on average around 36 hours.   Anonymized examples of the incidents reported range from: Overload causing VoIP outage Faulty upgrade halting IP-based traffic Cable theft causing fibre optic cable break Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Domain Name System (DNS) affecting mobile internet Faulty software update affecting mobile telephony   The Executive Director of ENISA Professor Udo Helmbrecht commented: “The EU collaboration behind this report is key to improving the security and resilience of electronic communications networks in the EU, as well as for security in other critical sectors. Reporting major incidents helps us understand what went wrong, why, and how to prevent similar incidents from happening again. ENISA, with all National Reporting Authorities across the EU, will continue delivering practical lessons learned, that could significantly improve the security of our telecommunication infrastructure.” The next annual (2013) report will be published in spring, 2014.

ENISA_NEWS_0892	2013-07-04	NEWS	Survey and review launched for the ENISA Cloud Security Guide for SMEs 	" Today, 4th July, the steering board of the European Cloud Partnership will be meeting in Talinn. The European Cloud Partnership (ECP) is one of the key actions under the EU cloud strategy (launched by the European Commission in 2012) – subtitled  ”Unleashing the Potential of Cloud Computing in Europe”. The partnership brings together experts from industry and public sector and aims to improve public procurement of cloud services in Europe, by establishing common definitions of requirements, possibly going as far as joint procurement across borders. This should make the public sector more effective, i.e. save money and do more with less, while it would also stimulate a European cloud industry. ENISA's role ENISA, the EU Network and Information Security Agency, is working closely with the European Commission and the members of the European Cloud Partnership (ECP), providing technical advice about cloud computing security and resilience. Network and information security plays an important role in the adoption of cloud computing. One the one hand, some of the key benefits of cloud computing are security-benefits (safer software, higher availability, etc). On the other hand, numerous surveys and polls show that security concerns (governance, security measures, data protection requirements) are the key issues for customers – sometimes acting as a barrier to adoption. Cloud partnership At the meeting in Talinn, members of the cloud partnership will present a number of flagship projects. One of the ECP flagship projects initiated by F-Secure is to develop a procurement guide for SMEs – focussing on security and resilience issues. F-Secure has asked ENISA to leverage its expertise and experience to develop a brief and practical guide. As a first milestone of this flagship project today ENISA will launch the review of the first half of the guide, which focusses on security opportunities and risks. Experts from the ECP and experts from ENISA’s cloud security and resilience working group will be invited to provide feedback and input about what are the security opportunities and what are the main security risks for SMEs.   ENISA's Dr Marnix Dekker commented; ""We would like to thank F-Secure, for initiating this flagship project, for involving us and we look forward to delivering quickly a high-quality result. We see this as a first step towards a long-term working relation between ENISA and the ECP, allowing us to provide expert advise on security and resilience topics, to the partnership.""   Background: Already back in 2009 ENISA started to develop guidance and recommendations on cloud computing security. The ENISA papers on cloud computing are widely quoted and used. They are perhaps best-known for the positive message underlining the security opportunities in cloud computing. We see cloud computing as a way to improve the level of security and resilience of IT, across the EU – also from a Critical Information Infrastructure Protection -CIIP- perspective for example. ENISA now works with a select group of security experts from providers, academia, public sector and industry, to understand issues and validate analyses and recommendations. The group meets several times per year (over the phone and face-to-face) to discuss cloud security topics. To give an example of the topics under discussion, ENISA is trying to understand how (in practical terms) incident reporting to authorities could be implemented, what would be an efficient framework and how to provide added-value to the industry. The expert group acts as the backbone for the work of ENISA in this area.   Stay in contact!

We will be working more closely with Member States and putting an increased focus on cybercrime, working with Europol.  “To reach this very positive conclusion, we have had a great deal of support, from Member States, European Parliamentarians, the European Council, the Commission and individual Commissioners. In particular, the support of MEPs Giles Chichester and Christian Ehler, and Commission Vice-President, Neelie Kroes was essential.  Our ENISA staff, Management Board, Permanent Stakeholders Group and National Liaison Officers have also supported us throughout the process. I thank them all. We are now working to secure the resources we need to deliver on the important security tasks that Europe’s citizens have entrusted to us.” The new Regulation enshrines ENISA’s achievements in areas such as Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) in Member States, and its world-class cybersecurity exercises, such as Cyber Europe 2012, with 600 participants from across Europe. Other key points of the new Regulation include: Providing ENISA with a strong interface with the fight against cybercrime - focusing on prevention and detection - with Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) ENISA supporting the development of EU cybersecurity policy and legislation The Agency supporting research, development and standardisation, with EU standards for risk management and the security of electronic products, networks and services ENISA supporting the prevention and detection of, and response to cross-border cyber-threats Aligning ENISA more closely to the EU Regulatory process, providing EU countries and Institutions with assistance and advice The Regulation also confirms that the Agency’s seat (its headquarters), will remain in Heraklion, on Crete, with an operational office in Athens. The EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy, and Directive, published in February, also foresee a key role for ENISA in protecting Europe’s cyberspace. Note:[i] The ENISA Regulation was approved by the Council of the European Union on 14th May 2013, following it being passed by the European Parliament on 15th April, with an overwhelming majority: 626 votes in favour, of the 687 votes cast, with 45 against and 16 abstentions.  The Regulation was signed by the European Parliament and Council of the European Union on 21st May 2013.   ENISA was established in 2004, under Regulation (EC) No 460/2004, with a five year mandate. This mandate was subsequently extended, in 2008 and 2011, to allow time for the new Regulation to be developed.      Background information: To see the new ENISA Regulation in full, go to: Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 European Parliament press statement on 15th April ENISA Regulation vote.

ENISA_NEWS_0907	2013-06-06	NEWS	Future Internet gets boost, courtesy of IPv6!	 The Internet Protocol (IP) is used by all computers and other IT devices that are connected to the Internet, and the increased usage of the latest version, IPv6 allows for its continued growth. This is the third consecutive year in which IPv6 use has doubled. If current trends continue, more than half of Internet users around the world will be IPv6-connected in less than 6 years. IPv6 is the successor to the Internet Protocol, IPv4, which was running out of room for new addresses. IPv6 offers many technological advantages, which are likely to have a significant impact in network security and online business development.  IPv6 will be a key driver for many new mobile and wireless applications and services, and  is an essential technology for implementing ambient intelligence or the ‘Internet of Things’ that enables electronic devices to communicate with each other. ENISA is a long standing advocate of IPv6 . In 2009, ENISA became the first EU Agency to roll out IPv6. View the infographic about how the world has changed since World IPv6 Launch began.

ENISA_NEWS_0917	2013-05-17	NEWS	ENISA - celebrating Europe with Heraklion 	" ENISA is now in its eighth year on Crete, and to mark its recent achievements as the European Union’s expert cybersecurity body, it will be running fun competitions for children, with special Europe-themed prizes. ENISA's key role in protecting Europe’s cybersecurity was highlighted in April, when the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of giving the Agency a new seven-year mandate, and confirmed that the agency’s seat will continue to be in Heraklion[i]. The Agency also received an extended set of responsibilities, including helping to protect Europe's key systems, such as electricity networks. The European Union's Cyber Security Strategy, published in February, also identifies key roles for ENISA, with proposals including the launch of a European Network and Information Security (NIS) ""driving licence"" to promote core cybersecurity skills. This, says the Agency, could bring IT-related development opportunities to Crete. These could include specialist training, with the possibility of using facilities in the Agency’s new offices, when these are completed. (The construction of the new facilities is currently running two years behind schedule – completion was planned in 2011, and is now not expected until the end of 2013). Head of Public Affairs, Graeme Cooper comments, ""It is planned for ENISA to move into a new, purpose-built headquarters in Heraklion. While not yet completed, the building has been funded entirely with €7,7 million of European Commission development funding  under the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) 7 programme. ENISA is exploring ways in which we could help to make maximum use of these facilities - for example in developing specialist IT security training, based here on Crete.” Such an initiative would build on the Agency’s expertise and recent successes, which include: Facilitating Europe’s biggest ever cyber security exercise – Cyber Europe 2012 Supporting “front line” computer emergency response teams across all of Europe’s 27 Member States Establishing Europe’s first ever reporting scheme for large-scale cyber security incidents Setting up an operational office in Athens More information on ENISA and its work to protect Europe’s cyberspace will be available at the Europe Day event on Saturday.

At a speech in Paris in 1950, the French foreign minister, Robert Schuman, set out his idea for a new form of political cooperation in Europe, which would make war between Europe’s nations unthinkable. His vision was to create a European institution that would pool and manage coal and steel production. A treaty creating such a body was signed just under a year later. Schuman’s proposal is considered to be the beginning of what is now the European Union.

ENISA_PR_0925	2013-04-12	PR	EU Agency ENISA: Internet Service Providers fail to apply filters against big cyber attacks	 This error is as a key factor behind the failure to counter major cyber-attacks, the Agency underlines in its information Flash Note, ‘Can Recent Cyber Attacks Really Threaten Internet Availability?’ The Flash Note focuses on the large-scale cyber-attack that was mounted in March against the Non-Profit Organisation Spamhaus, which is based in Geneva and London. The digital assault caused noticeable delays for internet users, primarily in the UK, Germany and other parts of Western Europe. According to online media, the attack on Spamhaus, starting on 16th March, was the biggest Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack in internet history. DDoS attacks work by “overloading” a site’s ability to cope with incoming traffic. The attack on Spamhaus lasted more than one week. In its final phase, the enormous amount of traffic generated caused problems at the London Internet Exchange. ENISA underlines that the technique used for the DDoS attack is by no means new. Yet, even today, many network providers do not use a set of recommendations, known as Best Current Practice 38 (BCP38), which have been around for almost 13 years. A similar set of recommendations for DNS server operators (BCP140, published in 2008) would have reduced the number of servers that can be misused for DNS amplification attacks. If these recommendations had been implemented by all operators, traffic filtering would block such attacks. There are, says ENISA, a number of lessons that can be learned from the attack, including: Attacks are increasing in size. The March 2013 attack on Spamhaus reached a size of more than 300 Gigabits of data per second while the biggest reported DDoS attack in 2012 was at 100 Gigabits of data per second. Size matters. At this size of attack, even commercial internet exchange points, which normally have very high capacity infrastructure, can be compromised. The Agency makes three technical recommendations: Relevant service operators should implement BCP38 Operators of DNS servers should check whether their servers can be misused, and should implement BCP 140 Internet exchange point operators should ensure they are protected against direct attacks. ENISA’s Executive Director, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, stated: “Network Operators that have yet to implement BCP38 and BCP140 should seriously consider doing so without delay, failing which their customers, and hence their reputations, will suffer. Prevention is key to effectively countering cyber-attacks. We therefore welcome the EU’s Cyber Security Strategy, which is proposing a strengthened role for ENISA, with adequate resources, to help protect Europe’s digital society and economy.” For full ENISA Flash Note Background: EU’s Cybersecurity strategy For interviews: Ulf Bergstrom, Spokesman, press@enisa.europa.eu, or mobile: +30 6948 460 143, or Dr. Louis Marinos, louis.marinos@enisa.europa.eu Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0926	2013-04-11	NEWS	ENISA's new corporate 2013 video clip launched	" ENISA has launched its new corporate video clip. This six-minutes movie describes the role of ENISA in a world where ""everything is connected"" both privately and professionally. Communication technology  connects us to family, friends, banks, and other private and e-government services we all rely on. But the Internet is under constant threat, from crime, attacks and accidents. Spamhaus, Stuxnet, Flamer, High Roller  to name a few of the sophisticated cyber-attacks that took place the last 3 years. It is the European Union Agency ENISA’s job to work with prevention at EU levels in the field of cyber security. ENISA is working with governments, regulators and industry to assess risks and identify practical solutions to keep business, citizens and economy secure. This way, we support the smooth functioning of Europe’s internal market. The need for governments to have fast and effective responses to cyber-attacks is demonstrated by recent  attacks on government web sites and, in the US, attempts to extract information on critical infrastructure,  such as electricity distribution  grids. ENISA supports the Computer Emergency Response Teams, CERTs, set up by governments and organisations to defend against cyber threats, with training, coordination, and advice on good practices and information sharing. For ENISA, providing support for Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) is a priority.  The Agency organises Cyber-security exercises (e.g. Cyber Europe 2012),  to build Pan-European and international cooperation for large-scale cyber security incidents amongst a variety of other actions. 6 minutes - for your safety! The Internet and new technologies offer massive opportunities for Europe’s citizens and economy. The cyber and everyday worlds now merge seamlessly to give us the information and services we expect and need as digital citizens, but we need to focus on prevention and on designing better, more secure systems.""

ENISA_PR_0934	2013-03-13	PR	Urgent action is needed in order to combat emerging cyber-attack trends	 The latest targeted cyber-attacks on government organizations and high-profile companies show the need for greater awareness and knowhow in network and information security, says the EU’s European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA). The Agency urges Europe’s businesses and government organisations to take urgent action to address cyber-attacks. It highlights several issues such as cyber space’s lack of borders, failing security measures and the security issues of email. It also makes several recommendations, for instance to focus more on prevention and to look at more secure communication solutions. Commenting on the latest wave of cyber attacks, ENISA’s Executive Director, Professor Udo Helmbrecht said:  “Well known cyber-attack methods, such as spear-phishing, are still very effective. However, much can be done to counter these attacks - by making users aware of traps, and by ensuring that better security measures are in place. “In cyberspace, it is difficult to be sure where attacks originate, so the focus should be on preventing and mitigating attacks, regardless of where the attackers are based.”   As well as the cyber-attack Flash Note, ENISA’s other recent publications include a comprehensive overview of the current cyber security risk landscape.

ENISA_PR_0942	2013-02-14	PR	New ENISA report: The double-edged sword of Cloud computing in Critical Information Infrastructure Protection	" In a few years, a large majority of organisations will be dependent on Cloud computing. Large Cloud services will have tens of millions of end-users. What happens if one of these cloud services fails, or gets hacked? “From a security perspective, the concentration of data is a ‘double-edged sword’; large providers can offer state-of-the-art security, and business continuity, spreading the costs across many customers. But if an outage or security breach occurs, the impact is bigger, affecting many organisations and citizens at once,” Dr Marnix Dekker says.  Last years, there have been many examples of failures affecting very large sites with millions of users (for example, the leap year bug outage). This report looks at the threats from a CIIP perspective, i.e. how to prevent large cyber disruptions and large cyber-attacks. The key messages of the report are: Critical infrastructure: Soon, the vast majority of organisations will use cloud computing notably also in critical sectors like finance, energy and transport. Cloud services are themselves becoming a critical information infrastructure. Natural disasters and DDoS attacks: A benefit of Cloud computing is resilience in the face of natural disasters and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)-attacks, which are difficult to mitigate using traditional approaches (servers on site, or single data centre). Cyber attacks: Cyber attacks exploiting software flaws can cause large data breaches, affecting millions of users, because of the large concentration of users and data. Physical redundancy does not safeguard against certain cyber attacks, such as data breaches exploiting software flaws.   The report also provides nine recommendations for bodies responsible for critical information infrastructures. Key points: Include large cloud services in national risk assessments, track cloud dependencies, and work with providers on incident reporting schemes. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, commented: ""Cloud computing is a reality and therefore we must prepare to prevent service failures and cyber attacks on cloud services. The European Cyber Security and Cloud Computing Strategies provide a roadmap for this."" ENISA will launch a new working group focussing on CIIP and governmental Cloud security.   For full report and recommendations https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cloud-computing/critical-cloud-computing/ Background:Commission’s CIIP action plan , European Commission Cloud Computing Strategy, EU Cybersecurity Strategy For interviews; Ulf Bergstrom, Spokesman, press@enisa.europa.eu, mobile: +30 6948 460 143, or Dr Marnix Dekker, ENISA Expert, resilience@enisa.europa.eu Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0949	2013-01-31	PR	Largest cyber security exercise “Cyber Europe 2012’’ report published in 23 languages	 The scope, scale and complexity of “Cyber Europe 2012” in figures: Twenty-nine EU (European Union) and EFTA (European Free Trade Association) Member States were involved in the exercise; twenty-five as active players and four as observers. In addition, several EU-Institutions also participated. Overall, 339 organisations took part, totalling 571 individual players being exposed to thousands of incidents (‘injects’). They included: cyber-security agencies and organisations, relevant ministries, e-government services, financial institutions (60), Internet Service Providers (ISPs) (60), and telecommunication operators. The majority (88%) of the exercise players rated it positively. Cyber Europe 2012 attracted considerable global media attention; more than 600 articles were published in 19 languages. Key Findings (excerpts)  Knowledge of procedures and information flows is crucial for fast and effective response Frequent cooperation and information exchange between public and private players is necessary Public–private cooperation structures differ among countries. Parallel, and sometimes overlapping, public and private procedures on the national level thus challenged national level cooperation Countries faced challenges in crisis management decision making, although this was not included in the exercise objectives (e.g., decisions have to be taken at more strategic levels) Scalability of operational procedures was a challenge, due to the large number of countries Up-to-date technical infrastructures and tools were critical for effective cooperation Efficient planning is crucial for conducting large-scale exercises Key recommendations More pan-European and national cyber exercises are necessary to improve cross country cyber crisis cooperation, which the ENISA Good Practice Guide on National Exercises supports. EU Member States and EFTA countries should improve the effectiveness, scalability, and knowledge of existing mechanisms, procedures and information flows for both national and international cooperation More training in crisis procedures is necessary for all cyber-crisis stakeholders Increased private sector involvement at the national level should be considered for future exercises Input from other European critical sectors (e.g. energy, transportation) is a good next step. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, concluded: “Cyber Europe 2012 was an important milestone to build trust, to better understand the existing European cyber cooperation mechanisms, and to strengthen Europe’s cyber-incident management” For full report in all 23 EU official languages : Cyber Europe 2012 - Key findings report Background: The first Cyber Europe exercise in 2010,COM/2009/149, Digital Agenda for Europe, and COM/2011/163.

European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes (responsible for ENISA and cybersecurity) commented: ""A political agreement on the renewed mandate of ENISA was reached this evening at the third trialogue that took place in the European Parliament. This is a timely development, particularly in light of the Cyber Security Strategy and legislative proposal on network and information security which will be adopted by the Commission shortly."" The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht added: “On behalf of all at ENISA, I would like to thank everyone involved in this successful conclusion to the trialogue. We welcome these positive signals and this increased focus on cyber security. We will follow the further final steps of the legislative process with keen interest. Assuming that this political agreement is adopted, and all goes as foreseen, ENISA will have a stable framework to support robust cyber security in Europe, to the benefit of citizens, businesses and the European economy.” Background: The Commission is planning to adopt an EU Cybersecurity Strategy and related directive on 7 February ENISA's mandate will be for 7 years from the official publication of the agreement.    Full Irish Presidency news text Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0954	2013-01-25	NEWS	Davos: Commissioner and VP Kroes; speech on the forthcoming Cybersecurity Strategy for the EU -mentions ENISA	 Commissioner Kroes underlined e.g. that “cybersecurity is a matter that cannot be left to the technical people. It is a matter for board levels. But we also need to transform the risk story into a growth story.  The big opportunities of the digital economy will not be realised if people are worried about security and do not trust networks and systems.” The Cybersecurity Strategy for the EU is planned to be presented soon and will focus on the need to improve the overall resilience of network and information systems, including by stimulating the competitiveness of the ICT industry, as well as user demand for security functionalities in ICT products and services. To strengthen cyber resilience and network and information security, the Strategy will be accompanied by a proposal for a Directive on Network and Information Security (NIS) across the EU, to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market. In the speech, Commissioner Kroes details, among other things; “The proposal requires the Member States to be appropriately equipped. The Member States' NIS competent authorities would also be required to cooperate with each other at EU level. The European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) is to support this process by providing its technical expertise and advice.” and “The Commission will also propose to extend the obligations to adopt NIS risk management measures and to report significant incidents to national authorities, to new sectors which are vital for our economy and society (energy, transport, banking, healthcare, key Internet companies).” Finally, Commissioner Kroes concludes that “cybersecurity is too important to be left to the goodwill of companies.” For full speech.

ENISA_NEWS_0960	2013-01-07	NEWS	Security is key for BYOD 	 ENISA’s new report, Consumerization of IT: Risk Mitigation Strategies and Good Practices looks at the latest developments, and delivers six key messages to help ensure that “bring your own device” doesn’t also bring unforeseen risks.  Aimed at Chief Information Officers, Chief Executives and others who take IT security decisions, the report’s messages are: 1. Ensure that governance aspects are derived from business processes and protection requirements, and are defined before dealing with technology. 2. End-user involvement can effectively mitigate risks. Awareness-raising on COIT programmes is highly effective for the enforcement of security policies. 3. Periodic risk assessment on COIT programmes should be undertaken to ensure that security policies remain compatible with evolving technologies. 4. Keep in mind that encryption complements but does not replace strategic risk management within a COIT programme. 5. Perform small steps initially and proceed with more complex policies when sufficient experience has been gained. 6. It is important to identify which COIT risks need to be mitigated within your organisation while the window of opportunity till remains open The report builds on ENISA’s October 2012 publication, Consumerization of IT: Top Risks and Opportunities, and was produced by ENISA with input and comments from a group of experts from industry, academia and public sector organisations.    For the full report: Consumerization of IT: Risk Mitigation Strategies and Good Practices Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0963	2012-12-19	PR	New report on Smart Grids cyber security measures; a risk-based approach is key to secure implementation, according to EU Agency ENISA	 In contrast to the US’ strict regulatory path, the European approach is to allow a certain degree of ‘freedom’, where these guidelines above can be tailored and combined for the needs of different actors, given the varied market. The Agency therefore proposes a scalability of around 40 (39) security measures which are organised into three levels of sophistication and ten (10) domains:   Security governance & risk management; Third parties management; Secure lifecycle process for smart grid components/systems and operating procedures; Personnel security, awareness and training; Incident response & information sharing; Audit and accountability; Continuity of operations; Physical security; Information systems security; and Network security.   The adoption of a minimum set of security measures needs the consensus and cooperation of various smart grid stakeholders. A coordination initiative could allow a common and generally accepted approach to smart grid security issues. Moreover, a common cyber security approach would help both regulators and stakeholders by harmonising the complex smart grid’s environment and bproviding incentives to improve cyber security. This report can therefore assist the EU by: Aligning the varying levels of security and resilience of the market operators with a consistent minimum national framework; Providing an indication of minimum levels of security and resilience in the Member States with regards to the smart grids Ensuring minimum levels on requirements for smart grids across Member States, thus reducing compliance and operational costs; Setting the baseline for a minimum auditable control framework across Europe; Facilitating preparedness, recovery, response measures and mutual aid of operators during crisis; Contributing to achieve an adequate level of transparency in the internal market.   The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, commented; “In order to reach the ambitious EU2020 objectives: 20% of renewable energy, 20% of CO2 emissions reduction and 20% increase in energy efficiency, it is a key issue to ensure that the roll-out of smart grids for distributed energy generation into future electricity grid is done in a secure way. Both innovative technical solutions are required, along with new suitable EU regulatory and economic schemes. We hope to see smart grids in the forthcoming Cyber Security Strategy of the EU.”   For full report For interviews; Ulf Bergstrom, Spokesman, press@enisa.europa.eu, +30 6948 460 143, or Dr Konstantinos Moulinos, resilience@enisa.europa.eu Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0965	2012-12-18	NEWS	Report looks at improving emergency communications	 This report ENISA looks at how the technology and processes used in emergency response could be improved, with the aim of providing guidance to policymakers in EU Member States and EU organisations. For the report, interviews were conducted with a range of people working directly in crisis response, as well as representatives from regulatory areas and service provision. The aim was to identify good practices and highlight potential gaps and barriers to effective crisis communications.  In post-crisis reviews of major incidents, inter-agency communications are often identified as a problem. The report highlights a range of issues that can contribute to difficulties, and which, if corrected, could make emergency communications far more effective. Issues include the development of different communications standards and practices between, for example, police and ambulance services, and technology failure in crisis situations.

ENISA_PR_0966	2012-12-17	PR	In focus: Status report 2012 on Computer Emergency Response Teams baseline capabilities launched by EU Agency ENISA	 The need for a functional network of n/g CERTs in Europe by the end of 2012 was established in several EU documents (Digital Agenda for Europe/EU’s Internal Security Strategy/the CIIP Communication). The Status Report 2012 states that the key obstacle to cross-border cooperation and incident response is the diversity of capabilities across Member States. Some teams do not have an ‘adequate level of maturity’ compared with the teams in other Member States. Four baseline capabilities constitute the focus of the report:  Excerpts of key findings for n/g CERTs; 1. Mandate & strategy: -Most n/g CERTs have a clear role and mandate, yet the details and form vary greatly across the EU. -A great deal of work needs to be done regarding the proper inclusion of n/g CERTs in national cyber-security strategies; presently, less than 50% of the Member States have such strategies.  2. Service portfolio: The scope of support depends on the type of constituent: key constituents (e.g. governmental bodies) receive the complete service portfolio. The valuable cyber security expertise of n/g CERTs is also highly sought by law enforcement agencies and other stakeholders. 3. Operational capability: More than 80% employ 6–8 full-time staff, which is the minimum level necessary for acceptable services. However, in smaller teams, staff have multiple roles, which is a barrier to specialisation. In particular, n/g CERTs report difficulties in hiring digital forensics and reverse engineering specialists. 4. Cooperation capability: As large-scale cyber-incidents necessitates both national and international management, n/g CERTs are well anchored in international structures like (FIRST, TF-CSIRT, EGC, Trusted Introducer, APWG or ENISA workshops). The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, stated; “These two reports show that while great progress has been made in Europe recently, more work is necessary to bridge the different maturity levels of CERTs. The identified challenges: questions of clarity of governmental CERT roles and responsibilities, lack of funding and missing resources such as highly specialised IT, legal, and PR experts must be addressed. These challenges need to be resolved by many parties: legislators, CERT teams, cooperation partners and international organisations.” For full reports: Status Report 2012 for CERTs Updated recommendations 2012 For interviews; Ulf Bergstrom, Spokesman, press@enisa.europa.eu, mobile: +30 6948 460 143, or Andrea Dufkova, Expert, opsec@enisa.europa.eu Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0968	2012-12-13	PR	Successful collaborative cyber security awareness raising - Large Scale Pilot for EU SME business & citizens;two new reports launched by EU Agency ENISA on the European Information Sharing and Alert System (EISAS)	 A recent Eurobarometer survey reveals that most EU citizens (59%) feel unprepared to protect their online information. Moreover, cyber security is generally in the hands of specialists who implement technical solutions. Citizens and SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) are left out of this action, despite the fact that end users’ cyber security awareness is ‘the first line of defence’ against cyber threats. The EISAS Large Scale Pilot involved national and governmental Computer Emergency Response Teams, public and private organisations involved in awareness raising in four EU Member States: Germany, Hungary, Poland and Spain as well as Norway. All the pilot participants cooperated in cross-border awareness-raising efforts. This empowered citizens and SMEs with the necessary skills and security knowledge to protect themselves from major cyber threats: Botnets, identity theft and social engineering. The awareness material was translated, adapted and disseminated to target audiences in each Member State. Finally, the pilot reached more than 1700 European citizens and employees with tailored security information, using social media, public websites, and targeted mailing lists as communication channels for targeting EU citizens and SMEs. This pilot demonstrated that the EISAS approach of European collaboration in awareness raising works. The successful pilot results now need to be sustained by a brokering actor. In the pilot, ENISA had this role, but it now has to be transferred to a collaborative community of willing stakeholders. In this regard, the Directorate General for Home Affairs’ NISHA project –Network for Information Sharing and Alerting is a promising candidate for such information brokerage. In 2013, ENISA will support EISAS by running a study to identify the suitable actors and organisation for its full deployment. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, remarked; “No firewall or security policy can efficiently protect users unless they are aware of the risks. Therefore, the EISAS pilot is important for the European citizens and businesses, in particular the SMEs, constituting 98% of the European economy.”   For EISAS Large Scale Pilot Report For EISAS 2012 Roadmap Background documents: 2011 EISAS basic toolset.

ENISA_NEWS_0969	2012-12-12	NEWS	Final report of the 7th CERT workshop, this year jointly arranged by ENISA-Europol on fighting cybercrime	 The 2012 CERT workshop was held at the Europol premises in The Hague, 16-17 October 2012. The focus remained on cooperation between national/governmental CERTs (n/g CERTs) in Europe and their national Law Enforcement counterparts (LEAs). (See earlier news item ) Composition of participants Out of a total number of 44 participants, 15 represented the national/governmental CERT, 12 the national Law Enforcement Agency (usually the high tech crime units). The other participants were experts from Industry as well as from international organisations. Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, United Kingdom were the EU Member States that participated as well as Norway and Switzerland. Workshop focus The focus was on how to increase an exchange of information on cybercrime threats, and the cooperation and collaboration on a practical working level between n/g CERT and LEA communities, both on a national and cross-border level. There is an urgent need for these two communities to collaborate more and better, because of their complementary responsibilities. A mutual cooperation is a win-win situation for both communities, because both CERTs and LEAs can learn from and support each other in the fight against cybercrime. Currently, in many cases this collaboration is very limited and sometimes even non-existent. The workshop aimed to identify these synergies as well as gaps and to practically address these obstacles of cooperation. Practical cooperation After four keynote speeches, three interactive working sessions, in detail presented in the report, followed on: Botnet mitigation, (including e.g. Is botnet mitigation a business case for CERTs?) Capacity building (including e.g. Case studies, Data protection, and Exercises) Workflows and incident response; (including; e.g. Inventory of information sources and how they are managed, Need for a global directory; incompatible priorities, Internet Service Provider’s role, Intelligence and evidence collection, as well as takedown and sink-holing).   For full, detailed workshop report:  7th annual CERT Workshop Report For overview of ENISA CERT activities: CERT Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

Financial Gains of Cyber Security Assessing the cost-effectiveness of CERTs should take into account the beneficial actions that CERTs achieve by contributing to detect, handle, recover from and deter incidents early and efficiently. Thus, security is not usually seen as an investment that provides profit, but rather loss prevention. Security Metrics The FIRST Metrics SIG (Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams) is working to improve the metrics and evaluation methods for internal evaluation of CERTs and address the topic of cost of incidents and return on security investment.

ENISA_NEWS_0972	2012-12-11	NEWS	ENISA to work with Greece’s government on secure e-services for citizens	 The meeting, between Deputy Minister of Administrative Reform and E-Governance, Manousos Voloudakis and ENISA’s Executive Director, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, was held at the Ministry’s Athens offices, on Friday, 7th December, 2012. The workshop was attended by the General Secretary of Information Systems (Ministry of Finance), Mr. Harry Theoharis and representatives of the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Public Order and Citizen Protection, the Ministry of Labour, Social Security and Welfare, the Police Force, the Hellenic Data Protection Authority, the Hellenic Telecommunications & Post Commission, the Informatics Development Agency, the Special Managing Authority of the Operational Programme “Adminstrative Reform”, the “e-Government Center for Social Security” SA and “Information Society” SA. Discussions explored how, as an agency based in Greece and serving the whole of Europe, ENISA can offer its expertise to support the on-going development of electronic government services for Greece’s citizens. In his opening Vice Minister Voloudakis stressed that the introduction of electronic government services that respect the privacy and free will of citizens is among the highest priorities for Greece. In this context, e-Governance is considered as one of the basic conditions for the creation of an effective public administration. At the same time it enables the reduction of bureaucracy and of the overall cost of public administration operations, as well as increasing transparency. Professor Helmbrecht, together with other experts from ENISA, also outlined the Agency’s wider work, describing how ENISA supports initiatives such as Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), secure information infrastructure protection and privacy protection with Member States. Across Europe, e-government is already providing fast, secure and cost-effective services in areas such as: social security and welfare  car and vehicle services education healthcare safety at work public information Professor Helmbrecht said: “E-gov services offer massive potential to enhance people’s lives and, crucially for us all at this time, kick-start economic activity. But whether we’re talking about e-gov or commercial services, information security must be of the highest level. If it is not, the benefits will not be realised. The work already undertaken by Minister Voloudakis and his team is very positive. ENISA will continue to give its support so that Greece’s citizens can benefit from more fast, cost-effective and secure e-gov services, and our press releases also exist in Greek, as to get the message out by Greek media and governmental bodies to the Greek society.” Vice Minister Voloudakis stressed: “The collaboration with ENISA is of essence and concerns the common effort for efficient and secure electronic services. The government’s strategy on e-Governance has set as a high priority to create a Digital Public Administration that will be able to gradually provide more of its services to the citizens online, with the landmark being to have all public services online by the end of 2015. However, I want to stress that this will be achieved with full respect to the privacy and free will of citizens. A key factor in accomplishing this important condition is choosing to deploy an e-identification model that will be optional while securing the citizens’ personal data. That is why we study and carefully evaluate the different deployments in other countries before deciding our approach.”    For agenda and presentations of the Meeting Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_0974	2012-12-10	NEWS	Education-the first step to cyber security ; new report launched ''Collaborative Solutions For Network Information Security in Education''	 The report is a continuation of the ENISA 2011 study ‘Network Information Security in Education: Consolidated ENISA contribution. The Agency advocates that brokerage of information is the basis of the learning cycle. As a proof point, the report provides practical examples with more action-based learning from  Austria, Luxembourg and Denmark and the respondents of the 'Findings from practice' survey. The main recommendation out of this work is that we should all learn from best practices of our peers and share our own experience. Can-do attitude We also recommend that a ‘can do’ attitude’ should be deployed by educators and their students of different age groups. Target Audience This report is aimed at educators, defined as trainers, teachers, peers involved in formal education and non-formal education, including life-long learning. Report outline The report consists of three parts: The results of the survey and consultations, The ENISA recommendations from 2012 deliverables and  Three case studies from Member States (Austria, Luxembourg and Denmark).                                 Why is this important? As Vice President and Commissioner Nellie Kroes stated when referring to digital tools, it is important to realise the huge benefit for economies, societies and democracies that are brought by such digital tools and to participate in the effort to ‘build a connected, competitive continent: an e-EU’.  Moreover, it is crucial to have secure digital communications and networks for the information society to function. It is ultimately a wallet issue for citizens, companies and the entire society. Education-the first step to cyber security Finally, in the report, we recommend to start with digital education as a first step for understanding Network and Information Security (NIS).

ENISA_NEWS_0975	2012-12-07	NEWS	New Roadmap for Computer Emergency Response (CERT) Training	 The Roadmap focuses on finding solutions for how more proactive and efficient Computer Emergency Response (CERT) Training could be provided in Europe.Options and inputs from CERTs and other stakeholders were examined from different perspectives. During this work subject matter specialists shared their ideas, forming together a valuable and practical roadmap. Until 2012, ENISA’s work on the training of CERTs focused mainly on supporting the Training of Network Security Incident Teams Staff (TRANSITS) framework, organising various workshops and providing ENISA CERT exercise material. While these efforts were widely used and appreciated by the CERTs and other communities, the challenges and circumstances have now changed. Since ENISA started its training and support activities, the importance of managing information security incidents has grown to become a top priority for companies, government institutions, universities, schools, and EU Member States. CERTs have emerged in all sectors and countries, and the number of national and governmental CERTs is continuing to grow. This trend is expected to continue worldwide for the foreseeable future. The Roadmap focuses on proposals which will benefit most of the European CERT community: ENISA support to the TRANSITS Framework and other suitable training programmes ENISA CERT Exercises at universities ENISA as co-provider of CERT trainers and training CERT Training Information Desk Video material by ENISA – how to organise the exercises ‘Fire Drills’ for the CERT community ENISA CERT Training Hubs (ECTH) ENISA CERT Exercises Certified Provider (ECTCP) Recommendations for public administration organisations (national exercises) Certification paths The full Roadmap is available here: Roadmap to provide more proactive and efficient CERT training Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

The event brought together public bodies with experience in raising Network and Information Security (NIS) awareness, and private sector organisations working on Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) and other initiatives. The event’s emphasis was on mechanisms for cross-border cooperation, as well as for public-private cooperation and information exchange. Key recommendations include awareness raising actions for PPPs. These are: Make companies aware that awareness raising will help to create business opportunities and make money, through building a favourable, security-conscious brand image Work on cyber security as a matter of cultural challenge and behavioural change. Have in mind the importance of not scaring the users - encourage them to get online but get safe at the same time. Do not start technical. This is about communication. Therefore, messages have to echo with the target audiences. Educate young users as good promoters of the security message - through them you can often reach their parents too. Start education early - the sooner this starts, the better the Internet behaviour. Consider media as a main channel, including social media networks, to get key messages out. Improve measurement of the impact and success of the awareness raising (use key performance indicators, KPIs). The challenge is to go from measuring activities to measuring outcomes.

ENISA_PR_0979	2012-11-28	PR	New report on how to reinforce cooperation between EU Computer Emergency Response Teams  (CERTs) and Law Enforcement Authorities	 The report establishes that such cooperation is essential in the fight against cybercrime. The study focuses on identifying the current gaps and possible synergies, and provides five recommendations on how to improve cooperation. Europe’s society and digital economy are increasingly dependent upon cyber-space. Simultaneously, cyber-attacks on Critical Infrastructure such as energy, water and transportation systems, cyber-incidents, and cybercrime, such as botnet attacks and hacking, put the information society at risk. Moreover, most citizens - 59% - do not feel informed about cyber-crime risks.  ENISA’s new study finds that collaboration between CERTs and LEAs is hindered by their inherent cultural differences. CERTs are typically technical, informal and focused on addressing information system issues. LEAs, by comparison, act when they suspect that a crime has been committed. The report also identifies a number of legal and regulatory barriers. Specifically, it identified a discrepancy between a bigger awareness of national laws, compared to a smaller awareness of international legal frameworks (EU directives or the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention). A number of operational factors were also identified as playing a role in hindering information exchange and collaboration. Experts who participated in the study recognised that information on roles and parameters for cooperation were the most important issues. These were followed by concerns over bureaucracy, different or unknown policies and procedures, lack of common standards, lack of clarity on what the other party will do with information and insufficient or inappropriate detail. The report makes five key recommendations to overcome these barriers: training, improving structures to support information sharing, facilitation of collaboration, good practice development and harmonisation and clarification of legal and regulatory aspects.   These recommendations cover the expansion of training between CERTs and LEAs, establishing each stakeholder’s core competencies, capabilities and procedures, good practice on writing Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and evidence sharing agreements, and further clarification for CERTs on tackling data protection issues. The Executive Director of ENISA Professor Udo Helmbrecht commented: “Computer Emergency Response Teams and Law Enforcement Agencies cover crucial but different aspects of cyber security. Cooperation between them is vital to properly protect our digital citizens and economy. However, until now little research was done on how to connect these two areas. This study contributes to better fighting cybercrime by identifying the collaboration challenges, and ways to overcome them.” For full report For background: COM/2011/163, (Flash Eurobarometer Cyber-Security) 2012 For interviews: Ulf Bergstrom, Spokesman, press@enisa.europa.eu, +30 6948 460 143, or Jo De Muynck, Seconded National Expert, at opsec@enisa.europa.eu Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0981	2012-11-27	PR	“Cooperation is key for Europe’s cyber security” – Conclusion of ENISA Brussels event (27/11) 	" The meeting, held today (27th November) in Brussels, was led by ENISA’s Executive Director, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, and brought together key figures from the European Parliament, European Commission and the computer industry. Participants included Ms Amelia Andersdotter, MEP and Mr Anthony Whelan, representing the Commission as Head of Cabinet for Vice President and Commissioner for the Digital Agenda Mrs Neelie Kroes. They were joined by Mr Paul Timmers, Director at DG Connect. Industry representatives were Mr Paul Nicholas, Senior Director, at Microsoft, and Mr Tom Koehler, CEO at Cassidian Cybersecurity, Germany. ENISA is currently in the process of having its working remit renewed and revised, with a new Regulation being finalised by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers. The new Regulation will enable ENISA to better support Europe’s cyber security needs. European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes said: ""The key to strong cyber security is sharing responsibility. That is the 'name of the game' for this event and for ENISA, and it's a more important challenge than ever as the role of the internet in our economy and society continues to grow rapidly."" Professor Helmbrecht said:  “Europe’s information society depends on secure technology, well-built laws and policies and security-aware citizens. Our event today underlined that there is a strong need for closer cyber cooperation to build an even stronger level of European cyber security, for our citizens and Europe’s digital economy.”  At the conference, ENISA’s recent successes   in building cooperation between different cyber communities  was recognised. Examples included: Supporting the set-up of up new national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) in Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Romania Providing support for CERTS Close cooperation with the Commission, Member States & now private sector on cyber security exercises Conducting the first Europe-wide cyber security exercise with the private sector involved,- Cyber Europe 2012[1]   Facilitating the first Annual Privacy Forum held, with the close support of the Cyprus EU Presidency. ENISA’s ground-breaking role in producing the first ever comprehensive reports on cyber security breaches in Europe (under Article 13a of the EU telecoms directive) Other areas addressed included the need for common standards in cyber security, to better enable Europe’s IT industry to compete more effectively globally. Currently, other markets, notably the United States, are ahead of Europe in having common recognised standards.  Anthony Whelan provided the European Commission perspective, looking at the EU’s forthcoming Cyber Security Strategy, and also gave an update on the progress of the new ENISA Regulation.   For agenda of the event.

ENISA_PR_0983	2012-11-22	PR	Cyber security according to Winnie the Pooh: new report by EU Agency ENISA on ‘digital trap’ honeypots to detect cyber-attacks creates a buzz	 An increasing number of complex cyber-attacks demand better early warning detection capabilities for CERTs. Honeypots are, simplified, traps with the sole task of luring in attackers by mimicking a real computing resource (e.g. a service, application, system, or data). Any entity connecting to a honeypot is deemed suspicious, and all activity is monitored to detect malicious activity. This study is a follow-up to a recent ENISA report on Proactive Detection of Network Security Incidents. The previous report concluded that while honeypots were recognised by CERTs as providing crucial insight into hacker behaviour, their usage to detect and investigate attacks was still not as widespread as might be expected. This implied barriers to their deployment. This new study presents practical deployment strategies and critical issues for CERTs. In total, 30 honeypots of different categories were tested and evaluated. Goal: to offer insight into which open source solutions and honeypot technology are best for deployment and usage. Since there is no silver bullet solution, this new study has identified some shortcomings and deployment barriers for honeypots: the difficulty of usage, poor documentation, lack of software stability and developer support, little standardisation, and a requirement for highly skilled people, as well as problems in understanding basic honeypot concepts. The study also presents a classification and explores the future of honeypots. The Executive Director of ENISA Professor Udo Helmbrecht commented: “Honeypots offer a powerful tool for CERTs to gather threat intelligence without any impact on the production infrastructure. Correctly deployed, honeypots offer considerable benefits for CERTs; malicious activity in a CERT’s constituency can be tracked to provide early warning of malware infections, new exploits, vulnerabilities and malware behaviour, as well as give an opportunity to learn about attacker tactics. Therefore, if the CERTs in Europe recognise honeypots better as a tasty option, they could better defend their constituencies’ assets.“   For full report For background: COM(2009)149 and  NATO’s Legal Implications of Countering Botnets   For interviews, please contact: Ulf Bergstrom, Spokesman, press@enisa.europa.eu or mobile: +30 6948 460 143, or Cosmin Ciobanu, ENISA Expert, at opsec@enisa.europa.eu Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0984	2012-11-20	PR	New report by EU Agency ENISA, focussing on technical aspects of “the right to be forgotten”	 The regulation is still to be adopted by the European Parliament. Therefore the EU’s ‘cyber security’ Agency ENISA is launching its new report covering the technical aspects of “being forgotten”, as technology and information systems play a critical role in enforcing this right. The report identifies technical limitations and a further need for clear definitions and legal clarifications before appropriate technical means to enforce this right can be properly implemented. Some key recommendations of the paper are: Policymakers and data protection bodies should work together to clarify definitions to assist the enforcement of the right (clarification of who can ask for the deletion of shared personal data, under what circumstances, etc.). Furthermore, with such definitions, the associated costs need to be considered. A purely technical solution to enforcing this right in the open Internet is impossible. An interdisciplinary approach is needed and policymakers should be aware of this fact. A possible, pragmatic approach to assist in implementing this right is to require search engine operators and sharing services within the EU to filter references to “forgotten” information stored inside and outside the EU region. Particular care must be taken concerning the deletion of personal data stored on discarded and offline storage devices. The report complements two other recent ENISA publications: the study on data storage and collection in Europe and the paper on the privacy implications of online behavioural tracking. In this broader context, policymakers should ensure the use of technologies supporting the principle of minimal disclosure in order to minimise the amount of personal data collected and stored online. The Agency also recommends the use of encryption for the storage and transfer of personal data. Particular attention should be given to tracking and profiling online, and enforcement solutions should be deployed to block inappropriate behaviour and to force compliance with regulations regarding personal data protection. The Executive Director of ENISA Professor Udo Helmbrecht commented: “A uniform approach is needed in Europe to secure the fundamental right of personal data protection. The reform of the data protection laws in Europe is a decisive step in this direction. ENISA’s reports provide a technical information security perspective supporting this reform.” For full report and all recommendations.

ENISA_NEWS_0985	2012-11-16	NEWS	New report on Supply Chain Integrity launched	 Understanding supply chains is a critical factor in business success and thus to the economy of nation states. Integrity is the element of managing the supply chain that this report focusses on, with a view to providing guidance to EU member states. This paper identifies what the Supply Chain and Integrity means in the ICT context. Safe products, systems and components -from the start till end? Supply chains have become increasingly global in recent years and have become longer both geographically and in the number of supply elements. This is consistent with the globalisation of markets, and the move away from a major industry and its suppliers being geographically locally limited to each other. Telecommunications operators and equipment manufacturers increasingly rely on globally sourced components. For niche markets, a single supplier may support the entire industry (e.g. Microsoft supplying Operating Systems to 83% of the PC market) with distribution channels serving the dependent markets. A characteristic of the ICT market is the ability to distribute software, firmware and chip designs in “soft formats”; this gives a different perspective to ICT supply chain analysis in relation to other forms of raw material, logistic distribution networks, and staff. Structure of supply chains A supply chain is not really a chain with each link joining two  suppliers together in a single path from the start till the end of the chain. A loss of a single link would then be visible and the impact instant – the chain breaks.  In practice, supply chains are more like the fishbone structure. ICT supply chain integrity is consequently relevant for both hardware (PC:s USB, etc) and software products, as well as and services (system of apparatus, appliances, employees, etc). Product oriented supply chains can consist of software and hardware design, testing, production, delivery, repair, support, and maintenance, as well as organizations, people, and processes, engaged in its operations. Supply chains related to telecommunications services include network design, testing, installation, network management. The increased demand for security-supply chain integrity. This report originates on the assertion that Governments, corporations, organizations, and consumers are increasingly reliant on ICT products and services to protect the society and economy. As a result of this, reliance and security threats to ICT supply chains have attracted more attention, including the threat of intentional tampering during development, distribution or operations, or the threat of substitution with counterfeit (including cloned or overproduced) components before or during delivery, and attacks against the economy through the supply chain. Recommendations The present report identifies the nature of these threats and examines the strategies used to counter them. The report finally recommends that supply chain actors follow a core set of good practices to provide a common basis to assess and manage ICT supply chain risk –Moreover, the report recognise that governments must work in collaboration with private industry to build international assessment frameworks.

ENISA_NEWS_0986	2012-11-14	NEWS	Is e-data the new currency? New ENISA report looks at privacy and tracking 	 The new Regulation proposal by the European Commission (COM2012/11/final), aims to address these challenges from a legal perspective. This ENISA study provides a technical aspect on behavioural tracking, identifying the need for an interdisciplinary approach to address the privacy risks associated with tracking mechanisms. Risks from tracking include global surveillance by governments and companies; service and price discrimination; and personalisation risks from data filtering. Protective measures are focused at a technological, legislative and educational level. ENISA’s recommendations are addressed to regulators, policy stakeholders, researchers and developers. These proposals include: anti-tracking initiatives and solutions for mobile applications; development of easy-to-use tools for transparency and control; enforcement of compliance with rules and regulations on personal data protection monitoring and detecting violations; and promoting privacy-by-design to ensure meaningful privacy policies.

ENISA_PR_0989	2012-10-25	PR	The Anatomy of National and International Cyber Security Exercises; new report by the EU cyber-security Agency ENISA	 Information on national and multinational cyber-exercises was gathered worldwide and analysed in this report. We found that a total of 22 European countries were conducting national cyber-security exercises during the last years.  The key findings include: Cyber-exercises have increased in numbers recent years; 71% occurred 2010-2012. The reasons are the overall policy context that boosts cyber-exercises, an increased emphasis by EU Member States thereupon, and the increasing threat of cross border cyber incidents and attacks. Cyber-security and cyber crisis cooperation efforts are receiving ever more attention. There is an essential need to intensify public–private cooperation on cyber-exercises, as the ownership of most of the critical information infrastructures lies in private hands. Proper planning, monitoring and evaluation methods are crucial for effective cyber-exercises.   Some statistical features show that: 64% of the multinational exercises involved more than 10 countries, 13% involved 6–10 countries and 13% involved 3–5 countries. In 57% of the exercises both the public and private sector participated, while 41% involved only the public sector. Two-thirds of the analysed exercises were national exercises and one-third was multinational exercises. This indicates a tendency for international cooperation, although national security matters usually are domestic concerns. Exercises also generated media footprint for 74% of them, creating national cyber-security awareness.                                                                         The seven key recommendations of the report are: Establish a more integrated global cyber exercise community; Ensure exchange of good practices on cyber-exercises, including public–private cooperation; Support development of exercise management tools for better exercise planning, execution and evaluation; Conduct more complex cyber-exercises at inter-sectorial, international and European levels; Exercises should be included in the lifecycle of national cyber crisis contingency plans; Promote the good practices for national exercises, and initiate a step-by-step methodology for  cross-border cyber-exercises; Develop feedback mechanisms for ensuring that lessons learned from cyber-exercises   The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, remarked: “The ENISA study shows that a broad consensus exists for cyber-exercises being an essential instrument to assess the preparedness of a community against cyber crises, and to enhance the responsiveness of stakeholders against critical information infrastructure incidents. Based on the report results we will see a growing number of multinational exercises, like our recent Cyber Europe 2012, involving also the private sector.” Please refer to the full report.

ENISA_PR_0991	2012-10-22	PR	Midpoint report on the first European Cyber Security Month: A Successful Start	" Going into the second half of the first ECSM, thousands of viewers have seen the ECSM video produced by ENISA, which takes a light-hearted, fun approach to cyber security. The video portrays how citizens willingly share private information online, and reminds you in a witty way to pay attention to what you make public, e.g. stating online being away is an invitation for burglars. The ECSM runs throughout October, being organised by eight EU and EEA countries (the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Norway, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Portugal, and the United Kingdom). It is supported by ENISA and the European Commission. Key activities, so far, include: In Portugal: 300 professionals from more than 75 enterprises and organisations attended their events. In Norway: 13 events and social media campaigns are planned. In Spain: León, 122 students attended lectures on Internet security and social networks, with a focus on teenagers, parents and teachers. This included tales and a drawing competition called ""What do you know about security?"" for children 5-12 years old. In Luxembourg: An IT security stand at the nine-day-long annual Autumn Fair attracted more than 1,000 visitors in the first weekend alone, emptying the stand of campaign material and made the front page of Wort, the biggest daily! In Slovenia: Two Slovenian stand-up comedians are starring in three educational videos. The national campaign started on October 17, with TV ads being broadcast (reaching more than 70% of the population) and a Facebook campaign being launched. The following events are starting now for the second half of the ECSM: United Kingdom: A road-show visiting five major cities (Cardiff, London, Leeds, Edinburgh and Belfast) will start on October 22 during the Get Safe Online week. The theme is ‘Click & Tell’, with online safety tips for friends, family, colleagues and neighbours. Czech Republic: A roundtable discussion on online child protection with NGOs, Czech internet hotlines, CSIRT teams and industry stakeholders. Online and media campaigns will also be held. Romania: The ‘Cyber Threats 2012’ conference and social media campaigns with security advice will take place.   Background: ECSM Material The European Commission’s Digital Agenda for Europe, action point 32 For interviews: Ulf Bergström, Spokesman, mobile phone: +30 6948 460 43, press@enisa.europa.eu, or Isabella Santa, Expert, awareness@enisa.europa.eu Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn YouTube and RSS feeds Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_0993	2012-10-18	PR	Workplace IT: ENISA sees opportunities and risks in “Bring Your Own Device” trend	 In today’s high-pressure work environment, mobility and networked knowledge are two key factors shaping the future of professional life. These factors, combined with the consumerisation of all kinds of IT components, make it imperative to consider the role of private IT in corporate IT strategies. The “Bring Your Own Device” option, where staff use their personal computers to perform tasks in the workplace or elsewhere, can bring a wide range of potential benefits. Among the opportunities presented by this consumerisation of IT are: employer and staff flexibility on hours and work locations savings through lower infrastructure costs increased productivity and staff satisfaction through developing their own skills  lower infrastructure costs from moving to flexible IT solutions, such as cloud computing But with the potential benefits come risks, which must be foreseen, with proper policies and mitigation strategies. Among the top risks are: confidential information being lost, stolen or made public, whether through poor IT security on personal devices, or through the theft of mobile devices or computers potential issues over data ownership, unauthorized sharing, and legal governance over devices, programs and content increased opportunities for cyber-criminals to target corporate data   Overall, ENISA identifies three main areas of risk, relating to: cost, legal and regulatory issues, and data confidentiality/integrity/availability. Potential benefits fall into the areas of finance, human resources, operational opportunities and data management. Commenting on the report, ENISA’s Executive Director, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, said: “In today’s workplace, mobility and consumerisation of IT is often a great opportunity for staff and employers to reap the benefits offered by modern IT:  increased flexibly and potential reduction of costs. Some of the security risks involved are relatively classic, such as failing to ensure that devices and applications are secure, and sharing information inappropriately. Others, such as legal questions, are more complex, but if properly addressed, will allow for more effective working regimes and tools.” The full report is available here.

ENISA_NEWS_0996	2012-10-12	NEWS	Successful conclusion for the First Annual Privacy Forum 	" Held in  Limassol, Cyprus,  the  event was co-organised by the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) and the European Commission Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT), with the support of the Department of Computer Science of the University of Cyprus. APF’12 was endorsed as an official event of the Cyprus Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The  1st Annual Privacy Forum’s objective was to create a space for dialogue between representatives of industry, researchers and policymakers. The Forum’s inaugural year  has proved a great success, with  approximately 70 delegates  participating. Steve Purser, Head of ENISA’s Technical Competence Department, points out the Agency’s role: ‘’As far as privacy in the EU is concerned, we are moving from the policy and legislative phase to the implementation phase and this is where ENISA can make a real difference.’’ DG CONNECT, through the presence of Trust and Security Policy Coordinator, Rosa Barcelo emphasizes that, ‘’We need a regulatory environment that protects individuals’ privacy in a changing technological environment, while at the same time stimulating growth and innovation."" Co-Chair of APF’2012 Prof. Marios Dikaiakos, University of Cyprus, expressed his satisfaction with the productive discussions that have taken place: ‘’Data Privacy is one of the key socio-technical and policy challenges in the Information Society, with important ramifications for the development of the Internet economy. The University of Cyprus was delighted to contribute to the organization of this successful event that brought to Cyprus world experts in data privacy, in collaboration with ENISA, DG CONNECT and under the auspices of the Cyprus Presidency of the European Council.’’ With privacy becoming an ever more debated issue, both the timing and themes of the event were well chosen. This was illustrated by the highly focused discussions that followed each session, as well as the support offered to the conference by leading organisations in ICT, such as the Business Software Alliance (BSA) and the Cyprus Telecommunication Authority (CYTA). Background: Privacy is a fundamental need and a basic right. The European Commission proposed in January 2012 a reform of the EU's data protection rules to strengthen online privacy rights.

ENISA_PR_0998	2012-10-11	PR	First annual report of cyber incidents in the EU: 51 severe outages reported over 2011	 Under Article 13a of the EU’s telecom reform directive (Directive 2009/140/EC), EU Member States are required to make summary reports on major outages once a year to ENISA and the European Commission. The first summary incident reports for 2011 were sent to ENISA in May 2012. In total, 11 countries reported outages. This number reflects the fact that many countries implemented national reporting schemes only towards the end of 2011. ENISA Experts Marnix Dekker and Christoffer Karsberg remark: “This year, the Member States have more mature national incident reporting schemes. So next year we expect to publish an annual report with about 10 times more incidents.” In the annual report, ENISA summarizes and analyses the 51 reported incidents: Most of the reported incidents affected mobile telephony or mobile internet (60%). Incidents affecting mobile telephony or mobile internet affected most users (around 300.000 users), which is consistent with the high number of mobile users. Incidents show that communication services (both fixed and mobile) strongly depend on the power supply. Natural phenomena like storms, floods and heavy snow have a big impact on the power supply of providers. Natural phenomena cause long lasting incidents, around 45 hours on average. The annual report also provides a summary of Article 13a and how it was implemented by ENISA and the EU Member States. The incidents will be discussed in more detail in the Article 13a working  group which consists of all electronic communication regulators from EU countries, and technical experts from ENISA. In 2013, ENISA and the EC will collect the incident reports concerning outages that occurred in 2012. The next annual report will be published in the spring of 2013. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht comments: “We are now, for the first time, equipped with an overview of major cyber incidents in Europe. This is a decisive moment for the EU’s efforts to improve understanding of the impact of cyber security incidents. But this still deals with only a small subset of cyber security incidents. This type of reporting should be extended to cover a wider range of incidents and more sectors.” For the full report with all data and analysis: Annual Incidents Report 2011 For interviews: Graeme Cooper, Head of Public Affairs, ENISA, Mobile: +30 6951 782 268 or Dr Marnix Dekker, resilience@enisa.europa.eu.

ENISA_NEWS_1000	2012-10-05	NEWS	Cyber Europe 2012 – first results show success	 Cyber Europe 2012 was a day-long simulated cyber attack on Europe’s critical information infrastructures. It was used to analyse how participating countries’ and private sector organisations would cooperate in the event of a real large-scale attack. ENISA’s headline observations from the “hot wash” exercise review session held today (05/10/2012) are: There was frequent cooperation and information exchange between public and private sector organisations Public-Private cooperation structure differed per country Some countries responded by upscaling their national crisis cells/crisis plans/crisis structures Some countries suffered from real incidents besides the CE2012 exercise Familiarity with procedures is crucial for building a fast and effective response capability across Europe There is a need for close understanding between players and a need to be able to communicate quickly with key contacts in national authorities and the private sector The inclusion of private sector organisations as players was an excellent addition. Their input and experience helped build realistic scenarios and make exercise highly effective on the day. (Most Critical Information Infrastructure is owned by the private sector.)  Overall, there were approx. 60 banks and 60 ISPs taking part in the various countries.  Simulations were highly realistic. Players were under pressure so as to assess how this would affect cooperation   Conclusions from the exercise will be considered by the European Commission and Member States in drafting Europe’s Cyber Security Strategy ENISA plans to produce its Cyber Europe 2012 exercise report by the end of the year Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases! News items: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/news-wires/RSS PRs: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/press-releases/RSS 	https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/cyber-europe-2012-2013-first-results-show-success
ENISA_PR_1001	2012-10-04	PR	Europe joins forces in Cyber Europe 2012	 The exercise builds on and ties together extensive activities at both the national and European level to improve the resilience of critical information infrastructures. As such, Cyber Europe 2012 is a major milestone in the efforts to strengthen cyber crisis cooperation, preparedness and response across Europe. Cyber Europe 2012 is a distributed table-top exercise organised by the Member States of the European Union and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries. It is facilitated by the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) and supported by the European Commission's in-house science service, the Joint Research Centre (JRC). Compared to the 2010 exercise, Cyber Europe 2012 has grown considerably in scope, scale and complexity. Cyber Europe 2012 has three objectives:  Test effectiveness and scalability of existing mechanisms, procedures and information flow for public authorities’ cooperation in Europe; Explore the cooperation between public and private stakeholders in Europe; Identify gaps and challenges on how large scale cyber incidents could be handled more effectively in Europe. Four countries are observing the exercise and 25 countries are actively participating. Using the lessons learned from Cyber Europe 2010, the private sector (from finance, ISPs and eGovernment) is taking part for the first time. In the exercise, public and private participants across Europe will take action at the national level. At the same time, public participants will cooperate across borders. The scenario for Cyber Europe 2012 combines several technically realistic threats into one simultaneously escalating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on online services in all participating countries. This kind of scenario would disrupt services for millions of citizens across Europe. The complexity of the scenario allows for the creation of enough cyber incidents to challenge the several hundred public and private sector participants from throughout Europe, while at the same time triggering cooperation. By the end of the exercise, the participants will have had to handle more than 1000 injects (simulated cyber incidents). The Executive Director of ENISA, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, comments: “ENISA aims to support the cyber crisis community in improving the resilience of critical information infrastructures. That is why we facilitated the organisation of Cyber Europe 2012.” Background The European Commission’s communication from 2009 on CIIP paved the way for the first pan-European Cyber Exercise. In the Digital Agenda,[1] ENISA was given the role of supporting EU and EFTA Member States in organising and running national exercises.[2] In 2009, ENISA published a ‘Good Practice Guide on National Exercises’ and the Agency has since then held many workshops across Europe to assist in the planning of national exercises. The Agency will soon publish a guide to national contingency planning. Note The exercise does not affect real critical information infrastructures, systems or services.

ENISA_PR_1013	2012-08-31	PR	30 new top cyber security advisors appointed to the EU Agency ENISA’s Permanent Stakeholders’ Group	 A new composition of 30 top IT-security experts have started their term of office as members of ENISA’s Permanent Stakeholders’ Group (PSG). The PSG will give top IT security advice to the EU’s ‘cyber security’ Agency ENISA, the European Network and Information Security Agency. The PSG is a group of leading IT-security experts that gives advice to the Agency’s Executive Director in, for example, drawing up a proposal for the Agency's annual Work Programme. The selected applicants are appointed personally, ‘ad personam’ as PSG Members. That means that they neither represent a country, nor a company, but are selected upon the basis of their own specific expertise and personal merits. The term of office for the members is 2.5 years, i.e. 2012-2015. The first meeting of the new PSG will take place on 13 September 2012, in Athens. A list of the appointed members can be downloaded from here: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/psg/members   The Executive Director of ENISA, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, comments: “I am delighted to be able to announce the appointment of 30 dedicated top cyber security advisors as members of this new PSG. The information security of Europe needs more cooperation, dialogue and interaction with all the security stakeholders. The PSG therefore plays a crucial role in this respect, giving us cutting-edge input from EU industry, academia and consumers. I am thus looking forward to working closely with the entire new PSG. I am confident that their individual expertise will contribute with valuable insights and ideas to the Agency.

ENISA_NEWS_1014	2012-08-29	NEWS	New animated logo of the European Cyber Security Month now online	 This animated logo has been achieved by using the portraits sent by people who participated in the advertising campaign of ENISA, launched at the beginning of this summer, inviting them to become the ‘face’ of the ECSM. The animation underline the key features of the logo; the key symbolising security, the shape of a person in profile, and the human factor in the centre, among other characteristics.  The reasoning behind this campaign is to visualise that cyber security ultimately is backed up by people, showing their determination and commitment to do their part. This short animation will be used together with other material to promote cyber security to citizens. The objectives of the European Cyber Security Month, which is taking place in October, is to increase knowledge of Network and Information Security (NIS) issues, modify perceptions of threats, and provide updated security information through education, good practices and competitions. Brief background: The European Commission’s Digital Agenda for Europe, action point 32: “Strengthen the fight against cybercrime at international level” specifically identifies a European Cyber Security Month.   For more background on the European Cyber Security Month For further ECSM material For the ECSM Feasibility study (end 2011).     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_1015	2012-08-29	NEWS	Smart grids in focus at CRITIS12 conference in Norway	 CRITIS is a highly reputable conference, gathering academics experts from all over the world to present their innovative research ideas and to explore new challenges in the critical information infrastructures security. ENISA is organizing a track within this conference, with focus on vulnerability and risk assessment for industrial control systems (ICS) and smart grids. ENISA Track Objectives ENISA's studies have shown that current control systems environments' risk assessments do not identify or prioritize most significant technical risks and potential impacts to operations that would support the business case for investing in cyber security. For that reason, new risk assessment methodologies are needed in order to address the vulnerabilities and complexity of the industrial environments. If you are interested in ICS and smart grid security, take advantage of the opportunity of presence of field experts, and join us. Agenda Workshop date: 18th of September Expected results; Identifying the key requirements for a new risk assessment methodology for the ICS and smart grids.

ENISA_PR_1016	2012-08-27	PR	EU agency ENISA analyses cyber security legislation & spots implementation gaps; incidents remain undetected or not reported	 Cyber security incidents significantly impact society. Here are five well-known examples: In 2012, millions of business network passwords were exposed In 2011, the storm Dagmar wrecked millions of Scandinavian communication links In 2011, a British data centre failure interrupted millions of business communications worldwide In 2011, a certificate authority was breached exposing the communications of millions of users In 2010, a Chinese telecom provider hijacked 15% of the world’s internet traffic for 20 minutes Each time, millions of citizens and businesses were seriously impacted. But most incidents are not reported or not even detected. Dr Marnix Dekker and Chris Karsberg, the report’s co-authors, argue: “Cyber incidents are most commonly kept secret when discovered, leaving customers and policymakers in the dark about frequency, impact and root causes.” The new report ’’Cyber Incident Reporting in the EU’’ provides an overview of existing and planned legislation (please see graphic attached) covering the mandatory incident reporting clauses in Article 13a of the Telecom package and Article 4 of the e-privacy directive, the proposed e-ID regulation’s Article 15, and Articles 30, 31, 32 of the Data Protection reform. The study shows common factors and differences between the articles and looks ahead to the EU cyber security strategy. The paper also identifies areas for improvement. For example, only one of the above-mentioned incidents was within the scope of the national regulators mandate, indicating that there are gaps in the regulation. Thus, EU-wide sharing of incident reports sharing should be improved. Much progress has been made recently: An ENISA working group for national regulators has developed both a common set of security measures and an incident reporting format. This will enable a more uniform implementation of Article 13a. ENISA just received reports on 51 large incidents from the regulators, describing impact, root causes, actions taken and lessons learnt. This material is used as input for the European cyber security strategy and the European cyber security exercise. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, commented: “Incident reporting is essential to obtain a true cyber security picture. The EU’s cyber security strategy is an important step and one of its goals is to extend the scope of reporting provisions like Article 13a beyond the telecommunications sector.” For Full Report Background: European Cyber Security Strategy and Art 13a working group documents For interviews: Ulf Bergstrom, Spokesman, ENISA, press@enisa.europa.eu, Mobile: + 30 6948 460 143, or, Dr Marnix Dekker, ENISA, marnix.dekker@enisa.europa.eu Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_1022	2012-07-19	NEWS	Visit by the European Ombudsman	 ENISA is the 12th EU-body that the European Ombudsman Professor Nikiforos Diamandouros  has visited so far, since 2011. He was joined this time by his Legal Advisor Mr Antonios Antoniadis. The European Ombudsman is looking at administrative good practices of all EU-bodies, to assure that there are practices, policies and principles in place for good administration. This includes, amongst other things, recruitment, selection procedures, governance procedures and transparency, whistleblowing, confidentiality rules, ethics of good administration and conduct for civil servants, usability and availability of the web site as to be transparent, and other matters of good administration for public bodies. Having good administration in place is part of making the EU system more democratically transparent for the citizens. The office of the European Ombudsman works with the public EU-bodies in a constructive dialogue to improve this system. During the visit the European Ombudsman met the Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, relevant ENISA staff members, and the ENISA Staff Committee.  European Ombudsman’s work more in detail The European Ombudsman works together with the inspected bodies, as an external mechanism of control. His office constitutes a repository and access to a vast amount of knowledge on good administrative behaviour. This is to the benefit and at the disposal of all EU bodies. They can receive administrative advice, and use the European Ombudsman as a mechanism of guidance, who can transmit best practices of other bodies, so as to improve the proceedings of a particular EU body in a specific field. The office of the Ombudsman investigates the practices and administration practices of the EU bodies, so as to secure and improve the good, democratic and modern administrative behaviour with its advice and recommendations. The European Ombudsman also recently published his guide on ethical principles for EU officials . Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_1027	2012-07-10	PR	New ENISA study: 10 recommendations for making European smart grids safer	 A smart grid is an upgraded electricity network with two-way digitalcommunication between supplier and consumer. The adoption of smart grids will dramatically change the distribution and control of energy for solar panels, small wind turbines, electric vehicles, etc. By making energy distribution more efficient, smart grids give clear benefits to users, electricity suppliers, grid operators, and society as a whole. At the same time, their dependency on computer networks and Internet makes our society more vulnerable to cyber-attacks, with potentially devastating results. Therefore, to prepare for a successful roll-out of smart grids, this study proposes 10 security recommendations for the public and private sector out of almost 100 findings. Some key report recommendations include: The European Commission (EC) and thecompetent authorities of the Member States (MS) need to provide a clear, regulatory and policy framework on smart grid cyber security at the national and EU level, as this presently is missing. The EC, in collaboration with ENISA, the MS,and the private sector, should develop a minimum set of security measures based on existing standards and guidelines. Both the EC and the MS authorities shouldpromote security certification schemes for the entire value chain of smart grids components, including organisational security. The MS authorities should involve ComputerEmergency Response Teams to play an advisory role in power grids’ cyber security. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, commented; “Our study shows that the two ‘separate worlds’ of the energy sector versus the IT security sector must be aligned on security for smart grids. We estimate that without taking cyber security into serious consideration, smart grids may evolve in an uncoordinated manner. I would therefore suggest that smart grids’ security be made part of the EU’s forthcoming Internet Security Strategy.” Cyber security aspects of smart grids Smart grids give rise to new information security challenges for electricity networks. Information systems’ vulnerabilities may be exploited for financial or political motivation in cyber-attacks to shut off power plants. In 2009, US officials recognised that cyber spies had hacked into the US electricity grid (Source: DowJones/The Wall Street Journal). Software and hardware for the smart grid infrastructure are thus high risk targets. Therefore, reducing barriers to information sharing is vital for the success of smart grids.

ENISA_PR_1028	2012-07-05	PR	Flash note: EU cyber security agency ENISA; “High Roller” online bank robberies reveal security gaps	 The recent, targeted “High Roller” cyber-attacks on wealthy corporate bank accounts yielding tens of millions of dollars was analysed in a report recently published by McAfee and Guardian Analytics. The report describes the technical details and the impact of a series of cyber-attacks. The old adage that “criminals go where the money is” today means that “bank robbers go online”, as the Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht states. It should come as no surprise that large organized crime groups are targeting online banking sites. Still, the attacks drew much attention, for three reasons. 1) Highly automated: The attackers reduced manual intervention to a minimum, relying mostly on automation. The attacks were also fast and easily missed by the user. 2) Sophisticated: The banks’ protection measures, such as two-factor authentication and fraud detection, were circumvented. Users did not notice this right away because the fraudulent transactions were hidden by malware (inserting javascript code into pages). 3) Targeted: Only PCs from users with corresponding high balances were targeted (e.g. around 5000 PCs in the Netherlands). The cyber-attacks had three phases. First, targets were identified using online reconnaissance and (spear) phishing. Victims with access to high balance accounts (hence the name “High Rollers”) were singled out. Secondly, malware (SpyEye, Zeus and Ice 9) was loaded onto the victim’s PC - tailor customised for the victim’s online banking websites. The malware was triggered when the victim started an online banking session. SpyEye, Zeus and Ice 9 are common types of malware toolkits, tailored for this attack. Later, automated fraudulent transactions were carried out in the name of the user and hidden from them behind warning and waiting messages. The malware transfers sums from savings accounts to checking accounts, then to mules abroad who take the cash and send it onwards using person-to-person money transfer (such as Western Union). A detailed technical analysis and set of recommendations from McAfee and Guardian Analytics can be found online. Recommendations 1. Assume all PCs are infected. The attacks used Zeus, which is a Do-It-Yourself virus kit available for around a thousand EUROs. Zeus has been an off the shelf virus around since 2007 and the detection rate is low . For a bank, in the current situation it is safer to assume that all of its customers’ PCs are infected – and the banks should therefore take protection measures to deal with this. (See image to the right; original source)   2; Secure online banking devices: Many online banking systems, some with one-time transaction codes, calculators or smartcard readers, work based on the assumption that the customer’s PC is not infected. Given the current state of PC security, this assumption is dangerous. Banks should instead assume that PCs are infected, and still take steps to protect customers from fraudulent transactions. For example, a basic two factor authentication does not prevent man-in-the-middle or man-in-the-browser attacks  on transactions. Therefore, it is important to cross check with the user the value and destination of certain transactions, via a trusted channel, on a trusted device (e.g., an SMS, a telephone call, a standalone smartcard reader with screen). Even smartphones could be used here, provided smartphone security holds up. 3. Strong cooperation needed to take down global command centres: The cyber-attack was carried out using command and control servers dynamically located across the globe, using e.g. fast flux botnets  and bullet proof  hosting providers. Criminals use these tricks to make law enforcement and notice-and-takedown more complicated. Therefore, strong global collaboration, both in terms of prevention and in terms of response is needed. ENISA works on fostering closer ties and more information exchange between national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), law enforcements and between EU countries to improve incident response across borders. Approach Preventing cyber-attacks is important, but it is also necessary to be prepared for when attacks happen. ENISA has been working with the different EU member states to ensure every country has well-functioning CERTs to handle cyber security incidents. ENISA organizes large scale international cyber security exercises (for example Cyber Europe 2010, Cyber Atlantic 2011, and the upcoming Cyber Europe 2012) to increase international collaboration against large-scale security incidents. ENISA is also working with member states to improve incident reporting to get more transparency about the causes, the frequency and the impact of past incidents. Currently consumers, businesses and policy makers are forced to make rough estimates. The EC recently announced a forthcoming strategy for Internet security, addressing the possibility of extending Article 13a (mandatory incident reporting and security measures) beyond just the electronic communications sector. Forward look Looking forward, browser security and smartphone security will play an increasingly important role as more and more transactions are being carried out on smartphones or tablets. The rapid adoption of smartphones offers an important opportunity to improve end-point security (for example by using vetted appstores or by using smartphones as second factors) but we should not take smartphone security for granted.

ENISA_PR_1031	2012-06-29	PR	ENISA report calls for kick-start in cyber insurance market	 The report , ‘Incentives and barriers to the cyber insurance market in Europe’  highlights the fact that while cyber security is an important concern for European and national policy makers, businesses and citizens, the traditional coverage offered by Europe’s insurance providers may, with some exceptions, not comprehensively address digital risk. Obstacles to the development of an effective cyber insurance market include lack of actuarial data on the extent of the risk and uncertainty about what type of risk should be insured against. To address these issues, ENISA makes four recommendations: The collection of empirical data on cyber insurance in Europe, looking at types of risk insured, premiums paid and levels of payouts to determine future trends. The action could be taken by insurance underwriters, firms or regulatory authorities. The examination of incentives for firms to improve their data security as a way for them to reduce their risk and financial liability if they breach data protection regulations. Fact finding with the European Commission would be a first step to understanding this area. The establishment of agreed frameworks to help firms put a measurable value on their information. The work could be assisted by privacy and information security advisors, underwrites and the European Commission. ENISA could also provide furthersupport. An exploration of the role of governments as an insurer of last resort, following other models where policy intervention is in evidence when catastrophic risk is involved. This could be investigated by EU Member State governments and the European Commission. ENISA’s Executive Director, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, said:“This new ENISA report indicates that there is potential for Europe’s cyber security policies and legislation must be complemented by a prevention-focused cyber insurance market.

ENISA_NEWS_1032	2012-06-27	NEWS	Smarter & safer distribution of energy through smart grids: Agency workshop	 Smart grids-workshop -for a more secure and effective distribution of energy Today, 27th June, ENISA is conducting a workshop in Brussels together with the European Commission dedicated to the Security Certification of the Smart Grid components. Smart Grids are essential to make future energy distribution more efficient. At the same time, they must be set up in a secure way, to be rolled out successfully. Therefore, security certification across Europe and this workshop is an important step to ensure this. Workshop objectivesTo: support the Member States in better understanding the challenges of the Smart Grid component certification process contribute to a harmonization of different certification policies of the  Member States  invite Member States to present their national certification schemes       and the private sector to present their views on the matter debate about the possible steps to take, at national and EU level, to speed up the secure introduction of Smart Grids What are smart grids?A Smart Grid is an upgraded electricity network, with two-way digital communication between the supplier and the consumer, with intelligent metering and monitoring, which can show the behaviour and actions of all users connected to a Smart Grid. As a result, a user can for example more easily opt to use electricity when it is cheaper, so that energy also would be used more more efficiently. This will dramatically change and improve the control and distribution of energy, for solar panels, small wind turbines, and electric vehicles, machines, etc of ordinary citizens as well for business and industries. This will be to the benefit of consumers, electricity suppliers and grid operators. At the same time, improved operations will come at the cost of exposing the entire electricity network to information security challenges. Therefore ENISA is working on mitigating these challenges. AgendaRead the agenda of the workshop. Draft future report on Cyber Security Aspects of Smart Grids At the workshop, a draft version of the forthcoming report on  Cyber Security Aspects of Smart Grids, to be published in the middle of July, will be discussed and consolidated. 	https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/smarter-and-safer-distribution-of-energy-through-smart-grids-agency-workshop
ENISA_NEWS_1033	2012-06-26	NEWS	Breakthrough of EU-Institutions as they agree on a common approach on EU-Agencies	 Recently, under the Danish EU-Presidency, Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič made a decisive step to clarify the set-up conditions for EU-Agencies, as the EU-Institutions have agreed on a joint statement and common approach. This agreement has been under discussions for a long time, which now sucessfully have been brought to a conclusion. The agreement will improve the agencies' governance and efficiency, and make them a more effective tool in implementing the policies of the EU. The next step is that the agreement now will be formally endorsed by each EU-Institution (Council, European Commission and European Parliament.) What is the impact? For many citizens, agencies are the closest visible presence of the EU in their lives and in their Member State. Yet, their ad hoc set-up, ranging of several years has not been accompanied with an overall vision of their position in the EU. The EU’s common approach will now remedy this, and gradually streamline the EU-Agencies. This new, common approach clarifies the conditions (the framework, funding, structure, supervision, management issues, set up, location, etc) for decentralised EU-Agencies. As such, by deciding on this common approach for all EU-Agencies, it will make the EU more democratically transparent, as well as to make the agencies  function more efficiently, to make the best use of tax payers’ money. Key points of the agreement The common approach contains a range of improvements for EU-Agencies, including: -the need for an objective impact assessment before EU-Institutions are deciding to create a new agency,-criteria for the choice of the seat and headquarters arrangements, -regular overall evaluations (every five years) and - the introduction of sunset or review clauses foreseeing the option of merging or closing down agencies, -ex ante and ex post evaluations of the agencies' programmes/activities, -the development of key performance indicators, -a multi-annual programming to be linked with multiannual resource planning, -a stronger link between actions performed by the agency and human and financial resources, -a streamlined governance structure and making it clear who does what. The Commission will propose a roadmap for implementing this agreement by the second half of 2012, taking into account the unique features of each agency.

ENISA_NEWS_1034	2012-06-26	NEWS	Training day: getting ready for Cyber Europe 2012	 Cyber Europe 2012 is the 2nd pan-European exercise on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP). It builds on and ties together the extensive activities in the EU, at both national and European level, to improve the resilience of critical information infrastructures. The exercise will take place in the autumn. Exercises are an important mechanism to assess preparedness for cyber threats, natural disasters, and technology failures. They enable authorities to target specific weaknesses and increase cooperation among stakeholders. Exercises also identify interdependencies, stimulate continuity planning, and train and educate people. The Cyber Europe 2012 exercise scenario will be based on large-scale cyber incidents where critical information infrastructure is affected across Europe. Policy Context Supporting EU-wide cyber-security preparedness exercises is one of the actions foreseen by the Digital Agenda for Europe to enhance online trust and security - see IP/10/581, MEMO/10/199 and MEMO/10/200. It is also an important part of the efforts to enhance preparedness, security and resilience as laid out in the CIIP communication action plan - see COM(2009) 149 and COM(2011) 163. Organisers of Cyber Europe 2012 Cyber Europe 2012 is organised by the EU Member States and EFTA countries, and jointly supported by the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) and the EU’s Joint Research Centre (JRC).

ENISA_NEWS_1035	2012-06-25	NEWS	ENISA’s international security message	 Organised by ISACA (formerly known as the Information Systems and Control Association), the event brings together a diverse group of global professionals from backgrounds including IT security, audit and management. Professor Helmbrecht said: “Our response to cyber threats need to be coordinated at an international level because cyber attacks are frequently launched from outside the countries that are targeted. The recent ‘Flamer’ spyware virus that targeted PCs in a number of Middle Eastern countries shows the international nature of the threat, and highlights the fact that attackers are developing highly specialised malware. Our success in countering these constantly evolving risks depends on our ability to share knowledge across borders - with governments, the IT industry, the academic world and with IT users. Working with organisations such as ISACA provides ENISA with a further opportunity to share good practice and support improved network and information security for all.” Professor Helmbrecht will be participating as a panellist with Mr Marc Vael of ISACA and a representative from NIST – The US National Institute of Standards and Technology. The session is will cover changing threats, what is around the corner, corporate espionage, coming information sharing, cyber harassment’s impact on business related issues and moving from the physical to the cyber world.

ENISA_PR_1043	2012-05-31	PR	New from ENISA – Updated Map & Inventory of Europe’s “Digital Fire Brigades” with 173 Computer Emergency Response Teams listed	 The latest map of Europe’s “digital fire brigades”, the Computer Emergency Response Teams, CERTs in Europe map, v.2.7, is now online. The “CERTs in Europe map” now shows 173 CERT teams. CERTs are established by EU Member State governments and other public and private sector bodies to enable a fast response to emergencies that could affect vital computer networks or information systems. At the same time as the publication of the map, an updated version of the Inventory of CERT activities in Europe is available. It provides a directory of response teams by country and includes an index of co-operation, support and standardisation activities.   The updated map and Inventory can be found online at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/background/inv and its subpages.   The latest CERT documents are published 12 months after EU Commissioner Neelie Kroes highlighted the importance of CERTs at the Hungarian EU Presidency conference in Balatonfüred. Commissioner Kroes also introduced the concept of ENISA “flying doctors” to be on call for Member States, with the idea developing into ENISA’s ‘Mobile Assistance Team’. The concept was reinforced in a follow-up letter from Commissioner Kroes to the Hungarian Minister Zsolt Nyitrai, and she later restated the idea in a speech. In response, ENISA set up its Mobile Assistance Team, operating from its Athens office, from where Agency experts meet Member States’ requests for assistance. ENISA also continues to support Member States in setting up CERTs with training, workshops, and information updates. The next CERTs map and Inventory update (Q4) will include an upgrade of the online content with a more user-friendly, interactive map for easier access to information. The Agency will also launch a report on the level of deployment of the current baseline capabilities by European national/governmental CERTs. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht comments:“These latest ENISA publications underpin that since Commissioner Kroes highlighted the importance of CERTs and introduced the Mobile Assistance Team concept, CERTs have continued to develop positively. In addition, ENISA’s Mobile Assistance Team is now playing an increasing role with Member States, responding to requests across a range of network and information security areas.”   Background: Updated CERTs map v2.7.Updated Inventory of CERTs v2.7.

ENISA_PR_1047	2012-05-02	PR	ENISA launches new online campaign inviting citizens to be the “face” of European Security Month	 The campaign invites citizens to help create the message “WE ARE European Security Month” by sending in pictures of their faces, which will be used as a montage to spell out the words “WE ARE….”. Each letter will contain approximately 100 photos, giving people the chance to show that they are committed to staying secure online. This photo-message, together with many others, will be used in advertisements and campaign material during the Security Month pilot, which takes place this October. The deadline for submission of photos is 30th June 2012.  Photos should be submitted through ENISA’s web site at http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/security-month/advertising. The page also gives guidance on the pictures being asked for, and consent information for the use of pictures.  The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, comments: “With this campaign, we want to bring European Security Month to life, with images of citizens from all over Europe. IT security is very much about how people use technology. Helping citizens to be more aware of staying secure online is an important part of us all being able use the Internet without breaches of our personal cyber security.” Professor Helmbrecht adds: “European Security Month is a fun and stimulating Europe-wide campaign. Consequently, we look forward to obtaining a strong commitment from the member states, as this is crucial for the initiative’s success. An effective European Security Month can help to reduce the number of cyber security incidents and breaches, and will help to increase consumers’ confidence in the security of the Internet, so contributing to a successful digital economy in Europe.” Background: The European Security Month pilot will take place in October, promoting cyber security to citizens. To date, six European countries – Luxemburg, Portugal, Spain, UK (Get Safe Online), Slovenia and Norway – have confirmed their participation. A diverse range of activities, such as TV and radio advertisements, social media campaigns, the distribution of educational packages and special events will be organised. The pilot will be evaluated to look at how future events may be planned.   ENISA’s   ‘European Month of Network and Information Security for All - A feasibility study’   examines a security month’s benefits and evaluates approximately 130 cyber security events in Europe and their success factors. The study was published at the end of 2011.  The European Commission’s Digital Agenda for Europe, action point 32: “Strengthen the fight against cybercrime at international level” specifically looks towards a cyber security month.   The EU Working Group on Cybersecurity and Cybercrime has identified the need for greater international cooperation in tackling cyber security and cyber crime (click to see EU press release [ref:MEMO/11/246 date 14/04/2011]).

ENISA_PR_1053	2012-04-02	PR	Procure secure: ENISA’s new guide for monitoring cloud computing contracts	 To help solve this problem, the EU’s cyber security agency, ENISA today launched a new, practical guide for IT procurement teams, focusing on continuous security monitoring throughout the life-cycle of a cloud contract. The publication builds on groundwork done by ENISA in 2009, when the Agency produced an assurance framework and tool for IT teams to assess the security of service providers before making a decision to move to the cloud. ENISA now goes one step further, with a follow-up guide detailing how to monitor the security of cloud services throughout the project life-cycle.  The new guide focuses on public procurement, which accounts for nearly 20% of the EU's gross domestic product, around 2.2 trillion euro (Eurostat figures from 2009). Professor  Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA comments: “Europe’s citizens trust public and private sector bodies to keep our data secure. With ever more organisations moving to cloud computing, ENISA’s new guidance is well-timed to help give direction in what is, for many buyers, a completely new area.” A recent ENISA survey on Service Level Agreements, (SLAs) showed that many IT officers in public sector organisations hardly receive any feedback on important security factors, such as service availability, or software vulnerabilities.  The Procure Secure guide helps customers to prepare for monitoring security on an ongoing basis. “ENISA’s guide emphasises the use of continuous security monitoring, in addition to certification and accreditation processes,” says Dr Giles Hogben, editor of the report. The ENISA guide includes a checklist for procurement teams, as well as an in-depth description of each security parameter; what to measure and how. The security parameters covered are: service availability; incident response; service elasticity and load tolerance; data lifecycle management; technical compliance and vulnerability management; change management; data isolation; and log management and forensics. This guide complements a number of cloud security papers published by ENISA, including its widely used 2009 report, Cloud Computing: Benefits, Risks and Recommendations for Information Security. Full report: The report will be presented in detail at the SecureCloud 2012 the only European conference to focus specifically on cloud computing security.

On the first day, there will be a meeting of the European Public Private Partnership for Resilience working group (EP3R), while day two features a workshop on national PPPs. The Agency is particularly keen to have participation from those already involved in, or who would like to establish, PPPs. The workshop (20th April) will be of particular interest, though participants can choose to register for both days. The workshop allows participants to: Join information exchange session on public-private partnerships (PPPs) Get an insight into cooperative models for effective PPPs Hear about real-world examples of PPPs Cooperation in the form of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) has evolved in many EU Member States, and the relevance of PPPs has been widely recognised by both policymakers and industry. The European Commission has proposed concrete policy and regulations for improving the security and resilience of public telecommunications. These include the establishment of a European Public Private Partnership for Resilience (EP3R). This would engage with national PPPs to address Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) issues at a European level. EP3R The 19th of April session will be dedicated to the EP3R Working Groups. This meeting follows on from the EP3R Workshop on 16th February in Brussels, where ENISA presented the state of play in each working group. National PPPs The workshop on 20th April will be dedicated to an Information Exchange Plenary Session about PPPs. This will provide a deeper insight into ENISA's findings on Cooperative Models for Effective Public Private Partnerships, and give real-world examples presented by experts involved in the management of European PPPs. This event is intended to support and help Member States in developing and adopting the PPP model.   Registration: You may participate in both events, or choose the one you wish to attend, by checking the tick boxes on the online registration form.

ENISA_PR_1057	2012-03-23	PR	Privacy-a fundamental right-between economics and practice 	    ENISA launches two reports with recommendations on personal data protection. Privacy is recognised within the EU as a fundamental right, but what is the current economic reality? Are online customers willing to pay for privacy? Do individuals value their privacy enough to pay more to service providers that protect their information better? The ‘Study on monetising privacy - An economic model for pricing personal information’ is the world's biggest study of privacy economics and  ‘connects the dots’ between the interaction of personalisation, privacy concerns and competition between online service providers. Consumers benefit from personalisation of products, but might also be ‘locked-in’ to services. Moreover, personalisation bears a privacy risk, i.e. that data may be compromised once disclosed to a service provider. The ENISA study’s experimental results reveal that a vast majority of the experiment’s participants, up to 83%, chose to pay a ‘premium’ for privacy. They did so to avoid disclosure of more personal data. The cases focus on registration to social networking sites, on online ticket booking in the transportation sector and the collection of customer data and retention of traffic data in the telecommunications sector. These cases form the background for an analysis of the principle of minimal disclosure (when collecting personal data) and the principle of minimal storage period (when storing data), and the fundamental EU-principle of proportionality.  The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, comments: “Our ‘Study on data collection and storage in the EU’ is a pivoting point for a pan-European view on the rules on collection and storage of personal data in the EU.” The studies recommendations conclude that: the Member States should identify and eliminate conflicting personal data provisions; the national Data Protection Authorities should provide clear guidelines to data controllers; and to the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, the European Data Protection Supervisor and ENISA to do the same when processing personal data with pan-European impact; and the Data Protection Authorities should improve user awareness regarding the rights stemming from the data protection legislation and how to exercise these rights, in cases of excessive collection and storage of personal data.   The findings of the studies will be discussed at the Cyber Security & Privacy EU Forum, ENISA’s panel, 24/04 in Berlin. This work was conducted in collaboration with ABC4Trust, and is in line with the new EU data protection regulation.   Background: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/it/library/deliverables/monetising-privacy http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/it/library/deliverables/data-collection For interviews: Ulf Bergstrom, Spokesman, ENISA, press@enisa.europa.eu, Mobile: + 30 6948 460 143 or, Rodica Tirtea, Expert, ENISA, rodica.tirtea Qenisa.europa.eu.

ENISA_NEWS_1062	2012-02-23	NEWS	For a smarter future; Smart Grids-workshop	 What are smart grids? Smart grids are the future for more efficient electricity distribution. A smart grid is an umbrella term that covers modernisation of both the transmission and electronic distribution grids. An electrical grid is not a single element, but an aggregate of multiple networks and multiple power generation operators, with varying degree of communication and coordination. Smart grids increase the connectivity, automation and coordination between these suppliers, consumers and networks for long distance transmission or local distribution tasks. This reduces costs, increases safety, and make the energy consumption smarter. Yet, it is a challenge to make sure these modern systems are reliable, and resilient against attacks. Consequences of smart grids Smart Grid will facilitate greater customer participation, allow for all types and sizes of generation, provide adequate power quality, efficiency, security and reliability, and will create opportunities for new services and market integration. They will dramatically change the electricity grid as we know it today. Traditional energy services and markets will undergo a significant transformation, which will evolve the role of customers – they will be efficient energy consumers and electricity producers (so called – prosumers) at the same time. Focussing on smart grids; forthcoming workshop in Brussels. The Agency is arranging a workshop in Brussels, on Wednesday 29/02, engaging all stakeholders on the subject of cyber security challenges of Smart Grids. The workshop constitutes a backdrop for input to the forthcoming ENISA Smart Grid Security Study, due for publication in March, 2012. This study will give a comprehensive ‘panorama’ of current Smart Grid challenges and initiatives in- and outside Europe.

This gives consumers a better idea of the information, products and services being provided. However, by using reputation systems, citizens place themselves at additional risk. These privacy risks include: - exposing personal data - facilitating the targeting of advertising against themselves - risking price discrimination - website providers sharing the reputation data they provide - the level of trust placed in the reputation score exceeding the actual level of trust-worthiness - vendors and service providers monitoring reputation systems for poor reputation scores to identity and rectify potential customer issues - the linking of user identities across multiple sites through the use of advanced analytics. This study revealed a significant difference between the real-life implementation of reputation systems and current academic research. The reputation systems being deployed are primarily concerned with facilitating and promoting business transactions. The academic research into privacy and trust solutions for reputation systems does not appear to be considered, in order to embed the research in operational systems.

Professor Helmbrecht said: “ENISA has taken a number of initiatives in recent months to help us focus on improving IT security. For example, earlier this year, we created our Mobile Assistance Team, which helps us to work more closely with our stakeholders across EU Member States. The visit from Mr Mavroudis and his party was an excellent opportunity for us to share these latest developments with him and his group, and discuss how we can collaborate more closely to enhance network and information security for all of Europe’s citizens.” Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_1072	2011-12-21	NEWS	"New report published on ""Economics of Security"""	 Currently there are discussions at the international level on the issue of Economics of Security, which has resulted in several studies and analyses. ENISA has collected and analysed the existing knowledge available in order to avoid duplication of work and create a solid view of the complex issue of “Economics of Security”. For this purpose, experts in this area have been contacted and their views on open issues in the area of Economics of Security have been assessed. Once the analysis exercise was completed, ENISA identified key issues that need to be addressed in the short term. As part of this work, ENISA identified particular stakeholders affected by this challenging environment, such as the consumers, industry and state. Subsequently identified and analysed the ways they are affected and possible ways to address their concerns. In order to do this effectively, we established a multidisciplinary working group, comprising of economists, technical experts, economists and representatives of industry. The final report can be found here.

ENISA_PR_1073	2011-12-20	PR	First EU-report on Maritime Cyber Security	 Cyber threats are a growing menace, spreading to all industry sectors that are relying on ICT systems. Recent deliberate disruptions of critical automation systems, such as Stuxnet, prove that cyber-attacks have a significant impact on critical infrastructures. Disruption of these ICT capabilities may have disastrous consequences for the EU Member States’ governments and social wellbeing. The need to ensure ICT robustness against cyber-attacks is thus a key challenge at national and pan-European level. Some key findings of the report; Maritime cyber security awareness is currently low, to non-existent. Member States are thus highly recommended to undertake targeted maritime sector awareness raising campaigns and cyber security training of shipping companies, port authorities, national cyber security offices, etc. Due to the high ICT complexity, it is major challenge to ensure adequate maritime cyber security. A common strategy and development of good practices for the technology development and implementation of ICT systems would therefore ensure “security by design” for all critical maritime ICT components. As current maritime regulations and policies consider only physical aspects of security and safety, policy makers should add cyber security aspects to them. We strongly recommend a holistic, risk-based approach; assessment of maritime specific cyber risks, as well as identification of all critical assets within this sector. As maritime governance is fragmented between different levels (i.e. international, European, national), the International Maritime Organisation together with the EU Commission and the Member States should align international and EU policies in this sector. Better information exchange and statistics on cyber security can help insurers to improve their actuarial models, reduce own risks, and thus offering better contractual insurance conditions for the maritime sector. Information exchange platforms, such as CPNI.NL, should be also considered and by Member States to better communications.   The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht comments;“This report positions maritime cyber security as a logical and crucial next step in the global protection efforts of ICT infrastructure.”   Maritime figures • 90% of the EU’s external trade and more than 40% of the internal trade take place via maritime routes.Consequently, securing the maritime sector’s critical infrastructure and the movement of vital goods, e.g. food and health supplies, is a priority area for Europe.

ENISA_PR_1074	2011-12-19	PR	 Industrial Control Systems Security: Recommendations for Europe & Member States 	 ENISA, the EU’s ‘cyber security’ agency, has today issued the results of a study on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) security. The report describes the current situation on ICS security and proposes seven recommendations for improving it. Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are command and control networks and systems designed to support industrial processes. These systems are used for monitoring and controlling a variety of processes and operation, such as gas and electricity distribution, water, oil refining and railway transportation. In the last decade, these systems have faced a notable number of incidents. These include the “Stuxnet” attack, which is believed to have used bespoke malware to target nuclear control systems in Iran, and the recent DuQu-‘upgraded variant’ of this malware. These incidents caused great security concerns among ICS users.   In 2011, ENISA has worked on the main concerns regarding ICS security, and national, pan European and international initiatives on ICS security. The stakeholders involved include ICS security tools and services providers, ICS software/hardware manufacturers, infrastructure operators, public bodies, standardisation bodies, academia and R&D. This final report proposes seven practical, useful recommendations to public and private sector ICS-actors, as to improve current initiatives and enhance co-operation. The recommendations call for the creation of national and pan-European ICS security strategies, a Good Practice Guide on ICS security, research activities, the establishment of a common test bed and ICS-computer emergency response capabilities.   “Real security for Industrial Control Systems can be only achieved with a common effort, characterised by cooperation, knowledge exchange and mutual understanding of all involved stakeholders,” says Rafal Leszczyna, editor of the report.   Professor Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA added;“Stuxnet brought the problem of security of industrial control systems to prominence. Our study clearly shows that there is still a lot to be done in this area by all relevant stakeholders. We hope that our seven recommendations will lead to significant improvement.”   Background: To address ICS security, in April 2007, the Council of the European Union adopted a European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP). The key element of EPCIP is the Directive on the identification and designation of European Critical Infrastructures. In parallel, the information security issues for vital infrastructures in Europe are addressed by The Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE) and the CIIP Action Plan. The ENISA study results were validated during a workshop in Barcelona, in September, 2011.

ENISA_PR_1075	2011-12-16	PR	Protecting cyber space: Achieving effective cross border information exchange between Computer Emergency Response Teams	" The Agency has published a study into legal and regulatory aspects of information sharing and cross-border collaboration of national/governmental Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) in Europe. The report analyses what effects these aspects have on cross border information sharing between CERTs. The conclusion is that there exists a delicate balance of investigating, managing and mitigating computer incidents, whilst respecting rights and obligations provided for by certain legal and regulatory frameworks, including data protection and privacy provisions. CERTs are crucial in cross border co-ordination of computer incidents and in order to perform their important role they need to exchange information. Cross border information exchange requires complex legal factors to be considered. CERTs in different countries have differing legal grounds to request from and transmit information to other teams. Furthermore, the information exchanged might be personal data and therefore subject to specific privacy provisions. In addition, CERTs, including national/governmental CERTs, have varying mandates. The study identifies these legal and regulatory factors, and performs an assessment of what effects they have on cross-border information sharing between CERTs. Among others, one of the findings of this study is that, in practice, data protection, data retention, and obligations to work with law enforcement are the greatest challenges for cross-border CERT co-operation. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, comments: ""CERTS have to perform a delicate balancing act between investigating, managing, and mitigating incidents, and at the same time protecting privacy, data, and integrity. Clearly, cross border exchange of information should not be considered as a risk to fundamental rights, as exchanges are a precondition for effective response to cyber ICT incidents, as well as to protect these very rights. Poor cyber security can in effect undermine the exercise of your human rights.” Samples of medium/long term policy intervention recommendations include: Clarification of the differences between national legal frameworks; Adoption of EU legislation that takes account of the scope of national/governmental CERTs;  Specification of a threshold for incidents requiring national/governmental CERT response & information sharing; Explanation of why CERTs need to process personal data for relevant authorities to establish clarity under what circumstances this data may be shared across borders; Inclusion of information on the legal basis for information requests.

ENISA_PR_1077	2011-12-15	PR	ENISA looks at a European Cyber Security Month	 In the report, ENISA looks at the benefits of a “’European Security Month”. The study takes a close look at 127 cyber security events organised at national level across Europe and how to engage EU Member States. The aim is to increase awareness among EU citizens of risks to personal, corporate and national security and to demonstrate practical steps to protect sensitive information. Around 50% of the EU member states already run their own, national security days or, usually, weeks. But a pan-European campaign would coordinate the approach and the messages, as well as broaden their scope, by including public and private security industry actors. The security month would draw on the worldwide experiences to create a strong brand, and to deliver clear, powerful messages through a wide range of channels, including websites, advertising, media coverage, videos, TV and radio broadcasts. The report does not however suggest a fixed month across Europe, as the campaigns currently held by Member States span various months identified to mainly occur in Q3/Q4. The report does however suggest that synchronising the month with the US cyber security month (in October) could to “jump start” the process. The report includes a roadmap and strategy to bring together national groups and decision makers. “With threats at home and work through fixed and mobile computing devices, higher awareness levels can really reduce the number of cyber security breaches,” said Professor Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA. “While this report recognises the challenges to deliver an EU-wide campaign, notably to make the Month fun and exciting, a successful ‘European Security Month’ will reduce the number of incidents, increase consumer’s confidence and help protect children and adults using Internet.” The EU’s Digital Agenda for Europe stipulates that the EU should undertake a European security month in 2012. This would increase knowledge of Network and Information Security (NIS) issues, modify perceptions of threats, and provide updated security information through education, good practices and competitions.

ENISA_PR_1078	2011-12-13	PR	 Clarifying cyber security incident reporting: guidelines on how to implement the new telecom legislation on security & integrity “Art 13a”.	 The new telecommunications legislation (EU directive 2009/140/EC) among other things offers protection for consumers against security breaches. Article 13a of the new legislation requires telecoms operators to report security incidents and to take security measures to enable secure and uninterrupted delivery of communication services over European telecommunication networks.In 2010, ENISA, the European Commission (EC), Member States’ Ministries and Telecommunication national telecom regulatory authorities (NRAs), as the “Art13 Working Group” started work to bring clarity to the actual reporting, and to achieve a consistent implementation of Article 13a. This group of actors reached consensus on two guidelines: Technical guideline on cyber security incident reporting, and Technical guideline for minimum security measures.  “A clarification of how to report cyber incidents and how to implement article 13a in a consistent way provides a level playing field for the European telecom sector. This will remove the barriers for European telecommunications providers operating across borders.” say Dimitra Liveri and Marnix Dekker, editors of the two documents. “Incident reporting and minimal security measures are important tools to provide consumers, businesses and governments confidence in the security of telecommunication services. After the recent Diginotar case there is also growing support for broadening the scope of this kind of legislation beyond the telecom sector”, says Professor Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA. The guideline on incident reporting guides NRAs about two types of incident reporting mentioned in Article 13a: the annual summary reporting of significant incidents to ENISA and the EC, and ad hoc notification of incidents to other NRAs, in case of cross-border incidents. This guideline defines the scope of incident reporting, the incident parameters and thresholds. It also contains a reporting template for submitting incident reports to ENISA and the EC, and explains how reports will be processed by ENISA. The guideline for Minimum Security Measures advices NRAs on the minimum security measures that telecom operators should take to ensure security of these networks.

ENISA_PR_1081	2011-12-07	PR	Fighting cyber threats; Plugging the gaps. New report on proactive detection of cyber security incidents to make “digital fire-brigades” more effective	 The Agency today launches a report which identifies 16 shortcomings in detection of network security incidents. The report reveals that not all available tools are used widely enough by the ‘’digital fire-brigades’’, the Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) to effectively fight cyber threats. Therefore, the Agency issues 35 recommendations to data providers, data consumers, and at EU/national levels to mitigate the shortcomings. The study has identified that the CERTs are currently not fully utilizing all possible external sources at their disposal. Similarly, many CERTs neither collect, nor share incident data about other constituencies with other CERTs. This is concerning, as information exchange is key to effectively combating malware and malicious activities, which is extremely important in fighting cross-border cyber threats. Shortcomings The 16 shortcomings in detection of incidents are examined in depth. Top technical gaps include insufficient data quality (false positives in provided data, poor timeliness of delivery), lack of standard formats, tools, resources and skills. The most important legal problem involves privacy regulations and personal data protection laws that hinder information exchange. “National/government CERT managers should use the report to overcome identified shortcomings, by using more external sources of incident information, and additional internal tools to collect information to plug the gaps” says the Agency Executive Director, Professor Udo Helmbrecht. 35 recommendations to mitigate the shortcomings For data providers, the key recommendations focus on how to better reach CERTs, better data format, distribution, as well as data quality improvement. For data consumers, they include additional activities by a CERT to verify the quality of data feeds, and specific deployments of new technologies recommended. Finally, at the EU or national level balancing of the privacy protection and security needs is necessary, as well as facilitating the adoption of common formats, integration of statistical incident data, and research into data leakage reporting. Background: Proactive detection of incidents is the discovery of malicious activity, before the complaints and incident reports about it are received. As such, it is a cornerstone for an efficient CERT services portfolio. It can greatly boost a CERT’s efficiency in operations, thus strengthening CERT’s Incident Handling capability which is one of the core services of national / governmental CERTs.

ENISA_PR_1092	2011-11-11	PR	Life-logging & online personal data; the effects on privacy, economy, society & people’s psychology; in new report; “To log or not to log?” 	"   ENISA is looking ahead to 2014 to predict positive and negative effects of online, ""life-logging"" on citizens and society. In a new report, “To log or not to log? Risks and benefits of emerging life-logging technologies,” the Agency uses a fictional family’s day-to-day lives, and examines the impact for their privacy, the “family wallet”, psychology, etc., as they put ever more personal information online. It includes recommendations towards addressing security and privacy risks. For citizens across Europe, the benefits of sharing information through social media, access goods and services via new applications are immense. Families and friends can stay in touch, and government services can be accessed through new applications. The report examines both advantages and risks of people’s increasing use of online applications. But to use the benefits, people need to upload personal information; be it personal thoughts, videos, or financial data, to internet locations over which they have little control. For individuals, that implies threats to privacy, loss of personal data control, harm to your reputation and the possibility of psychological damage from exclusion or the feeling of constant surveillance. For commercial organisations, there is the risk of breaching data protection laws, resulting in legal sanctions and irreversible damage to reputation. Governments may suffer losses of public confidence if they are perceived not to be properly protecting their citizens’ personal information. Commenting on the report, the Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, said: “The original feature of our report is that it proves how information security risks impacts several aspects of citizens and society; it connects the benefits of life-logging, while considering privacy and data protection aspects too.” Recommendations include: •    For the European Commission; to use the report in the current       revision of the data protection directive and to promote security and      privacy risk management as a framework,•    For governments; to create a regulatory environment with incentives      for privacy-aware devices and services to support competition,      interoperability, and to introduce sanctions for personal data breaches•    For service providers; to consider the security/privacy impacts of new       services, and to use strong security controls to protect individuals’       personal data.

ENISA_PR_1093	2011-11-08	PR	New report: Cyber bullying & online grooming: 18 protective recommendations against key risks	   The EU Agency ENISA, the (European Network and Information Security Agency) has launched a new report on cyber bullying and online grooming (preparing sexual abuse); warning that misuse of data (data mining and profiling) harms minors. The report identifies the top emerging risks and makes 18 non-technical recommendations for their mitigation. One key recommendation is to strengthen Member State’s law enforcement agencies. Other recommendations point to safeguards adapted to the needs of youth’s cyber activities. Digital devices and the internet now play a significant role in children’s lives. Today’s young people live their online lives in both private and educational settings. This is an environment radically different from that of their parents, in their childhoods. Risks in a child’s online environment can be detrimental to their physical activities and social skills, argues the ENISA Expert Group on Internet risks. The Executive Director of ENISA, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht comments: “Our children run the risk of becoming victims of online grooming and cyber bullying; therefore actions are needed to protect teenagers’ cyber activities.”  The report details a scenario of 13-year old Kristie’s changed behaviour, poor grades and negative attitudes due to abuse in her online life. Many parents lose control, as they lack knowledge and tools to support their children, the report argues. The Agency thus issues 18 recommendationsto mitigate identified risks. Among the key recommendations are: Strengthening of law enforcement agencies by the Member States: additional knowledge and resources is important. This additional strength is needed to properly cover regulatory issues, statistical data collection of misuse cases, and follow up on privacy breaches Civil society and social partners need knowledge sourcesregarding the use of Internet and online services. Furthermore, sponsored online campaigns to prevent grooming/cyber bullying should take place in social networks. Parents/guardians/educators need better technological skillsto overcome the knowledge gap between adults and teenagers.For teenagers, the mitigation measures for the identified risks include:- Use of specialised teenager security settings,  and adaptation of  existing ones to teenager needs - Privacy impact assessment for applications processing teenager’s data - Development of mechanisms to allow deactivation of all active (online) components- Age oriented access control mechanisms - Among the top risks for teenagers, out of a total of 13 identified, are:suffering serious loss of physical or mental health; irreversibly exposing important personal information online; discrimination based on your online behaviour, and misuse of personal data. For full reportincluding all risks and recommendations to different target audiences.

ENISA_PR_1094	2011-11-03	PR	First joint EU-US cyber security exercise conducted today, 3rd Nov. 2011 	   In the first scenario, a targeted stealthy cyber-attack (Advanced Persistent Threat – APT) attempts to exfiltrate and publish online, secret information from EU Member States’ cyber security agencies. The second simulation focuses on the disruption of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems in power generation infrastructures. More than 20 EU Member States are involved in the exercise, 16 of them actively playing, with the European Commission providing high-level direction. Cyber Atlantic 2011 is part of an EU-US commitment to cyber security which was made at the EU-US summit in Lisbon on 20 November 2010.   The aims are to “tackle new threats to the global networks upon which the security and prosperity of our free societies increasingly depend.”   The exercise draws on lessons learned in the first pan-European cyber security “stress test” exercise, Cyber Europe 2010, which was facilitated last year by ENISA. ENISA’s role involves supporting EU Member States in organising cyber security exercises and formulating national contingency plans, with good practice guides and seminars. ENISA’s Executive Director, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, said: “It is an honour for ENISA to be facilitating this extremely important milestone in international cyber security cooperation. European Vice-President, Neelie Kroes, has spoken of the importance of information communications technology for today’s citizens and for the economy. The involvement of the Commission, EU Member States and, of course, the US, in today’s exercise shows the high level of commitment we have to ensuring that we protect our digital infrastructures for the benefit of all citizens.” Lessons learned from Cyber Atlantic 2011 will be used to plan further potential joint EU-US cyber exercises in the future.

ENISA_NEWS_1097	2011-10-13	NEWS	Summarising the Maritime Cyber Security Workshop	 Did you know that..? Ca 90% of the EU’s external trade and more than 43% of the internal trade take place via maritime routes. Industries and services in the maritime sector, contribute between 3-5% of EU Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and maritime regions produce more than 40 % of Europe’s GDP. 22 EU Member States with maritime borders manage more than 1.200 sea ports supporting the maritime sector activity; and three major European seaports (i.e. Rotterdam, Hamburg and Antwerp) accounted in 2010 for 8% of world traffic volume. ContextGiven the above figures, securing the maritime sector’s critical infrastructure and the movement of vital goods is a priority and area of concern for the key European stakeholders, including the European Commission, Member States and the private sector. Critical infrastructure in the maritime sector sustains essential services and the movement of vital goods. Adequate cyber security for maritime activities are thus so crucial that delays in the supply chain may even cause health problems in any Member State’s population.The Agency workshop e.g. included topics; An overview of the current EU policy, focussed at mitigating IT security risks for Europe. The SafeSeaNet initiative (i.e. critical information on cargo/crew/passengers transmitted when ships arrive to EU ports, using e-messages, which must be done in a secure way.) Recommendations on cyber security for the maritime sectorAs a result of the workshop, legal and recommendations include; The level of ICT implementation maturity strongly varies from one port to another, while security is not always a priority. Therefore, to achieve cyber security at port level, the implementation of ICT systems that are secure by design is needed. Awareness. To raise awareness at a practical level, relevant ship crews should obtain basic cyber security skills and training, with possible certifications for ship captains. Accesses to systems could also be restricted, with proper access controls. Top-down approach to implement cyber security (from authorities to ports) clarifying that assets are at risk, and the possible impacts of a cyber-security incident. Clear economic drivers must also be identified in order to attract and motivate the private sector. Moreover, the lack of information exchange on cyber security incidents and on other cyber related threats (e.g. fraud, e-crime, etc.) facing the maritime sector was highlighted.

ENISA_PR_1099	2011-10-11	PR	New Guide launched re: building effective IT Security Public Private Partnerships (PPPs)	" Across the EU, the critical infrastructure of most member States is in the hands of the private sector. Therefore, to provide secure and reliable system access for citizens and businesses, industry and governments must work together. The critical information infrastructures (CII) in Europe are fragmented, both geographically and because of competition among telecom operators. To overcome this fragmentation, Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) have evolved to protect the digital economy in many Member States, at different times, and under different legal frameworks. But this natural evolution means that there is no common definition of what constitutes a PPP. In a world where threats to infrastructure do not respect national borders, the European Network and Information Security Agency ENISA’s new PPPs Guide with 36 recommendations on how to successfully build a PPP, underlines the need for a common understanding across Europe. This is of particular importance for the European Public Private Partnership for Resilience (EP3R), a European Union initiative, which is liaising with national PPPs on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) issues. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht, comments: ""There is a need for a truly international, global approach to cyber security and Critical Information Infrastructure Protection. No country can create a CIIP strategy in isolation, as there are no national boundaries in cyber-space. PPPs are consequently one of the agenda items for the special EU-US Working Group on Cyber-Security and Cyber-Crime.” PPP taxonomyThe Guide classifies PPPs for security and resilience in three types: Prevention Focused, Response Focused and Umbrella PPPs. The Guide consolidates and validates a PPP-taxonomy, and gives advice in five main areas:•    Why a PPP should be created (scope/threats)•    Who should be involved (coverage, geographical/focus, interrelated links)•    How a PPP should be governed•    What services and incentives should be offered•    When a PPP should be created and other timing points The Guide draws on input from 30 questionnaires and 15 in-depth interviews with both public and private sector stakeholders across twenty countries. It also describes and maps PPPs from the USA, Canada and Australia, identifying critical success factors for information sharing, and ways forward for international collaboration.

ENISA_NEWS_1103	2011-09-20	NEWS	Industrial Control Systems (ICS) & SCADA Security Workshop	 ContextCritical infrastructures, such as power plants, transportation systems, oil and  chemical factories etc, are large, distributed complexes. Plant operators must continuously monitor and control many different sections of the plant to ensure its proper operation. During the last decades this remote command and control has been made feasible due to the development of networking technology and the advent of Industrial Control Systems (ICS). ICS are command and control networks and systems designed to support industrial processes. The largest subgroup of ICS is SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems. ICS development ICS are nowadays standard technologies, highly interconnected with other corporate networks and the Internet. Today, ICS products are mostly based on standard embedded systems platforms. These are applied in various devices, such as routers or cable modems, and they often use commercial off-the shelf software. All this has resulted in reduction of costs, ease of use and enabled the remote control and monitoring from various locations. However, an important drawback derived from the connection to intranets and communication networks, is the increased vulnerability to computer network-based attacks. Agency ICS Security actionRecognising the importance of these challenges, ENISA launched a series of activities, to bring the relevant stakeholders together to identify the main concerns regarding the security of ICS. Panorama study of ICS The Agency has done research and is preparing a survey-based study on ICS. The  study will provide a current ‘panorama’ of the ICS protection, threats, risks and challenges primarily in Europe, but also in the international context. Furthermore, it details pan-European and international initiatives on ICS security. Outline of the reportAlmost one hundred key findings have been identified and grouped into various thematic categories. It starts with the biggest challenges in ICS security, and continues with a multiplicity of topics on ICS security. This includes: •    standards, guidelines, and regulatory documentation,•    information sharing,•    public-private partnerships and other initiatives,•    dissemination and awareness,•    technical security aspects,•    present and future of research,•    pending debates and other related issues.Recommendations Based on the findings, recommendations to both the public and private sector are given. These recommendations provides practical advice to improve current initiatives, enhancing co-operation, developing new measures and good practices, and reducing barriers to information sharing. The recommendations will e.g. call for the creation of the national and pan-European ICS security strategies, the development of a Good Practices Guide on the ICS security, fostering awareness and education as well as research activities or the establishment of a common test bed. The final version of the report is expected for the delivery in the beginning of December, 2011. Study design highlights•    Over 50 questionnaires by top experts from all involved sectors analysed•    Almost 30 experts interviewed to obtain additional detailed information•    Over 30 guidelines, standards & regulatory documents compiled•    Over 60 initiatives identified•    Over 90 key findings derived•    Over 100 information sources consulted Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_1104	2011-09-15	NEWS	Getting the right concept by using the right words: obtaining a common glossary for resilience 	" Context of resilience, ontology & taxonomyIn 2009 ENISA published a report on gaps in standardisation related to resilience of communication networks. It highlighted the lack of a consistent taxonomy for cyber security that identifies the role of resilience. As a result, in 2011 ENISA launched a project with the objective of defining both an ontology and taxonomies of resilience. These should be used as the basis of further work in technical standardisation of means for providing and management of resilient networks, which will be discussed  at a workshop in Brussels, 17, Oct. What is missing?Existing standards in the field have so far only addressed resilience indirectly. Therefore, they have been without detailed definition of the taxonomy and thus of the semantics of security. As metrics play a significant role in giving a meaning to any comparison of system resilience. It is therefore essential that they are normalised and promoted. The primary purpose of an ontology and taxonomies defined in this context is to use them as the basis of definitions and processes in the future work. Ultimately, the intent is to use them as mandatory standards to be followed for all network based resilience measures.Definition of Taxonomy A taxonomy is most often defined as a classification of terms and has close a relationship with the use of ontology. There are three characteristics that define a taxonomy: A form of classification scheme to group related things together and to define the relationship these things have to each other. A semantic vocabulary to describe knowledge and information assets. A knowledge map to give users an immediately grasp of the overall structure of the knowledge domain covered by the taxonomy, which should be comprehensive, predictable and easy to navigate. How do you define resilience? Resilience is a also known as ‘Critical Infrastructure and Information Protection’ (CIIP) and a key task for the Agency. By the use of the term resilient, we characterise the networks that provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in face of faults (unintentional, intentional, or naturally caused) affecting their normal operation. The main aim of the resilience is for faults to be invisible to users. What's an ontology? In computer science and information science, an ontology formally represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain, and the relationships between those concepts. ActionAgainst this background, the Agency and the European Commission Directorate General Information Society and Media (DG INFSO)’s Unit ""Trust and Security"" are jointly organising this workshop. The objective is to provide a platform for the exchange of ideas on this subject; including: Impact of resilience on standardisation activities for future networks; The regulator viewpoint: Why resilience is critical? The network operator viewpoint: Addressing resilience at network planning/dimensioning stage; The manufacturer viewpoint: How resilient equipment strategies impact innovation; Technological and research challenges: damaged networks recovery techniques; preservation of privacy in a network stress event.

ENISA_PR_1105	2011-09-13	PR	New report: App-store security– the 'five lines of defence'	" The booming smartphone industry has a special way of delivering software to end-users: app-stores. Popular app-stores have hundreds of thousands of apps for anything from online banking to mosquito repellent, and the most popular stores (e.g. Apple App-store, Google Android market) claim billions of app downloads.   But app-stores have not escaped the attention of cyber attackers. Over the course of 2011 numerous malicious apps were found, targeting a variety of smartphone models. Dr Marnix Dekker and Dr Giles Hogben, authors of the report say: “Using malicious apps, attackers can easily tap into the vast amount of private data processed on smartphones such as confidential business emails, location data, phone calls, SMS messages and so on. Consumers are hardly aware of this.”   “Five lines of defence” to secure app-stores Starting from a threat model for app-stores, the paper identifies what it calls “the five lines of defence” that must be in place to secure app stores from malware: app review, reputation, kill-switches, device security and jails. “This report provides a very practical and technical analysis of malware threats for app-stores in under 20 pages. The Agency has made an excellent choice of security techniques, and the recommendations are ready-to-use,” says Raoul Chiesa, an Italian ethical hacker and cybersecurity expert.   Without overlooking the differences between the various smartphone models and app-stores, ENISA recommends an industry-wide approach to addressing insecure and malicious apps. “The number of malware attacks direct at smartphones still pales in comparison to PCs. This paper is a blueprint for how to maintain this head-start and address security across app-stores."" says Professor Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA.

ENISA_NEWS_1106	2011-08-26	NEWS	Maritime Cyber Security Workshop in Brussels	 The Agency will arrange a Maritime Cyber SecurityWorkshop in Brussels, end of September, 28/09 ContextCritical infrastructure in the maritime sector sustains services and the movement of vital goods. This includes energy (transportation of oil and gas) and food.  These transports are so crucial that their unavailability or delays in their supply chain may adversely affect the well-being of any Member State population. 22 Member States with maritime border manage more than 1.200 sea ports supporting the maritime sector activity. Three major European seaports (i.e. Rotterdam, Hamburg and Antwerp) accounted in 2010 for 8% of overall world traffic volume, representing over 27,52 Million-TEUs. Additionally, these seaports handled more than 50% of the entire European waterborne foreign container trade. The main European seaports carried in 2009 17,2% of the international exports and 18% of the imports, the European economy is consequently critically dependent upon the maritime movement of cargo and passengers. Around 90% of EU external trade and more than 43% of the internal trade take place via maritime routes. Industries and services belonging to the maritime sector, contribute between 3 and 5 % of EU Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and maritime regions produce more than 40 % of Europe‟s GDP. Securing the critical infrastructure of the maritime sector and the movement of vital goods has become a priority and area of concern for the key European stakeholders, including the European Commission, Member State governments and the main actors from the private sector. Maritime cyber security action In this context, ENISA took the lead in analysing the key ICT dependencies and cyber security aspects relevant for the maritime sector and organizes a workshop to engage all relevant stakeholders in discussing: • Cyber security challenges in the Maritime Sector (dependencies of ICT in general and some high level risks); Critical infrastructures are highly interconnected and mutually dependent in complex ways. Commercial maritime companies are increasingly supporting this demand. Also the maritime sectors provides a wide range of products and services around information technology and communication systems, with a high degree of automation and reliability. For example, self-unloading applications are deployed and operated worldwide. The automations can be found in Industrial Control System, or ICS infrastructure for the maritime sector. • National European and international initiatives related to cyber security aspects in the Maritime Sector; The European Parliament provides requirements and the applicable security principles for the SafeSeaNet system in its Directive 2002/59/EC. Directive 2010/65/EU provides basic requirements on the electronic transmission of data, exchange of data and confidentiality of the information exchanged through the various systems of the maritime sector. • Standardisation and regulation (certification) initiatives related to the cyber security aspects in the Maritime Sector in the EU and outside EU.ReportThe outcome of this workshop will be integrated into an ENISA study on this topic, ''Cyber Security aspects in the Maritime Sector''. The report is due approx. in October 2011 and will give a current ‘panorama’ of the Cyber dependencies of ICT in the Maritime Sector both in Europe and in an international context. Several stakeholders have been invited to take part in the study: the European Commission, industry and maritime service providers, public bodies in the Member States, standardisation bodies as well as regulators.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_1109	2011-08-01	PR	 Web security: EU cyber-security Agency ENISA flags security fixes for new web standards/HTML5	 At a critical moment in the development of HTML5, the new core standard for the web, ENISA today proposes important security fixes for 13 upcoming web standards. ENISA has identified 50 security threats and proposed how they should be addressed. Banking, social networking, shopping, navigation, card payments and even managing critical infrastructures such as power networks – almost any activity you can imagine now takes place within a browser window. “The web browser is now one of the most security-critical components in our information infrastructure - an increasingly lucrative target for cyber-attackers,” comments Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA. To accommodate innovations in web applications and their business models and to enable more people to use the web, W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium) is currently working on major revisions to its core standards. The 'point-of-no-return' ENISA has seized this opportunity to review the specifications and propose improvements to enhance browser security for all users. “Many of these specifications are reaching a point-of-no-return. For once, we have the opportunity to think deeply about security – before the standard is set in stone, rather than trying to patch it up afterwards. This is a unique opportunity to build in security-by-design,” says Giles Hogben, co-editor of the report. “We welcome this very timely security review by ENISA. We have encouraged ENISA to report the issues they have identified to the relevant W3C Working Groups,” says Thomas Roessler, W3C security lead. The ENISA analysis reveals 50 security threats and issues including: •    Unprotected access to sensitive information•    New ways to trigger form-submission to attackers•    Problems in specifying and enforcing security policies•    Potential mismatches with Operating System permission management•    Underspecified features, potentially leading to conflicting or error-prone implementations.•    New ways to escape access control mechanisms and protection from “click-jacking” (tricking the user into clicking on dangerous links and buttons) “An important conclusion of this study is that significantly fewer security issues were found in those specifications which have already undergone detailed security review. This demonstrates the value of in-depth security reviews of up-coming specifications,” says Marnix Dekker, report co-editor.

Updated and extended for this third edition, “Country Reports” features an overview and detailed, separate reports on 30 European countries. Information includes identification of stakeholders and trends. A key finding is that no pattern exists in the observed European countries with respect to the existence of a national NIS strategy. However, many countries are enhancing their efforts and making progress in this area. Information exchange mechanisms and cooperation amongst key stakeholders also vary from country to country. Successful NIS initiatives – are outlined as blueprints for others to consider. Areas examined include security incident management and reporting, risk management and emerging risks, network resilience, privacy and trust, and awareness raising. “Country Reports” offers a unique overview of the current NIS landscape in the 27 EU Member States and the three European Economic Area countries [EEA: Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway], without comparing them individually with each other, given the different historical origins of NIS structures in these states. Each national report outlines: the individual country’s NIS strategy, regulatory framework and major policy measures; key stakeholders and their mandate, role and responsibilities. They provide an overview of the main NIS activities, stakeholders’ interactions; information exchange mechanisms, co-operation platforms, and country-specific facts, trends, and good practices case studies. The Executive Director of ENISA, Professor Udo Helmbrecht comments: ""This new edition of “Country Reports” provides an essential overview of the NIS landscape and structures in all the EU and EEA Member States.

ENISA_NEWS_1119	2011-06-06	NEWS	World IPv6 Day -8th June; time to take action & switch to the future	 What is IPv6? All computers and other IT devices that are connected to the web use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. The final available addresses of the most currently used Internet Protocol version, IPv4, were distributed at the end of February this year. Therefore, many of the big, commercial giants are now finally mobilising for the future. Facebook, YouTube, Google, et al, are all switching over to IPv6 and will all go live with it on the same day; the World IPv6 Day, 8th June, organised by the Internet Society. ENISA supports the World IPv6 Day, and encourages more companies, authorities and organisations to take action and start using IPv6. IPv6 is a technical leap. It’s main purpose is to increase the number of addresses that can be made available, thereby allowing the Internet to continue to grow. Furthermore, it offers many technological advantages, which are likely to have a significant impact in the network security and economic areas. IPv6 will be a key driver for many new mobile and wireless applications and services. It is an essential technology for implementing ambient intelligence or the ‘Internet of Things’ that enables electronic devices to communicate with each other. The Executive Director, Prof Udo Helmbrecht comments:“ENISA actively supports Europe’s objective to widely implement IPv6, and to take advantage of the technological and resiliency features of the new protocol.” ENISA was the first EU-Agency to go live with IPv6 already in 2009, as reported in http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/enisa-1st-eu-agency-with-ipv6   What can IPv6 give you? In 2008, ENISA conducted an assessment of IPv6, regarding its potential to provide increased network resilience.

Commissioner Neelie Kroes also considered the agreement a success: ""I welcome the Council's agreement this morning to extend the current mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) by 18 months. ENISA is a key instrument in tackling the cyber-security issues that needs to be efficient and given improved working conditions to respond to future challenges."" For full Council pressrelease Hungarian EU- Presidency reporting on the matter; Interview with Mr Zsolt Nyitrai,Hungarian Minister of State for Information and Communication; ""The aims of the Presidency are arranged around the keywords of strategy, safety and spectrum. It is one of the key elements of the programme of the Hungarian Presidency to check whether European citizens trust the network well enough to rely on it, even for their bank card transactions. Thinking further, this is not only a security issue, but also a matter of competitiveness. And in the creation of network security, the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), is one of the most important actors. Concerning the upgrade of the Agency’s operation the Presidency has taken a large step forward during the first half of the year, since it has submitted several compromise proposals to the working group, which take into account the positions expressed by the delegations. On the one hand, we have reached a theoretical agreement on the tasks of the upgraded ENISA, and on the other hand, we have also managed to agree on the bodies of the agency. Thirdly, we have made progress in designing the work and operation of ENISA. The term of the mandate of the Agency, seems to be the only issue open. In September 2011, the European Parliament is expected to express an opinion on the Agency’s modernisation, so the work will continue during the Polish Presidency. Naturally we will provide all the assistance they need. The most important thing is that ENISA work should continue. The current mandate of ENISA will expire in March 2012, therefore, it had to be extended by at least 18 months more. The Hungarian Presidency managed to ensure that the European Parliament and the Council reached a first reading agreement on the relevant proposal of the Commission, and we expect that the Council will accept it on 27 May. This will ensure ENISA’s operation to continue until the agreement is concluded in term of modernisation too.

It determines three essential NRM processes that need to be implemented by national governments, as follows: •    Process 1: Define NRM Policy.•    Process 2: Coordinate and Support Implementation [of risk management in CII stakeholder organisations].•    Process 3: Review, Reassess and Report [on NRM].Each of these three processes is supported by a number of activities. The report identifies a total of twelve detailed activities. These activities include among others; to set the vision, establish the NRM organisation, promote standards, create awareness, as well as to analyse errors and incidents. The framework for the governance of NRM enables governments and other national CII stakeholders to gain an overview of the elements that are required to build such a programme; and to understand the relationships between these elements. The guidelines feature a questionnaire that allows governments to assess their strengths and weaknesses in relation to NRM preparedness by using a use a five-level capability maturity measurement. The report can be used in practice by national governments to:•    Identify strengths and weaknesses in the implementation of NRM in their  Member State;•    Assist in the development of a framework for the governance of NRM;•    Help the government to assist CII stakeholder organisations in developing their own risk management processes; and •    Assess the Member State's NRM preparedness through the use of a defined testing process.

ENISA_PR_1128	2011-05-04	PR	The Internet Interconnection ‘ecosystem’ - new report identifies top risks for resilient interconnection of IT networks	 A new report on the resilience of the Internet interconnection 'ecosystem’ is launched by the EU’s ‘cyber security’ Agency ENISA (the European Network and Information Security Agency). The focus of this report is the complex ‘ecosystem’ of the interconnected network layers that make up the Internet. The report identifies a number of concerns, for example by unveiling a striking lack of information of the size and shape of the Internet infrastructure. The study also recommends that incidents should be investigated by an independent body in order to understand the nature of success and failures. The Internet has so far been extremely resilient; even major disasters such as “9/11”, has had only a local impact. But will this last? Now, a systemic failure of the Internet would cause significant problems for several sectors like energy, transport, finance, healthcare and the economy. Intentional, unilateral unavailability of Internet presents a real threat to economic and social welfare and can severely affect  the right of citizens to have access to information and services as the recent EU Joint Communication COM(2011)200 highlights. The Internet has no central Network Operation Centre. The open and decentralised organisation is the very essence of the ecosystem and is essential for the success and resilience of the Internet. Yet, there are a number of concerns; •    The Internet is vulnerable to technical failures, risks, cyber attacks and simultaneous disruptions; service could be substantially disrupted by other failures e.g. in the electricity supply•    There is remarkably little information about the size and shape of the Internet infrastructure or its daily operation. •    Dependability and economics interact in potentially pernicious ways, leading to a potential ‘tragedy of the commons’ for the interconnections ecosystem. “The stability of the Internet is critical for the economy of modern societies, therefore we must identify if the resilience mechanisms in place today will be effective also in future crises of tomorrow”, says Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA.The report examines whether the resilience mechanisms in place will be effective also in the future, and the Agency proposes a number of recommendations to ensure this, e.g.; •    Incidents investigations should be conducted by an independent body in order to understand the nature of success and failures;•    Key research is needed in e.g. inter-domain routing, traffic engineering, traffic redirection and prioritisation, especially during a crisis;•    Good practices should be identified and followed, e.g., diverse service provision (pluralism), auditing practices and independent testing of equipment and protocols.

ENISA_PR_1131	2011-04-18	PR	EU Agency ENISA issues final report & video clip on 'Cyber Europe 2010': the 1st pan- European cyber security exercise	 The European Union’s cyber security agency, ENISA has issued the final report on the first Pan-European  cyber security exercise for public bodies, ‘Cyber Europe 2010’. The report underlines a need for: •    more cyber security exercises in the future,•     increased collaboration between the Member States,•     the importance of the private sector in ensuring security. Supporting EU-wide cyber security preparedness exercises is an EU priority in  its ‘Digital Agenda for Europe’, as to ensure that businesses and citizens are secure online.  The Agency also released an online video clip to support the report. 'Cyber Europe 2010' was conducted on the 4th of November 2010. Its objective  was to trigger communication and collaboration between countries to respond to large-scale cyber-attacks. Over 70 Experts from the participating public bodies worked together to counter +300 simulated hacking  attacks aimed at  paralysing the Internet and critical online services across Europe. During the exercise, a simulated loss of Internet connectivity between the countries took place,  requiring cross border cooperation to avoid a ( simulated)  total network crash. The evaluation of the exercise was conducted at three levels:1.    National 2.    Pan-European 3.    Overall Key findings include that:•    Member States Information Technology bodies communicate in a wide variety of ways. Harmonisation of standard operating procedures would lead to more secure and efficient communication between them. •    The ability to find the relevant points of contact within organisations varied. In the event of a real crisis, some 55 % of countries were not confident they would be able to quickly identify the right contact, even with the available directories.•    Participants were evenly divided  on whether a  ‘Single Point of Contact’ (SPOC) or ‘Multiple Points of Contact’ (MPOC) would be better. A SPOC would be easier, but realistically, today there are multiple points of contact. MPOC also avoids a single point of failure. The main recommendations include that:•    Europe should continue to hold exercises in Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP): 86% of the participants found the ‘dry run’ ‘very’ or ‘extremely’ useful.•    The private sector should  provide value in future exercises by increasing  levels of realism •    ‘Lessons Identified’ should be exchanged with those holding other (national or international) exercises•    Member States should be well organised internally,  for example, by developing and testing national contingency plans and exercises: European countries are organised nationally in a variety of ways. Given the differences in structures and process, it is vital to know whom to contact. The dialogue on the necessity of Single Point of Contact or Multiple Points of Contact at the EU level should continue, and ENISA can be the facilitator of this. •    A roadmap for pan-EU exercises should be created. This would include  a definition of standard procedures and structures for large scale events.   “The Cyber Europe  report identifies how we can make our online economic and social activity more secure. ENISA is dedicated to supporting European exercises, processes and plans to protect the Information Communications Technology  infrastructure on which  we are all increasingly dependent, ”  says Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA.

ENISA_NEWS_1132	2011-04-18	NEWS	Helmbrecht; 'Cooperation on Incident Response is needed'	 The Agency Executive Director Prof. Udo Helmbrecht delivered the keynote at the Telecom Ministerial Conference on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP), organised by the Hungarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union in Balatonfüred, Hungary, on 15th April 2011. Mr Helmbrecht began by stating that “Information and communication technologies have become the backbone of our economy and society. On a global scale, societies are interconnected by information technology - and are irreversibly dependant on it. Unfortunately global threats have also become possible and very real.” He stressed that “Cooperation and communication are key to ensuring a successful response to an eventual cyber-attack or other large-scale disruption of ICT systems. This needs to be organised at a global level to be able to fight and mitigate security threats which cut across borders and legal jurisdictions effectively.” He also pointed out that on a pan-European level several important first steps to improve our cyber security have already been made. Several of which are described in the recent communication on CIIP from the Commission, and that ENISA is playing a key role in facilitating much of this activity, and will continue to do so. He further said, “ENISA is working to secure Europe’s information society. A great part of this is to protect our critical information infrastructure and the applications that run on top of it, and in parallel we have to reinforce incident response. Only then can growth and prosperity continue to be possible in a competition-oriented, globalised world.” The Executive Director concluded that “International cooperation on incident response is by no means an easy task, and may require agreement on international rules of conduct, standards and norms. However, it is necessary if the international community is to be able to protect cyberspace.” The full speech may be downloaded here See also the Hungarian Minister of State  for Infocommunication, Mr Zsolt Nyitriay's web site and summary of the event.   Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_NEWS_1135	2011-04-06	NEWS	Signing Ceremony of the Privacy and Data Protection Impact Assessment Framework for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Applications	 Vice President Commissioner Kroes attended this historic event, as well as the Agency Executive Director, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, who co-signed the framework, as the Agency has participated actively in the process leading up to the agreement.   This work has been done in close cooperation with  the industry and the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party. The focus of the PIA framework has been that the industry has been developing it on one side, and the Article29 endorsing it, on the other. Simultaneously, the European Commission’s DGINFSO has been providing the platform for its realisation. ENISA has facilitated this process, as below, for which it has received appropriate recognition by all stakeholders. The Executive Director Prof. Udo Helmbrecht underlines:”The RFID PIA Framework is certainly a big success for Europe, bringing major stakeholders to agree on a approach for proactively addressing legitimate privacy concerns posed by the inappropriate use of RFID applications.” Notably the Agency:•    Published a report 'Flying 2.0', on emerging security risks when using RFID and Internet of Things, in air travel •    Made a presentation to the Article 29 Technology Sub-group meeting in June on the Agency’s initial comments on the Industry's draft of 30, March 2010. •Issued an official Position in July 2010. The position was referenced in the Article 29 WP opinion of July 2010. • Assisted the European Commission in moderating a discussion between industry parties in a meeting held on the 22nd of October. This meeting paved way for an updated version of the PIA framework. • After receiving a request from the industry, ENISA provided informal input to the latest version (III) of the PIA framework, before it was submitted to the Article 29 in November.   Background: what is RFID? RFID, Radio Frequency IDentification, is the technology which enables our digital devices, e.g. smart phones, to become 'smart' and to communicate and interact with each other as well as the environment. In airports, for example, RFID item identification tags in the check-in systems, or on your luggage can improve effiecency and also make sure your luggage does not get lost. At the same time, it also brings new security concerns along. The Agency underlines in its reports that this technology, brings many benefits, but it also poses many new challenges and risks to be considered.

ENISA_PR_1136	2011-03-28	PR	EU Agency presents 1st report ever on how to measure IT resilience	 Business and governments are all reliant on secure networks, but how do you measure the resilience of these networks? The European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) has published the ’Main Challenges and Recommendations on Network and Service Resilience Metrics’ report, as well as a technical report. These are the first ever eports in Europe to address this area's lack of a holistic review. Metrics and a measurement framework are essential to the assessment of practices and policies to improve network and service resilience. The desktop research done by ENISA shows that a) there are very few existing frameworks and not one is globally acceptable; b) there are no standard practices as different organisations use different sets of baseline metrics and frameworks; and c) it is difficult to combine or aggregate diverse frameworks in a high-level assessment. Main challenges The main resilience metrics challenges include: • A lack of standard practices across the industry and public sectors; • Organisations using own-specific approaches and means to measure resilience, if at all;• Resilience metrics being difficult to deploy due to lack of knowledge and awareness;• A lack of analysis, long and active co-operation towards  a common understanding and approach;• The usefulness and value of resilience metrics declining when complexity increases; and • A lack of tools and solutions; The key consensus recommendations are: • To create a common understanding  and good practice or standard of resilience metrics (Taxonomy, Description and set of baseline metrics, Impact factors);• To undertake further research on open issues in resilience metrics (Aggregation, Composition, Thresholds, Data Analysis);• To develop tools and software to automate the deployment of resilience measurements;• To collect and analyse data;• To promote good practices and Information sharing; and • To deploy a conservative approach to introducing metrics (i.e. start with a small set of metrics!) The technical report is a first step towards building a common understanding, good practices and standards for resilience metrics. It holistically reviews the existing frameworks, models, classification of metrics, and baseline metrics.  “It is imperative for the Critical Information Infrastructure Protection to be able to accurately measure the security and resilience in Europe,” says Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA.   A NEW video clip on resilience metrics is available here.

ENISA_NEWS_1139	2011-03-14	NEWS	eID & eGovernement: Mapping security services to authentication levels	  STORK Quality Authentication Assurance levels This report reviews the Quality Authentication Assurance levels, the legal and technical barriers for interoperability in Europe,  and their mapping to public electronic services in the eGovernment programme framework, which require authentication of the user (security services). For instance, citizens are allowed to complete and send their tax declaration by electronic means. Or, they use a smart card to identify themselves prior to being able to benefit from online health care services. The report gives a general overview of European efforts. In particular it focuses on the activities of STORK (Secure idenTity acrOss boRders linKed) in relation to the levels and the mapping.   History Since the beginning of the 21st century, EU Member States have been planning, developing and implementing new solutions to offer electronic services to citizens and businesses on a digital platform. The common denominators for these eGovernment services are improving administrative efficiency, accessibility and user-friendliness and, above all, reducing costs. But it was not efficient or feasible to restart from scratch. Therefore, policy makers and experts agreed on the desirability of finding solutions that would allow all stakeholders to work together across (digital) borders, while respecting the autonomy of the Member States. Several projects were then started in order to generate the required solutions. One of the directions taken by IDABC (Interoperable Delivery of European eGovernment Services to public Administrations, Businesses and Citizens) defined a model. This model included levels of authentication. Later those levels were mapped to the existing authentication solutions in the EU Member States and some discrepancies were identified. Also, the discussion on security issues in cross-border electronic authentication recognised that some of them needed to be addressed. In the meantime, a number of countries cooperated to offer cross-border electronic services, which have been successfully activated and several pilots are still running.   Report outline Essential concepts in IT security are explained in this report. Moreover, the mappings of public electronic services in the eGovernment programme framework, which require an authentication of the user (security services) are illustrated by everyday life examples, such as cross border public transport, e-invoice across borders, and marriage between people of two nationalities. It also details the issues that may be or have been encountered by applying the model to electronic services. The definition and separation of the levels, as well as the assessment and validity of the levels have to be discussed in a broader sense in order to facilitate their application.   Recommendations  The report includes recommendations for a further fine-tuning of the model. They can in brief be summed up as follows: - Authentication levels should be defined as clearly as possible. - To make pan-European authentication levels acceptable and useable for service providers, a guideline for evalution of security demands should be developed -Pan-European interoperable authentication solutions will only be accepted by service providers and citizens if they are perceived as transparent and trustworthy.

ENISA_PR_1140	2011-03-08	PR	Facing the cyber-zombies – EU Agency gets tough on Botnets	" Botnets are networks of computers used without their owner’s knowledge for cybercrime such as spamming and the automated theft of valuable data such as credit card information and even politically motivated cyberattacks. “Botnets: 10 Tough Questions” is a policy-level distillation of ENISA’s consultation with top experts from all sides of the fight against botnets, including Internet Service Providers (ISPs), security researchers, law enforcement, Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and anti-virus vendors. It discusses questions such as:•    How much can we trust published figures about botnets?•    What is the role of governments in the fight against botnets?•    What is needed from legislation?•    Where should we invest money most efficiently? “The botnet numbers define the political agenda and they determine 100’s of millions of Euros of security investments – we should understand what is behind them.” says Dr. Giles Hogben, the report Editor. Yet, the report concludes that many botnet figures are likely to be inaccurate and even small numbers of bots can cause severe damage. “Size is not everything – the number of infected machines alone is an inappropriate measure of the threat” says Dr. Hogben. “Botnets: Measurement, Detection, Disinfection and Defence” is a comprehensive report on how to assess botnet threats and how to neutralise them.  It includes:•    A survey and analysis of methods for measuring botnet size and how best to assess the threat posed by botnets to different stakeholders.•    A survey and analysis of botnet countermeasures.•    A comprehensive set of 25 different types of best-practices to attack botnets from all angles: neutralising existing botnets, preventing new infections and minimising the profitability of cybercrime using botnets. The recommendations cover legal, policy and technical aspects of the fight against botnets and give targeted recommendations for different groups involved including:•    The clarification of defensive measures permitted in each member state•    Measures for encouraging users to keep their computers free of botnets.•    Supporting schemes for notification to infected customers by ISP’s The report also emphasises the need for a close international cooperation between governments, technically-oriented, and legislative institutions. ""Global cooperation is indispensable for successful defence against botnets"" says Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, the Executive Director of ENISA.   Both reports will be launched at a conference in Cologne on Wednesday 9th March. A third report focusing on legal issues in the fight against botnets will follow in Q2.

ENISA_NEWS_1144	2011-02-23	NEWS	EU Public-Private Partnership on Resilience Workshop 16-17 March	 Public Private Partnership Resilience Workshop An EP3R Workshop is now scheduled on the 16th of March and 17th of March morning, in Brussels. EP3R will provide a flexible European-wide governance framework to involve relevant public and private stakeholders in public policy. Together, all actors will conduct strategic decision making discussions to strengthen security and resilience in the context of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP). EP3R focuses on prevention and preparedness matters with a European dimension and in view of a global outreach. EP3R objectives, principles and proposed structure are described in the non-paper on the establishment of EP3R devised in June 2010 (available here). (http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/nis/docs/ep3r_workshops/3rd_june2010/2010_06_23_ep3r_nonpaper_v_2_0_final.pdf) ApproachA bottom-up approach is proposed. This means seeking the active contribution of relevant public and private stakeholders to ensure that EP3R will address their actual needs and priorities. Structure   In this context, three Working Groups have been established to discuss key issues and propose recommendations, respectively in the field of: 1. Key assets, resources and functions for the continuous and secure provisioning of electronic communications across countries;2. Baseline requirements for the security and resilience of electronic communications;3. Coordination and cooperation needs and mechanisms to prepare for and respond to large-scale disruptions affecting electronic communications.

ENISA_PR_1145	2011-02-18	PR	‘Bittersweet cookies’: new types of ‘cookies’ raise online security & privacy concerns	     The new Agency Position Paper identifies and analyzes cookies in terms of security vulnerabilities and the relevant privacy concerns. Cookies were originally used to facilitate browser-server interaction. Lately, driven by the advertising industry, they are used for other purposes; e.g. advertising management, profiling, tracking, etc. The possibilities to misuse cookies both exist and are being exploited.  The new type of cookies support user-identification in a persistent manner and do not have enough transparency of how they are being used. Therefore, their security and privacy implications are not easily quantifiable. To mitigate the privacy implications, the Agency recommends, among other things, that: • Informed consent should guide the design of systems using cookies; the use of cookies and the data stored in cookies should be transparent for users.• Users should be able to easily manage cookies: in particular new cookie types. As such, all cookies should have user-friendly removal mechanisms which are easy to understand and use by any user.• Storage of cookies outside browser control should be limited or prohibited.• Users should be provided with another service channel if they do not accept cookies.   The Executive Director of ENISA, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht underlines; ”Much work is needed to make these next-generation cookies as transparent and user-controlled as regular HTTP cookies, to safeguard the privacy and security aspects of consumers and business alike”. Dr. José Fernandes, Director of Department for Development Support and Academia, Microsoft Portugal, stated “Every year more businesses come online using the Internet. [...] Security and privacy are key to make this happen, so end-users and business people can fully trust online services. ENISA has a great role to play in this space and I congratulate them for putting forward this study.” The EU Member States (MS) must transpose Directive 2009/136/EC into national law by 25 May 2011. It underlines the need for valid consent by the user and users receive prior and clear information. Thus, the Agency advocates for a study of the MS' implementation measures after the transposition deadline.

ENISA_NEWS_1146	2011-01-27	NEWS	Baseline Capabilities of National/Governmental CERTs	 Since 2009 ENISA has worked on defining a minimum set of capabilities that a Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) in charge of protecting critical information infrastructures in the European Union Member States (EU MS) should possess in order to take part in and contribute to sustainable cross-border information sharing and cooperation. In addition to the recommendations on baseline capabilities created in 2009 (Part 1 – Operational Aspects), this year ENISA made further improvements and presents a set of policy recommendations on baseline capabilities of national/governmental CERTs. This document aims at supporting policy- and decision-makers in the EU MS in the establishment of a suitable framework that will enable their national / governmental CERTs to operate properly.

ENISA_PR_1147	2011-01-25	PR	The decisive factors for designing 'end-to-end' resilient networks identified	 Resilience is needed when operators lose control of the course of things, i.e. when incidents render incident response procedures ineffective and destabilise the management. Thus, resilience management and design has to consider all aspects: the end-users, the context in which they use the system, the technology of the system, the structure of the organisation and the organisation's ability to be resilient, and ultimately the ability of the society in which the system operates.   The new comprehensive Agency report focussing at public networks and services identifies the decisive factors for end-to-end resilience. It thereby informs standardisation bodies and regulators how to enable and manage end-to-end resilience. The e2e resilience concept in this report is expanded from being bound only to the network layer, to be a more comprehensive and thereby different approach in this unique study. This extended scope of end-to-end resilience is achieved from the planned combination of prevention, protection, response and recovery arrangements, whether technical, organisational or social.   The Agency Executive Director Prof. Udo Helmbrecht comments: “This report provides principles of designing networks able to carry end-to-end traffic, which is of great use for the national regulators.” In detail, the report stipulates that e2e requires: • To cope with incidents from very minor up to extreme impacts• To cope with situations that can be handled through everyday incident response procedures up to crises too complex to be handled in a day-to-day procedural manner The report also provides a comprehensive characteristics of a resilient system: A resilient system is reliable• A resilient infrastructure features high availability that is an effect of all components• A resilient system should provide for business continuity and management of unforeseen or unexpected risks• A resilient system should offer a security level adequate to the information being transmitted• End-to-end resilience requires resilience in all components of the infrastructure The report also identifies good practices to achieve resilience, which should be used by standardisation bodies and policy makers. Political context: The importance of resilience is e.g. underlined in the Digital Agenda, point 2.2 – which stresses the importance of effective interoperability between IT products and services to build a truly digital society and standards. It is also supported in e.g. the Granada Declaration).

ENISA_PR_1148	2011-01-20	PR	New Guide on Cyber Security Incident Management to support the fight against cyber attacks	   Recent reports of increased cyber attacks in 2010 has made the need for and use of the Agency report on how to fight Cyber attacks even more  topical and current. The Good practice guide for incident management focuses on the incident handling process. Incident handling is the core service carried out by most CERTs. This involves the detection and registration of incidents, followed by so called ‘triage’ (classifying, prioritising and assigning incidents), incident resolution, closing and post-analysis. Other topics covered by the guide include; • basics of a CERT, • its mission, constituency and authority, • organisational framework, • roles within a CERT, • workflows, • internal policies, • cooperation with external parties, • outsourcing, and • how to present the work to the management.   Political context. ENISA has advocated that all Member States set up a CERT and the European Commission recently (22/11/2010) proposed the EU’s Internal Security Strategy which included e.g. there should be an establishment of a Computer Emergency Response Teams in every Member States to network across Europe by 2012, and one for the EU-institutions.   The Agency Executive Director Prof. Udo Helmbrecht comments: “This guide is a useful tool to support the Commission’s proposal on 30/09/10 to boost Europe's defences against cyberattacks.”   The Good practice guide for incident management is a follow-up to the ENISA CERT setting-up guide. This new guide facilitates ENISA’s effort to reinforce the capabilities of national / governmental CERTs, the ‘digital firebrigades’, which are one of the key players in the Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP) at Member State levels. The target audience for the guide are the technical staff and management of governmental and other institutions operating a Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) in order to protect IT infrastructure. Yet, any group or team that handles information or network security incidents can benefit from following this guide.

ENISA_PR_1149	2011-01-17	PR	Governmental Cloud in the EU - New Agency Report	   “The new report presents a decision-making model for senior management to determine the best cloud solution from a security and resilience point of view”, says Mr. Daniele Catteddu, author of the report. The report details and explains the different steps of the decision-making model, and applies the model to four sample services (electronic healthcare services, electronic administrative procedures, email, and human resources applications). Analysis and conclusions are mainly based on three scenarios, which describe the migration to cloud computing of a Healthcare Authority, a local public administration and the creation of governmental cloud infrastructure. The Agency concludes that private and community clouds appear to be the solutions that best fit the needs of public administrations if they need to achieve the highest level of data governance. If a private or community cloud infrastructure does not reach the necessary critical mass, most of the resilience and security benefits of the cloud model will not be realised. The Executive Director Prof. Udo Helmbrecht comments: “Public cloud offers a very high level of service availability, and is the most cost effective. Yet, currently its adoption should be limited to non-sensitive or non critical applications, in the context of a well-defined cloud adaptation strategy with a clear exit strategy.” The report makes several recommendations to governments and public bodies, including:• National governments and the EU institutions should investigate the concept of an EU Governmental cloud.• Cloud computing will soon serve a significant portion of EU citizens, SMEs and public administrations. National governments should thus prepare a cloud computing strategy and study the role that cloud computing will play for critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP).• A national cloud computing strategy should address the effects of national/supra-national interoperability and interdependencies, cascading failures, and include cloud providers into the reporting schemes of articles 4 and 13 of the new Telecom Framework Directive.   Read the full report and all recommendations: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/rm/emerging-and-future-risk/deliverables/security-and-resilience-in-governmental-clouds/For interviews: Ulf Bergstrom, Spokesman, ENISA, press@enisa.europa.eu, Mobile: + 30 6948 460143, or for further information on the report: Daniele Catteddu, Expert, daniele.cattedduQ enisa.europa.eu EPR02/2011       Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_1151	2011-01-14	PR	New report: Data Breach Notifications in Europe	   Recent high profile incidents of personal data loss in Europe have prompted wide discussion about the level of security applied to personal information shared, processed, stored and transmitted electronically. The Executive Director of the Agency, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht commented: “Gaining and maintaining the trust of citizens of that their data is secure and protected is an important factor in the future development and take-up of innovative technologies and online services across Europe.” The introduction of an EU DBN requirement for the electronic communication sector in ePrivacy Directive (2002/58/EC) is important to increase data security in Europe and to reassure citizens that their data is protected by e-communications operators. The Agency has taken stock of the current situation in a new report, by interviewing the national DPAs and a representative sample of companies. The telecommunications sector recognises that DBN have an important role for data protection and privacy. Yet, operators are seeking clarifications at both EU and local level as to comply with DBN requirements. The expectations of DPAs and operators in most cases overlap, but there are some discrepancies. Key concerns raised by telecom operators and DPAs include: • Risk Prioritisation – The seriousness of a breach should determine the level of response. Breaches should be categorised according to risk levels to avoid ‘notification fatigue’.• Communication Channels – Operators need assurances that notification requirements will not impact their brands in a negative way.• Resources -  some regulatory authorities are already occupied with other priorities• Enforcement - DPAs indicated that sanctioning authority enables them to better enforce regulations.• Undue Delay in reporting-Regulators wants short deadlines for reporting breaches. Service providers, however want to focus their resources on solving the problem.• Content of Notifications - Operators want to make sure the notification content does not impact negatively on customer relations. Regulators want all the necessary information. In 2011, the Agency will develop guidelines for the technical implementation measures and the procedures, as in Art. 4 of Directive 2002/58/EC and analyse the possibility for extending the general obligation of DBN to other sectors, e.g. the financial sector, health care, and small businesses. This will be discussed at a workshop that ENISA organises in Brussels on 24 January, 2011.

ENISA_PR_1153	2010-12-17	PR	The Anatomy of Online Shopping dissected: new EU Agency white paper	   Nearly 40% of EU citizens shopped on-line in 2009, according to EUROSTAT’s Internet in 2009 survey. The paper concludes that online shopping will continue to be an increasing global trend. Yet, the biggest barrier is the fear of potential fraud or identity theft. This fear still keeps millions of consumers from buying goods or services online. This survey shows that ca 1/3 of those not having used the Internet for e-commerce had concerns about payment security. Another 30 % had privacy and trust concerns. As ‘Trust and security’ is one of the six major themes of the Digital Agenda for Europe, this fear underlines the last barrier for a bigger online economy. The paper gives a comprehensive overview of the definition, history, the main drivers and trends in online shopping. It also looks into e.g. banks payment services, the underlying Internet Infrastructure Services and online/fee fraud. The 5 ‘golden rules’ for consumers cover the following points: 1. Tips on avoiding fraudulent sites2. How to protect your data when shopping online3. Tips for safe transactions when paying online4. Overview of legislation that protects online customers5. How to deal with completion of the sale issues The paper concludes that online shopping offers great benefits for the consumers to enjoy. Sellers also reach customers that they would otherwise never reach. Online shopping can also provide organisational benefits such as improved processes, better brand recognition, reduced costs and improved productivity. However, the Internet also brings new risks, as criminals will make use of the new possibilities to steal, defraud and commit online crimes.The Executive Director, Prof. Udo Helmbrecht comments; “This comprehensive white paper on online shopping and its 5 ‘golden rules’ is a milestone for increasing trust in the digital economy, and making it prosper even more.” Click for the full report and all countermeasures.

ENISA_NEWS_1154	2010-12-15	NEWS	ENISA statement on Wikileaks events	" ""We have seen three major incidents, each of which has important implications for information security"" said Prof. Udo Helmbrecht, ENISA's Executive Director: • The first incident was the leakage of sensitive documents from the systems of the US Department of State - allegedly by an insider. This highlights the difficulty of defending against insider threats as well as the irreversibility of information leakage. • The second incident was the interruption of domain name and cloud services for the Wikileaks website. Although ostensibly due to terms of service violations, this highlights the vulnerability of globally distributed IT services to regional differences in policy, regulation, the interpretation of rights and the neutrality of service providers in the face of political pressure (see also risks R21 and R22 in ENISA's cloud computing risk assessment).   • The third incident was the hacktivist attacks both against, and in support of Wikileaks. A hacker called Jester mounted a denial of service (DoS) attack against the Wikileaks website. Later, in support of Wikileaks, the group Anonymous distributed the ""Low Orbit Ion Cannon"" (LOIC) tool to mount distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against several high profile services including Visa, Paypal and governmental sites (1). These incidents highlight the following issues: Size doesn't matter: the number of computers used in the attacks was relatively small (in the 100’s). Some press reports claim over six times the real number, which is indicative of the unreliability of information about botnets. ENISA is currently preparing a comprehensive report on ""Botnets: Detection, Measurement, Disinfection & Defence"" to be published in January 2011 which addresses this issue. The robustness of some services in the face of these attacks has demonstrated the resilience of cloud architectures against DoS attacks (as discussed in ENISA's cloud computing risk assessment). The LOIC tool (in Hivemind mode (2)) allows a third party to execute commands remotely. We note that apart from the potential legal implications, users thus cede control over their computer to a potentially untrusted third party. The denial of service attacks highlight the importance of the Commission's 2010 enhancements to the EU cybercrime directive, in enabling an efficient and effective reaction to cyber security incidents.  Prof. Helmbrecht notes: “The freedom the internet allows in moving between jurisdictions and technologies makes cyber security an asymmetric challenge. But our economy and our governments are heavily reliant on functioning and resilient systems. Therefore it is a challenge which must be met through global co-operation to strengthen all aspects of cyber security.”   1) Strictly speaking the computers running LOIC do not constitute a botnet since LOIC is installed with the consent of the user. However, LOIC does share features with botnet software, in particular the ability to respond to centrally issued commands. 2) The Hive Mind option is responsible for connecting to servers used for attack coordination.     Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of both ENISA news items & press releases!

The  newly launched ENISA report identifies the top security risks and opportunities of smartphone use and  gives practical security advice for businesses, consumers and governments. Top risks include  spyware, poor data cleansing when recycling phones, accidental data leakage, and unauthorised premium-rate phonecalls and SMSs.   This is in brief explained in the video clip on the same topic.       Stay updated - subscribe to RSS feeds of ENISA news items & press releases!

ENISA_PR_1158	2010-12-10	PR	Security, is there an app for that? EU’s cyber-security agency highlights risks & opportunities of smartphones	   Worldwide smartphone sales doubled last year (Gartner) and 80 million were sold worldwide in Q3 2010 alone: ENISA’s new report on smartphone security risks and opportunities is timely. If you are one of the hundreds of millions of smartphone users worldwide, you probably spend more time with your phone than your spouse: with its array of applications and sensors, it may even know more about you. These new life-partners are now an essential tool across all sections of society, from top government officials to businesses and consumers. They are famous for their diversity of functions; a smartphone can be a contactless wallet, a camera/videophone, a barcode reader, an email client, or a way of accessing social networks.  “Given the growing importance of smartphones for EU businesses, governments and citizens, we consider it essential to assess their security and privacy implications.” says Prof. Dr.Udo Helmbrecht, Executive Director of ENISA. In its new report, ENISA analyses the key security opportunities and risks. Some of the key risks are: • Accidental leakage of sensitive data –e.g. through GPS data attached to images.• Data theft by malicious apps and from stolen, lost or decommissioned phones.•  “Diallerware” – malicious software which steals money through unauthorised phonecalls.• Overload of network infrastructure by smartphone applications. In terms of opportunities, backup is often very well integrated into smartphone platforms, making it easy to recover data if the phone is lost or stolen. Another opportunity lies in the use of app-stores: “Most smartphone users only install 3rd party software through controlled software distribution channels.” says Dr. Marnix Dekker, co-author of the report. The most important result of the report is a comprehensive set of strategies for securing smartphones. “Smartphones are a goldmine of sensitive and personal information – it’s vital to understand how to maintain our control over this data. We’ve designed our recommendations to plug into a typical security policy” says Dr. Giles Hogben, co-author of the report. The report has recommendations for businesses, top officials and consumers – and for dealing with the security risks of mixing these roles. Read the full report. Link to the video clip: Link to FAQs.

ENISA_NEWS_1159	2010-12-08	NEWS	Council welcomed the Agency regulation proposals	 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/trans/118215.pdf Excerpts from the provisional version of the press release from the Council on Friday 3rd Dec 2010 at the 3052th Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council;  regarding the European Network and Information Security Agency. 'In a public session, the Council examined progress made on two draft regulations regarding the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA). The Presidency has prepared a progress report (16835/10) which takes stock of the progress made so far on two Commission proposals tabled in September and October 2010. The first proposal (14322/10) amends the existing ENISA regulation 460/2004 by extending its current mandate, due to expire in March 2012, by a further 18 months. This extension would help to avoid a legal vacuum if the new mandate is not adopted before the expiry of the current one. The second Commission proposal (14358/10) aims to strengthen and modernise ENISA and to establish a new mandate for a period of five years. The Commission proposes in particular to extend ENISA's tasks, to enable it to act as an interface between cyber-security experts and public authorities involved in the fight against cybercrime, to streamline ENISA's management structures and to gradually increase its financial and human resources.' Welcomed proposals 'Both proposals were examined by the Council bodies and all delegations welcomed them. The progress report identified the following main issues to be discussed further in order to prepare a Council's common position for the negotiations with the European Parliament: ENISA's tasks, the duration of the mandate, the role and structure of ENISA bodies and funding.'   Video See the video streaming from the Council discussions: (select your language of preference) http://video.consilium.europa.eu/index.php?pl=2&sessionno=3216&lang=EN Background: Council Progress Report of 25 Nov.

ENISA_PR_1168	2010-11-10	PR	Interim findings of CYBER EUROPE 2010; a successful ’cyber stress test’ for Europe	         The interim findings and recommendations of EU Member States participants of the 1st Pan-European Cyber Security Exercise indicate that ’CYBER EUROPE 2010’ was a useful ’cyber stress test’ for Europe’s public bodies. Member States are very keen to continue their efforts in the area of national and pan-European exercises. They also agreed on the importance of involving the private sector in further exercises and exchanging lessons learnt with other national or international exercises.     Supporting EU-wide cyber-security preparedness exercises is one of the priorities of EU policies, in particular of the Digital Agenda for Europe.  The Executive Director of ENISA, Dr Udo Helmbrecht commented on the interim conclusions: ”The CYBER EUROPE 2010 exercise was the first successful ’cyber stress test’ for Europe. It fully met its objectives to test Europe’s readiness to face online threats to essential critical infrastructure used by citizens, governments and businesses. We will work closely with Member States to identify and implement the lessons learnt from this exercise. We also encourage Member States to continue their efforts in the area of exercises, both at national and pan European levels. ENISA will strongly support their efforts.” Some of the interim findings and recommendations of Member States (MS) participants include: - The exercise fully met its objectives. The scenario was well balanced between technical and communication requirements. - Exchanging ’lessons-learnt’ with other (national or international) exercises would be useful. - The private sector should be part of the next pan-European exercise. - There is a lack of pan-European preparedness measures to test. This reflects the fact that many Member States are still refining their national approaches. - The exercise was only the first step towards building trust at pan-European level. More co-operation and information exchange is needed. - Incident handling in Member States varies a lot due to the different roles, responsibilities and bodies involved in the process. The Member States had difficulties in fully grasping how incidents are managed in other MS. - There is no need for creating a new pan-European directory of contacts. The existing ones are sufficient but need to be updated and completed regularly. - ENISA's role in organising and managing future exercises is highly recommended by MS.  - Member States support future pan-European exercises, but more time should be allocated to plan and execute the exercise.   These interim findings and recommendations are only reflecting the initial discussion with MS during the debriefing, and will be followed by a thorough analysis of the status reports, the logs, etc.   Participants There were 30 European countries involved, 22 actively enacting the scenario and 8 observers. In all, experts from over 70 public sector around bodies responded to +> 320 security ’injects’. Ca 50 cyber experts reacted in the Exercise Control Centre, situated in Athens, and had contact with further 80 experts around Europe.   Organisers 'Cyber Europe 2010' is organised by the EU Member States and supported jointly by the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) and the EU’s Joint Research Centre (JRC). The exercise planning of seven Member States, JRC and ENISA lasted over a year. This involved six workshops, weekly teleconferences, a ‘dry run’ and numerous trainings at national level.    Next Steps The exercise will be evaluated in depth. There will also be evaluations made at national level. These will later be fed into an aggregated public, EU-wide report of the exercise.

Both internally within a Member State, and in between Member States, across Europe, as to strengthen our common cooperation’. Objectives: The objectives of the exercise were:- To establish trust in between actors within the Member State, and between the Member States (MS)- To increase understanding of how management of incidents is done in different MS across Europe.- To test the communication channels, communication points and procedures in the MS/between MS.- To highlight interdependencies between MS across Europe.- To increase mutual support procedures during incidents or massive cyber attacks   Participants Participating were 22 Member States as players and 8 Member States as observers. In all, ca 50 persons were present in the Exercise Control Centre, situated in Athens, being exposed to more than 320 security so called ‘injects’ related to the availability of internet and corresponding critical online services. Across Europe in the participating Member States, 80 more persons were acting upon the instructions of the national moderators in Athens. The nationally based players may have contacted further others in their Member States. Typical profiles of players were Computer Emergency Response Teams, Ministries, National Regulatory Authorities, etc. Organisers 'Cyber Europe 2010' is organised by the EU Member States and jointly supported by the European Network Security Agency (ENISA) and the EU’s Joint Research Centre (JRC). Next steps - On 10th November, the Agency will make a media briefing in Berlin, at the Commission Representation, providing more information and draft conclusions about the outcome of the exercise. - The exercise will be evaluated in depth. There will also be evaluations made at national levels. These will later be fed into an accumulated public, EU-wide report of the exercise. The full report is anticipated to be published in the beginning of next year, i.e. early 2011.

ENISA_PR_1174	2010-10-07	PR	EU Agency analysis of ‘Stuxnet’ malware: a paradigm shift in threats and Critical Information Infrastructure Protection	"  (French soon to come) ENISA has produced a high-level impact analysis of the Stuxnet malware. The purpose is to provide EU decision makers with guidance on how to interpret the malware, its potential impact, mitigation and what these new types of attacks in general mean for Europe. The Executive Director of ENISA, Dr Udo Helmbrecht, comments: “Stuxnet is really a paradigm shift, as Stuxnet is a new class and dimension of malware. Not only for its complexity and sophistication, e.g. by the combination of exploiting four different vulnerabilities in Windows, and by using two stolen certificates, and from there attacking complex Siemens SCADA systems. The attackers have invested a substantial amount of time and money to build such a complex attack tool. The fact that perpetrators activated such an attack tool, can be considered as the ""first strike"", i.e. one of the first organized, well prepared attack against major industrial resources. This has tremendous effect on how to protect national (CIIP) in the future. After Stuxnet, the currently prevailing philosophies on CIIP will have to be reconsidered. They should be developed to withstand these new types of sophisticated attack methods. Now, that Stuxnet and its implemented principles have become public, we may see more of these kinds of attacks. All security actors will thus have to be working more closely together and develop better and more coordinated strategies.” Dr Helmbrecht concludes. For a more detailed, online, technical analysis, and Agency recommendations, pls click. How ENISA supports the Member States to prepare for attacks on critical information infrastructure Large scale attacks on Critical Information Infrastructure needs a coordinated reaction, involving the key players from both public and private sector. No Member State, hardware/software vendor, CERT or law enforcement agency can successfully mitigate sophisticated attacks like Stuxnet on their own.  ENISA, as an EU body of expertise in Network and Information Security (NIS), is supporting the European Commission’s CIIP action plan. This involves working closely with the Member States, public and private sector stakeholders’ to secure Europe’s Critical Information Infrastructure.   ENISA’s Resilience and CIIP program helps the Member States and private sector to develop good practices in a number of areas relating to the protection of Critical Information Infrastructure. These include combating botnets, improving the security of interconnected networks and reporting major security incidents. In 2011, ENISA will support the development of good practices in securing SCADA systems and analyse dependencies of critical sectors to Information and Communication Technologies.   'CYBER EUROPE 2010' 1st Pan European cyber security Exercise In addition ENISA, in co-operation with all EU Member States and 3 EFTA countries, is coordinating the first CIIP pan cyber security European exercise, the 'CYBER EUROPE 2010'. This exercise will test Member States’ plans, policies and procedures for responding to potential CIIP crises or incidents, such as ‘Stuxnet’. Reinforcing 'digital firebrigades'; CERTs ENISA is also active in reinforcing national/governmental 'digital firebrigades' i.e. Computer Emergency Response Teams, or CERTs, by supporting the Member States with the setting-up, training and exercising of incident response capabilities. Together, we define a set of baseline capabilities all teams should exhibit. We also work on enhancing capabilities in e.g. cross-border cooperation, Early Warning, and cooperation with law enforcement. ENISA actively supports a coordinated reaction to large scale attacks, and will (if called upon) willingly take its role as coordinator and facilitator for appropriate counter measures. Further information: Several NIS agencies in the EU Member States published information about Stuxnet in their respective language. Please refer to the ENISA country reports for an overview of security activities in each Member State. On e.g. these websites you can find more information on the malware itself, detection and mitigation, published by (external actors), Siemens and Symantec. • Siemens tool & procedures for removal • Symantec ongoing analysis of Stuxnet• Stuxnet White Paper (PDF)• Ongoing Stuxnet Response Blog   For interviews: Ulf Bergstrom, Spokesman, ENISA, press@enisa.europa.eu, Mobile: + 30 6948 460 143 "	https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/eu-agency-analysis-of-2018stuxnet2019-malware-a-paradigm-shift-in-threats-and-critical-information-infrastructure-protection-1
ENISA_NEWS_1175	2010-10-04	NEWS	‘CYBER EUROPE 2010’ -the 1st pan-European CIIP exercise	 On Friday, 24th September, 'phase one', and a major milestone of the ‘CYBER EUROPE 2010’ -the first pan European exercise on CIIP ever -was successfully completed. This first  phase included the training and a 'dry- run'. The day was dedicated to Member State moderators who will be driving 'CYBER EUROPE 2010'. Representatives from 21 countries participated, while observers were not invited in this first phase. The day was split in two parts: a) Morning sessions: participants were trained on all aspects of the exercise (setup, policies, tools, scenarios). b) Afternoon sessions: two 'dry-run' sessions were organised. The moderators were split in two groups exercising in a simple scenario: being a moderator and a player in one of the two sessions and vice versa in the other. In this way, moderators were able to understand how it feels to be on 'both sides of the river'. The exercise management achieved to test both these aspects. Successful practice 'dry-run' The feedback from all participants was very positive as they stated during the conclusion that they learned a lot from the session. Some minor issues were revealed, which will be worked out in the upcoming  period before the next phase. Next step The second phase of ‘CYBER EUROPE 2010’, i.e., the actual exercise, is planned to take place in November 2010.      Stay tuned - subscribe to RSS feeds of ENISA news items & PRs!

ENISA_NEWS_1177	2010-09-28	NEWS	Agency workshop on Art 13a/Telecom Package	 ENISA co-organized a workshop on transposition and implementation of Art. 13a of the new Telecom Package in the Member States of the European Union. Art 13a concerns the security and integrity of networks and services. It introduces, among other measures, an obligation to report security incidents with a significant impact on services.  The workshop was co-organised in cooperation with the Swedish Post and Telecommunications Agency (PTS) on the 24th of September, in Stockholm. The European Commission, competent national authorities from 15 Member States and ENISA were represented at the event. The workshop is part of a series of activities that ENISA, together with the Member States and the European Commission, is performing in order to achieve the final goal of a coherent and harmonized implementation of Art. 13a in all Member States. The workshop follows the one that took place in Madrid in May; see earlier news item.   Objectives The specific objectives of the Stockholm meeting were: • to share information about the state of the transposition and implementation process in each Member State.•  to agree the definition of measures that will make a harmonized implementation of Art. 13a possible (namely minimum security measure guidelines for National Regulatory Authorities, (NRA)s, and reporting schema to ENISA),• to increase the level of trust between the all involved parties.   Final results The final results matched the expectations both in terms of number of Member States  represented, which was more than double than in Madrid, and in terms of achievement of the objectives. As a follow-up, a third workshop on the topic will soon be organized.   Background: Read the consolidated version of article 13a of the Telecom Package in full.     Stay tuned - subscribe to RSS feeds of ENISA news items & PRs!

ENISA_PR_1183	2010-09-10	PR	New Report: Incentives & challenges for cyber security information sharing	      The importance of information sharing for the Critical Information Infrastructure Protection –CIIP-is widely acknowledged by policy-makers, technical and practitioner communities alike. The Agency has researched peer-to-peer groups, e.g. Information Exchanges (IEs) and Information Sharing Analysis Centres (ISACs). The report identifies the most important barriers and incentives in day-to-day practice in IEs and ISACs for CIIP. This research differs from other reports by being focused on the practitioners’ experiences. The material stems from three sources, literature analysis, interviews, and a two-round ‘Delphi’ exercise with security professionals. The report is launched in conjunction with the NIS Summer School, taking place 13-17 September, in Crete. Many of the barriers and incentives identified in literature are of low importance to practitioners and security officials working in IEs. The ‘real’ list of incentives for practitioners is instead: economic incentives (i.e. cost savings), incentives of quality, value, and use of information shared. Main barriers to sharing information are poor quality information, poor management, and/or reputational risks.   20 recommendations The Agency has produced 20 recommendations to different target audiences, e.g.: - Member States should establish a national information sharing platform and co-operate with other Member States. - Private sector should be more transparent in sharing information, improve preparedness measures based on information exchanged - Research and Academia should quantify the benefits and costs of participating in platforms; undertaking case-study research into where attacks might have been prevented, or their impact lessened. - The EU Institutions and ENISA should establish a pan European information sharing platform for Member States and private stakeholders. The EU Commission’s European Public Private Partnership for Resilience (EP3R) is the main policy initiative in this area. The Executive Director of ENISA, Dr Udo Helmbrecht, comments:   “Information sharing is a corner stone to improve the protection of critical information infrastructure-CIIP, which is vital for Europe’s economy and communications within Europe”.

ENISA_NEWS_1188	2010-07-14	NEWS	Agency Position on the Industry Proposal re: a Privacy Impact Assessment for RFID	 A framework for privacy and data protection impact assessments (PIA)  In the European Commission recommendation “on the implementation of privacy and data protection principles in applications supported by radio‐frequency identification” (12 May 2009), it is considered that member stated should ensure that Industry develops a framework for privacy and data protection impact assessments (PIA). On 31st of March, the industry published a draft proposal on  Privacy and Data Protection Impact Assessment Framework, sending it also to the Article 29 Working Party for endorsement. Role of the Agency According to Recital 17 of the RFID Recommendation, the development of the PIA Framework should build on existing practices also in the work conducted by ENISA. Given also ENISA’s expertise and experience in the field of risk management and developing a risk assessment framework on identifying emerging and future risks, the Agency has been asked by the European Commission to provide comments and recommendations on the draft of the PIA framework.  “Privacy by design”  ENISA considers this as a very important initiative, especially since such a framework would enhance and further promote solutions of “privacy‐by‐design”. The importance of “privacy-by-design” has already been highlighted in many ENISA reports and studies. In view of the above and considering the great effort already invested in the draft, ENISA reviewed and submitted its position to the Article 29 Working Party. Agency Position In its position, ENISA identified certain issues and areas for improvement. Based on these, the Agency makes some recommendations, which could substantially improve the current PIA draft. It is noted that given our experience and expertise, our comments are mainly related to the methodological part used (particularly regarding risk management and impact assessment) and not on legal issues.   For full Agency position.   Stay tuned - subscribe to RSS feeds of ENISA news items  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/news-wires/RSS and for PRs: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/press-releases/RSS 	https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/agency-opinion-on-the-industry-proposal-for-privacy-impact-assessment-for-rfid

ENISA_NEWS_1190	2010-07-09	NEWS	ENISA analyses the incentives and challenges to Public – Private Information Sharing	 Information sharing is recognised as an important activity in respect of sharing problems and solutions between organisations in a trusted environment. This research study aims to bring together, for the first time, knowledge from academic and practitioner circles about why information is, or is not, shared in these groups. This research will inform future policy and decision-making in this vital field. In that context ENISA and RAND Europe organised on 1st of July a workshop with major public and private stakeholders. The overall purpose of this workshop is to arrive at a robust, tested and prioritised list of the most important incentives and barriers to information sharing. Workshop participants had the chance to: gain access to unique research findings – this study is the first to collectively attempt to describe and assess the incentives and challenges to information sharing; obtain data to support your own internal business case for information sharing in your own organisation have an opportunity to network and strengthen your informal relationships with peers, practitioners and European experts from the public and private sector; have an opportunity to participate in the preparatory activities prior to the discussion and formulation of EU policy in this domain. Following the workshop, this prioritised list will be then used to identify and generate policy actions and concrete recommendations at the European level for integration into the final report of the study which will be made available to participants in summer 2010.

Its purpose is to assess the existing situation, specifically the coherence, effectiveness, accountability and transparency of Agencies' functioning.   This includes addressing issues such as governance, management, financial and human resources and supervision. The intra institutional group should find a common ground on how to improve agencies' work  in 2011. In their discussions since then, the institutions have identified 33 aspects which needed to be addressed. After having mapped out the factual state-of play with regard to each of these aspects, the working group will now focus on the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the system. Their work should now aim to identify possible solutions to problems, and ways to put them into practice.   ENISA as an EU Agency is actively monitoring the developments in this matter.

ENISA_NEWS_1200	2010-05-20	NEWS	Reinforced role for ENISA in the Digital Agenda	 Yesterday, (19/05) the European Commission’s Commissioner Neelie Kroes outlined a reinforced role for ENISA in a forthcoming proposal for a renewed Agency regulation. This was done in the communication regarding the Digital Agenda for Europe:http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/digital-agenda/documents/digital-agenda-communication-en.pdf   The communication highlights related to ENISA, in brief: CERTs:Commissioner Kroes underlines the roles of Computer Emergency Response Teams:• ‘Set up a European rapid response system to cyber-attacks, including a network of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and propose in 2010 a reinforced role for the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA).”   Cyber crime:In the field of cyber crime, Commission Kroes underlines“Finally, cooperation of relevant actors needs to be organised at global level to be effectively able to fight and mitigate security threats. This can be channelled as part of discussions on Internet Governance. At a more operational level, internationally coordinated information security targeted actions should be pursued, and joint action should be taken to fight computer crime, with the support of a renewed European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA).”   Trust and Security: The paper also clarifies that in the field of ‘Trust and Security’ the Agency will have a reinforced role. There is a key action (nr 6): to ‘ Propose a Regulation to modernise the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), which should be done in 2010, and to make proposals to set up CERT for EU institutions’. CERTs are the ‘digital firebrigades’, operationally managing e.g. cyber attacks. (See recent news item on CERTs).   Background: The Digital Agenda is the 'backdrop' for the EU and the Agency’s activities. It underlines that Europe needs a new action plan for making the best use of information and communication technologies (ICT). This should speed up economic recovery and lay the foundations of a sustainable digital future. The new action plan proposes to remove current obstacles to maximising the potential of ICTs, with long-term investments to minimise future problems. The Digital Agenda for Europe is one of the seven flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 Strategy. This strategy underlines the key, enabling role that the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) will have to play, if Europe wants to succeed in its ambitions for 2020.

ENISA_NEWS_1201	2010-05-20	NEWS	The 5th CERT workshop 	" One of the actions to support these activities includes bringing the CERTs together, to establish cross-border trust, and facilitate cooperation. For this purpose, ENISA’s traditional 5th workshop ""CERTs in Europe"" was hosted in Heraklion, Crete, Greece, on 19th May 2010. This year’s workshop was focused on the role of national/governmental CERTs in national and cross-border exercises. The workshops of previous years had been focused on cooperation among key players in NIS on a national, Member State level in order to guarantee the resilience of national public communication infrastructure. This workshop in 2010 however had the objective to share information on good methodological and organisational practice for CERTs involved in running of exercises for Critical Information Infrastructure Protection -CIIP -in their Member States. This includes looking at the EU policy perspective on CERTs, the US, Asia-Pacific and national case studies from EU Member States. The workshop brought together more than 50 participants from Member States and other countries, and was, as usual, received as being a premium tool for information sharing and networking. The results of the workshop will feed into ENISAs work on preparing the very first Pan-European exercise later in 2010.   For further details, see older news items:https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/1st-pan-european-ciip-excercises and http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/towards-the-1st-pan-european-ciip-exercise/     Stay tuned - subscribe to RSS feeds of ENISA news items http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/news-wires/RSS and for PRs: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/press-releases/RSS "	https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/the-5th-cert-workshop

ENISA_PR_1203	2010-05-12	PR	Key security actors, strategies, & good practices in Europe mapped	"    A key finding of the Reports, conducted for ENISA by Deloitte, is that there is no particular pattern in the observed European countries with respect to the existence of a national NIS strategy. Yet, many countries are found to be putting major efforts into making progress in this area. Information exchange mechanisms and cooperation amongst key stakeholders also vary from country to country. Successful cases of NIS - in areas such as security incident management and reporting, risk management and emerging risks, network resilience, privacy and trust, and awareness raising – are outlined as inspiration for others. As such, the Country Reports offer a unique overview of NIS ""state of the art"" in the 27 EU Union Member States and the 3 EEA countries [Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway]. Each Report outlines the country’s NIS strategy, regulatory framework and key policy measures, key stakeholders and their mandate, role and responsibilities. They provide an overview of the key NIS activities, key stakeholders interactions, information exchange mechanisms, co-operation platforms, and country-specific facts, trends, good practices and inspiring cases. The Country Reports are complemented by an updated Who-is-Who Directory on NIS, which serve as a “yellow pages” of NIS in Europe, containing contacts, websites and short descriptions of national and European authorities, CERTs, private sector and academic organisations active in NIS, as well as international and pan-European Organisations working in the area. The Executive Director of ENISA, Dr Udo Helmbrecht comments: ""The media often report information security incidents. But individuals, organisations and policy makers often don’t know how to prevent incidents, or where to turn to when things go wrong. ENISA has done a comprehensive job in mapping the security situation in Europe through these Country Reports and Who-is-Who Directory. This is of course key for all policy makers in the EU. We hope it will also help citizens and organisations in Europe understand what to do when they’re faced with problems.""

Moreover, the service and infrastructure components will need to actively cooperate to provide a reliable environment for increasingly complex, interdependent and mashed-up services. This report focuses on the subject of availability resilience, and thus the research into the technologies that improve the availability of online services, i.e. resilience of data networks, as it lays the foundation for EU2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda for Europe. The report identifies industry needs, new trends and their impact on decision-makers and research institutes to the most relevant research areas of network and information security within the next three to five years. The five research areas identified are: - cloud computing- real-time detection and diagnosis systems- future wireless networks - sensor networks- supply chain integrity The Executive Director of ENISA, Dr Udo Helmbrecht, states: ""This report gives the first direction of what the future IT security research priorities should be for the EU in our opinion.” This report is also related to the study on ‘Standardisation gaps related to resilience’ (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/act/res/technologies/std/), which together provides a comprehensive view on current needs for resilient technologies.

ENISA_NEWS_1209	2010-04-28	NEWS	Spanish EU Presidency - 'Granada Non-Paper' calls for stronger ENISA	 The EU Presidency Paper summarises key elements needed to implement the EU 2020 Strategy, including references to technologies and governance structures. It acknowledges the importance of both security and trust as pre-condition  for enhanced competitiveness and economic growth.  It also clarifies roles and responsibilities of actors at all governance levels (namely national, EU and global). Moreover, it calls for “a reinforced European Network and (Information) Security Agency” [at pg. 3]. This is done in the context of establishing a European framework for  eID and authentication. The objective would be to improve international co-ordination against cyber attacks. The paper elaborates on the Digital Single Market  with a focus on digital content and services, and related challenges.  Notably, the ENISA Work Programme also addresses this in 'PA 2'. (Preparatory Action), ‘Identifying Drivers and Frameworks for EU Sectoral NIS Cooperation’. This entails (i.a.) looking at barriers and incentives for cross-sectoral co-operation along the media value chain. Last but not least, the paper calls for the introduction of performance indicators  and annual scoreboarding of progress. This is the equivalent to  the “name-and-shame” instrument used quite successfully in the context of the Internal Market,  assessing on an annual basis the implementation of  respective measures at national level.

ENISA_PR_1213	2010-04-13	PR	Flying 2.0?  Study of Internet of Things/RFID in air travel launched	     Following up on European Commission  communication on IoT Action Plan for Europe, the EU’s ‘cyber security’ Agency ENISA - The European Network and Information Security Agency, has analysed the risks associated with a future air travel scenario, enabled with “Internet of things”, IoT / RFID technology. The report identifies major security risks, as well as privacy, social and legal implications and also makes concrete policy and research and legal, recommendations. IoT is a vision where all manufactured things are connected to each other via wireless or wired communication networks. The movement of travellers, airport staff, and luggage creates an increasing, continuous interaction between smart devices. It also implies sharing of significant amounts of sensitive information. Every day ca 28.000 flights occur in Europe, (i.e. ca 10 Mn/year), so the importance of air travel is easily understandable. The Executive Director of ENISA, Dr. Udo Helmbrecht comments on the report; “To fully realise the benefits of the Internet of Things, the challenges and risks that IoT implies must be identified and addressed in a proactive way. These risks do not always have to do with the technology per se but with the way we use it.” Three policy recommendations: 1. Rethink existing business structures and introduce new business models.  Air transportation actors (e.g. airlines, airports, logistics, aviation security agencies, etc) should proactively stay alert for new business models. 2. User-friendliness and inclusiveness of devices, processes and procedures - we need to be inclusive. 3. Develop and adopt policies for data management and protection Five research recommendations: 1. Data protection and privacy, 2. Usability, 3. Multi-modal person authentication, e.g. biometric procedures, 4. Proposing standards of light cryptography protocols, and, 5. Managing trust as a central consideration: an enterprise should understand its own trust framework. Three legal recommendations: 1. Support for users, e.g. for data subjects to better exercise their rights. 2. Placing a high value on information and data. 3. Harmonisation of data collection by airport shops and efforts to raise awareness, among travellers of the collection and processing of data. Three recommendations are given specifically to the European Commission: 1. Enforcement and application guidelines for the European regulatory framework.  2. Alignment of research with both industrial and societal needs, e.g. ethical limits research.  3. Need for security and privacy impact assessment and trials of new technologies before deployment. The risks identified include e.g.: failure of the air travel procedures, passenger frustration and low social acceptance, loss/violation of citizen/passenger privacy and social exclusion.

ENISA_NEWS_1216	2010-04-07	NEWS	Behavioural biometrics briefing launched	" Blinking patterns, brainwave measurements, your way of walking, keystroke dynamics, voice recognition, text style –are all examples of behavioural biometrics. Biometrics measure features of a person over time. Behavioural biometrics can enhance the security of user authentication and intrusion detection applications, often with very low impact on the system users. As well as traditional authentication scenarios such as system login, they may also be used to monitor a system for intrusion (e.g. if an unauthorised user is using a workstation). What you will see in the next “Mission Impossible""  or ""Minority Report” movie with Tom Cruise may well be new methods of behavioural biometrics. Some key findings of the recent ENISA briefing paper include:- They are most useful when you are using more than one type of biometric at the same time, and as a complement to more robust methods -Some behavioural biometrics, require specialised and sometimes highly obtrusive equipment which may be off-putting to users. - Other behavioural biometrics offer a completely unobtrusive technique to identify or classify individuals. -Such unobtrusiveness may be challenging from the point of view of collecting user consent, as required by law in many jurisdictions. - Data collected by behavioural biometrics may be used for secondary purposes. This can involve the processing of highly sensitive data.    ENISA Briefings are short descriptions of emerging issues in security aimed at policy and decision makers. The purpose of this briefing is to give an introduction to the possibilities offered by behavioural biometrics, as well as their limitations and the main issues of disagreement between experts in the field.

ENISA_NEWS_1222	2010-03-02	NEWS	How to deploy DNSSEC?	"  The ENISA ""Good Practices Guide for deploying DNSSEC” (Domain Name System Security Extensions) has been published.  DNSSEC is a security extension which provides the possibility to origin authentication of DNS data,  data integrity, and authenticated denial of existence. The guide lists the considerations that have to be made and provides recommendations for the security details and procedures to be defined. These procedures should be followed with specific timing requirements in order to deploy DNSSEC:• by domain holders, signing their domain zones;• in validating recursive resolvers. These considerations have to be addressed when specifications are compiled:• to deploy DNSSEC using internal resources;• for buying a DNSSEC enabled commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) DNS product;• to outsource all or part of the DNS service and sign a service level agreement (SLA). The guide addresses DNSSEC deployment from the point of view of information security managers responsible for defining a policy and procedures to secure the DNS services of a company or an organisation, and from the point of view of competent authorities defining requirements for deployment.   Stay tuned - subscribe to RSS feeds of ENISA news itemshttp://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/news-wires/RSS "	https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/how-to-deploy-dnssec

ENISA_NEWS_1226	2010-02-25	NEWS	Security Issues in Cross-border e-Authentication 	   The Agency has launched a new report on Security Issues in Cross-border Electronic Authentication. Improving the interoperability of electronic identification and authentication systems is a European task and a task for all Member States. ENISA analysed the current situation and assessed the security risks of electronic authentication in cross-border solutions. To visualize these risks, two different projects offering cross-border authentication have been examined and evaluated, Netcards/EHIC and Stork. The public services of egovernment  and health care providers are increasingly offering citizens in EU Member States electronic access to these services. These e-services are usually tailored at a national level with specific technologies, security concepts and business logic. In addition, these e-services are governed by the data protection laws of the individual Member State.   Common goals The goals of these systems are identical for all Member States: managing identities, improving administrative efficiency, improving accessibility and user-friendliness, reducing abuse and fraud and, above all, reduction of costs. Yet, in most cases, these systems can only be accessed from within the Member State and by citizens of that state.   Making the digital internal market functioning European citizens who move freely through Member States face the problem that their eID documents from their home state do not allow access to electronic services of another Member State in which they are currently present. This may be an undue restriction on EU citizens’ use of these services. Administrations, at the other hand, cannot provide services to European citizens from other Member States with the same ease and efficiency as their own citizens. So there is a need to extend these digital services beyond national borders and beyond the user group of national citizens. At the same time, European and national data protection laws and regulations must be respected and may not be undermined by cross-border distribution of personal data.   Cross Border interoperability - A task for Europe Improving the interoperability of electronic identification and authentication systems is thus a European task and a task for all Member States. This report visualizes the security risks of electronic authentication in cross-border solutions, in two different projects. -          The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) facilitates access to health care services for insured European citizens during temporary stays abroad. NETC@RDS for eEHIC ID is a pan-European project supported by the EU eTEN programme. It facilitates medical treatment of European citizens by using an electronically readable European health insurance card. -          STORK (Secure idenTity acrOss boRders linKed) is a large-scale pilot project in the ICT Policy Support programme to simplify administrative formalities by providing secure online access to public services across EU borders.   Critical success factors: ·        establishing the legal and contractual framework ·        identifying the citizen through credentials ·        authenticating system participants across borders ·        making online connections secure ·        bridging technological differences ·        establishing and agreeing on a common security policy. By covering these factors in electronic cross-border authentication, the national goals of eID solutions can be extended successfully to a pan-European solution.

ENISA_NEWS_1227	2010-02-24	NEWS	"""Member States need holistic cyber security strategies"" "	 The Executive Director advised Member States and the private sector to work closely together to implement  these cyber security strategies. This should be done through sharing of information, deployment of good practices (e.g. on incident reporting and handling) and national exercises. He also urged all Member States to establish and operate governmental CERTs  (Computer Emergency Response Teams) the 'digital fire brigades'. Bringing national CERTs together to  co-operate and share information is necessary to respond to national, pan European or even global incidents and threats. ENISA will continue underpinning Member States and private sector efforts to  enhance the resilience and security of their networks. This year ENISA will  plan and execute the first pan European exercise. Additionally, the Agency develops a number of good practices and works with Member States to deploy them.

ENISA_PR_1232	2010-02-08	PR	Instantly online-17 golden rules for mobile social networks	      Online Social Networking Sites (SNSs) have had an exceptional growth trend on Internet. 211Mn users (out of 283 Mn) in Europe use SNS, and, primarily, Facebook in 11/17 countries studied. The modern way of staying in touch with business or personal contacts is through SNS and other digital tools. Consequently, the ways people meet, share opinions, communicate information and ideas is changing. With growing popularity of SNS, the demand for instant, continuous access over the mobile phone has increased-i.e. mobile social networks (MSN). More than 65 Mn users now access the social network Facebook over their mobile device. MSN users are 50% more active than non-mobile users, and are estimated to be 134 Mn in Europe by 2012. Many MSN users also use their phone as a backup device for business mails, personal data, contacts, pictures, and access codes. As a consequence, a lost mobile phone can cause serious damage, e.g. when illegitimately used to access MSNs. Many mobile phones come pre-packaged at purchase, with built in MSN applications i.e. ‘on-deck’ services.Several stories from Italy, France, Spain, Greece, UK, witness that many SNS/MSN users are largely unaware of security risks, privacy issues and threats related to misuse of the information put online in an SNS and of proper online privacy protection. A number of unique MSN risks/threats are identified in the report. The ENISA report gives an overview of the situation and underlines that in particular MSN users need awareness on how to safer use social networks on a mobile phone to avoid unexpected and damaging consequences. Risks include identity theft, and serious damage to personal or corporate reputation, or data leakage. Two samples case studies: • Fake profile on Facebook. A professor at Turin University discovered someone else had created a profile for him at Facebook with offensive features, affecting his reputation.• Data leakage/corporate reputation. After a 2008 incident, Virgin Atlantic airlines later dismissed 13 staff members who had posted comments on Facebook which e.g. criticised the cleanliness of the company’s fleet and of its passengers. Similarly, British Airlines check-in staff at Gatwick posted messages on Facebook saying e.g. travellers were ‘smelly’ and criticised the chaotic operations at Heathrow.The paper also gives a comprehensive view of the SNS world under the lens of the European directive on data protection (Dir. 95/46/EC). The Executive Director of ENISA, Dr. Udo Helmbrecht, comments: “This report provides practical, hands-on advice to the users of how to more safely be online, anywhere and anytime, when enjoying mobile social networks.” The paper includes 17 practical ‘golden rules’. Samples include:- Remember to log out from the social network once your navigation is over. - Do not to allow the social network to remember your password (this function is called ‘Auto-complete’).- Do not mix your business contacts with your friend contacts.-Report immediately stolen/lost mobile phone with contacts, pictures, or personal data in its memory - Set the profile privacy level properly.

ENISA_PR_1236	2010-01-21	PR	Spam Survey 2009 - the fight against spam	        The survey targeted email service providers of different types and sizes, and received replies from 100 respondents from 30 different countries, throughout the EU (26 /27 EU Member States); and 80 million mailboxes managed. The survey analyses how e-mail service providers combat spam in their networks, and identifies the state of art in the fight against spam. Some of the key findings are:- Less than 5% of all email traffic is delivered to mailboxes. [This means the main bulk of mails, 95%, is spam.]This is a very minor change, from 6%, in earlier ENISA reports. - 70% of respondents consider spam extremely significant or significant for their security operations. - Over ¼ of respondents had spam accounting for >10% of helpdesk calls.- Among very small providers, 1/4 of respondents allocate anti-spam budgets of over EUR €10,000 per year.- 1/3 of very large providers dedicate anti-spam budgets >EUR 1 Mn/year.- Fighting spam has reached a certain level of maturity. - ISPs are using various kinds of measures: technical, awareness, policies and legal framework. Blacklists are the most commonly used anti-spam tool. On average 5 kinds of measures are used.- ISPs consider spam prevention as a competitive advantage to attract and retain customers. However, spam is not a critical factor. The Executive Director of ENISA, Dr Udo Helmbrecht concludes: “Spam remains an unnecessary, time consuming and costly burden for Europe. Given the number of spam messages observed, I can only conclude more dedicated efforts must be undertaken. Email providers should be better at monitoring spam and identifying the source. Policy-makers and regulatory authorities should clarify the conflicts between spam-filtering, privacy, and obligation to deliver.” Next steps: ENISA will deliver a report on botnets to study root causes of spam by the end of 2010. Botnets are networks of thousands of remotely controlled computers, secretly infected by malicious programs “bots”, for distributing spam and criminal activities. Download the full survey and slides.

ENISA_PR_1246	2009-11-26	PR	Position Paper: security risks, online banking and eID cards	"       The EU’s ‘cyber security’ Agency, ENISA (the European Network and Information Security Agency) today presents its new Position Paper. The paper is focusing on authentication risks with European eID Cards. It analyses 7 vulnerabilities, identifies 15 threats and gives security recommendations. Major European eID interoperability projects, such as STORK and its successor ELSA are aiming at a European-wide take-up of new technologies. In this context, ENISA takes an independent look at the security risks related to online banking authentication by comparing smart eID cards with other authentication means in its latest Position Paper. Online banking in one of the most widely-used electronic services by European consumers. It is a strategic service for financial institutions and users. With 24 hour service availability, it is extremely convenient. It is often without any extra costs; or even at reduced costs compared to traditional banking processes. However, online banking fraud is on the rise. Thus, security is a major concern both for online banking, e.g. tax declarations. The report also includes a case study on privacy issues when authenticating with smart cards to online social networks. The Agency report explains that because more and more internet applications require authentication, more standardized approaches to user identification and authentication are needed. In Europe, several states have already rolled out electronic ID cards. The first steps when we use internet services are usually to identify ourselves by our names and then authenticate that it is us. The security levels for these steps can vary from a simple combination of username, password, through a secret PIN, to credentials generated by some external device or a smart card using cryptography. Smart cards are increasingly being used for authentication purposes. Many European identity cards contain a smart-card chip, with functionalities for online authentication. The ENISA Position Paper defines a comprehensive list of requirements for national ID cards to ensure that they become as flexible and as multi-purpose as possible. The Executive Director of ENISA Dr Udo Helmbrecht concludes: ""Electronic identity cards offer secure, reliable electronic authentication to Internet services, but banks and governments must cooperate better to be able to use national eID cards for banking purposes.""

ENISA_PR_1248	2009-11-20	PR	ENISA clears the fog on cloud computing security	      How can businesses and governments get the obvious benefits of cloud computing without putting their organisation at risk? The EU’s ‘cyber security’ agency, ENISA (the European Network and Information Security Agency) answers this question in a comprehensive, new report on “Cloud Computing: Benefits, risks and recommendations for information security”. It covers the technical, policy and legal implications and most importantly, makes concrete recommendations for how to address the risks and maximise the benefits for users. ENISA’s new report is the first to take an independent, in-depth look at all the security and privacy issues of moving into the cloud, outlining some of the information security benefits of cloud computing, as well as 35 key security risks. ENISA and their expert group started with a survey asking businesses their main concerns in moving into the cloud. “The picture we got back from the survey was clear:” says Giles Hogben, an ENISA expert and editor of the report - “the business case for cloud computing is obvious – it’s computing on tap, available instantly, commitment-free and on-demand. But the number one issue holding many people back is security – how can I know if it’s safe to trust the cloud provider with my data and in some cases my entire business infrastructure?” The report answers this question with a detailed check-list of criteria which anyone can use to identify whether a cloud provider is as security-conscious as they could be. “This is the most important result of our report: our check-list isn’t just pulled from thin-air,” says Daniele Catteddu, the ENISA report co-editor – “we based it on a careful risk analysis of a number of cloud computing scenarios, focussing on the needs of business customers. The most important risks addressed by the check-list include lock-in, failures in mechanisms separating customers’ data and applications, and legal risks such as the failure to comply with data protection legislation.” With the security check-list, customers now know the right questions to ask and providers can answer those questions just once instead of being overloaded with requests for assurance about their security practices. Cloud computing also entails great economic interests, e.g. the IDC forecasts a growth of European cloud services from €971m in 2008 to €6,005m in 2013. But as the report points out, cloud computing is also a security enabler. The Executive Director of ENISA, Dr Udo Helmbrecht, underlines: “The scale and flexibility of cloud computing gives the providers a security edge. For example, providers can instantly call on extra defensive resources like filtering and re-routing. They can also roll out new security patches more efficiently and keep more comprehensive evidence for diagnostics.” Download the full report.

In his concluding remarks, he noted that the panel had identified three types of activity that could sensibly contribute to achieving such a balance: Helping citizens to develop simple risk management techniques for the  electronic world (electronic common sense).Appropriate use of technology.Regulation. He also stressed the fact that context is extremely important when designing security solutions and that rules driven or check-list approaches are no substitute for clear thinking. In the second panel on the subject of net neutrality, Dr. Purser explained why security should be seen as a necessary condition for neutrality and went on to explain what ENISA is doing to support the Member States and the Commission in the area of Internet resilience. He noted that a key success factor in securing the Internet of the future will be the extent to which different communities are able to work together to achieve common goals and cited the European Public Private Partnership for Resilience (EP3R) as a practical example of efforts to form such a partnerships. 	https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/fourth-internet-governance-forum-in-egypt

ENISA_PR_1259	2009-10-16	PR	New Executive Director at ENISA: Helmbrecht at the helm	        The EU’s ‘cyber security’ Agency ENISA [i.e. the European Network and Information Security Agency] has a new Executive Director as of 16th October; Dr Udo Helmbrecht. Dr Helmbrecht is the former President of the German IT Security Agency BSI, [the Federal Office for Information Security]. Dr Helmbrecht clarifies his visions for the Agency as its new Executive Director: “I am very pleased, privileged and humbled to have gained the Management Board’s trust to become the Executive Director of ENISA. I proudly and readily assume this position, working for Europe. Before I worked for the improvement of the IT security in Germany; now I want to contribute to a secure information Society in Europe. It will be a bit of “changing hats” for me. As such, this is a tremendously stimulating step in my career. Yet, I deem my experience as head of a national security authority should be of added value for Europe and ENISA. I will strive to help the Agency to work more closely, hand-in-hand, with the European Institutions, trustfully and actively together with the Member States and to promote cooperation between governments, businesses and NGOs to the benefit of citizens in the European Union. That way, we should increase the appreciation of ENISA as a brand for trust and security. I will work towards a permanent mandate for ENISA-beyond the present 2012 ‘sun-set’ clause. The clear and permanent mandate is necessary to manage the increasing, fundamental role of security for economic and financial matters; for business and consumers alike. Ultimately, the economy of Europe is at stake if we do not manage security matters properly and adequately. At the same time, we should promote the benefits of security to the citizens, so they gain trust in the advantages of information and communication technology to safely enjoy life in cyber space. I am firmly convinced that Europe needs more cooperation and dialogue with all security stakeholders. ENISA’s role in this is clear: Europe and its institutions need an independent body to give expert advice in security matters. The Agency must become a stronger and even more respected actor, working as a political advisory body and ‘pace-setter' for the European Commission and the European Parliament. As such, the Agency’s advice should have a lasting impact on the laws and regulation of the Commission and the Member States. There are many daunting security challenges ahead of us. But I am certain that with the support of the skilled ENISA staff and the Member States we will do it. We will make the digital, online Europe a safer place. Working together; ‘the whole is more than the sum of its parts'; which is the essence of Europe.” Dr Helmbrecht concludes. Dr Udo Helmbrecht was born in 1955, Castrop-Rauxel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. He has more than 30 years of professional, management experience in the IT sector. His experience has been gained in various sectors of society. This includes e.g. energy industry, insurance company engineering, aviation, defence, and space industry, before becoming President of BSI in 2003. Now, in 2009, new European security challenges await at ENISA. At the same time, Michael Hange in ENISA’s Management Board and former Deputy Head at BSI becomes the new President of BSI, replacing Dr Helmbrecht.

ENISA_PR_1261	2009-10-13	PR	ENISA- 1st EU Agency with IPv6	"         The EU Agency ENISA [i.e. the European Network and Information Security Agency] now delivers its web site content over the new Internet protocol IPv6. With this action, ENISA is the first EU Agency to implement the European Commission's IPv6 Action Plan. All computer and electronic devices that connect to the web and other online services uses Internet Protocol Addresses. The current Internet Protocol, IPv4, provides a limited number of such addresses. According to estimates these addresses will all be exhausted by 2011. The new Internet Protocol, IPv6, allows every citizen and organization to have as many Internet Addresses as they need to connect every conceivable device to the Internet: mobile phones, car navigation systems, home appliances, industrial equipment, etc. Besides the obvious increase in address space, IPv6 offers many technological advantages that have significant economic impact. IPv6 is expected to be a key driver for many new mobile and wireless applications and services and an essential technology for implementing ambient intelligence. During 2008 ENISA carried out an assessment of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), along with two other key technologies, regarding its potential to provide increased network resilience. This analysis was carried out from two perspectives. The first consisted of analysing the characteristics of the selected technologies and their public communication network's resilience enhancing features. In parallel, the effectiveness, problems and gaps that potentially could compromise the availability of networks and services, was assessed through interviews with twelve network operators in EU Member States. The Agency commented: “By delivering its web content over the new Internet Protocol, ENISA actively supports Europe’s objective to widely implement IPv6 by 2010. At the same time, ENISA is using its own recommendations; to take advantage of the technological and resiliency features of the new protocol.” Bosco Fernandes of Nokia Siemens Networks, former Coordinator of the EC Steering Committee Task Force on IPv6 and member of the ITU Executive Board, welcomed this initiative: ""ENISA has made a strategic move towards IPv6 deployment. The IPv6 community most welcomes this initiative ENISA has taken. The Industry at large is now finally appreciating the need to deploy IPv6 in most sectors. It is a high priority topic in the telecom industry as well as for 3GPP, ITU and the UMTS Forum."" To offer its web content over IPv6, ENISA deployed native IPv6 connectivity at its service providing network and enabled Domain Name System (DNS) resolution and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol/Secure (HTTP/S) service delivery over IPv6. Background: European Commission communication on IPv6, of 27 May 2008.ENISA’s Multiannual Thematic Program has the objective to improve the resilience of public eCommunications in Europe.

ENISA_PR_1263	2009-09-10	PR	Guide to mitigate vulnerabilities, threats & cyber attacks	       EU Agency ENISA presents the first pan European Good Practice Guide on Network Security Information Exchange (NSIE). The main aim of this guide is to assist Member States and private stakeholders in setting up and running NSIEs at national level. The guide could also pave the way for the creation of the first pan European NSIE for critical communication networks and services. ENISA’s stock taking and analysis on this topic confirmed the importance and strategic value of information sharing. Member States are strongly interested in better understanding and deploying information sharing exchanges. They explicitly requested ENISA to develop a good practice guide based on observed practices of existing NSIEs. The content of the guide represents the aggregation of good practices from a number of countries having significant expertise in the area and individual discussions with experts. NSIE is a form of strategic partnership among key public and private stakeholders. The drivers for this information exchange are the benefits of members working together on common problems and gaining access to information which is not available from any other source. NSIE is an excellent vehicle to: better understand a changing security and resilience environment learn in a holistic manner about intrusions, vulnerabilities and threats develop recommendations for mitigating vulnerabilities, threats, & cyber attacks jointly develop methods to continuously assess existing measures provide unique insights and strategic views to policy makers and strategists The Agency commented: “Information sharing is a crucial element in EU efforts to enhance the resilience and security of critical communication networks and services. Hopefully this guide will pave the way for an accelerated deployment of national NSIEs and consequently of pan European one” This good practice guide is part of ENISA’s Resilience Program. It contributes to European Commission (or EU) strategy of Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP). This strategy calls for wide deployment of national NSIEs and the creation of a pan European Public Private Partnership for Resilience.

ENISA_PR_1264	2009-09-07	PR	ENISA warns: increase in ATM crime	       Annual cash machine losses in Europe approach EUR 500 million: ENISA provides advice for consumers.  With the annual cost of ATM crime in Europe approaching half a billion Euros, ENISA, the European Network and Information Security Agency, is urging consumers to be more aware of the risks and take precautions to avoid personal loss. The rapid growth in the number of ATMs, combined with more sophisticated attacks and fraud has resulted in an alarming 149% rise in ATM attacks in 2008. These worrying findings, along with information and case studies highlighting the different ATM crimes and recommendations to help detect and prevent them, are published this week in a paper by ENISA entitled ‘ATM Crime: Overview of the European situation and golden rules on how to avoid it’. The number of ATMs in Europe increased 6% last year to almost 400,000, with many now found in remote site locations such as convenience stores, airports and petrol stations. Seventy-two percent of European ATMs are located in just five countries: UK, Spain, Germany, France and Italy. Cash taken illegally from ATMs is still the preferred method for criminals who obtain pin numbers using a wide range of techniques from ‘shoulder surfing’ to complex skimming techniques. This can involve the usage of a small spy camera, a false PIN overlay and even fake machines; while increasingly Blue Tooth wireless technology is used to transmit card and PIN details to a nearby laptop computer. During 2008 alone, a total of 10,302 skimming incidents were reported in Europe. Other methods used to extract money include trapping and then retrieving users’ cards, stopping withdrawals in the middle of a transaction only to complete them when the victim has left and even trapping cash in the machine. Organised criminal gangs are also using sophisticated phishing techniques and hacking into bank computer systems and web sites to obtain PIN and account information. ATM burglaries and physical attacks have also seen an increase by 32% over the last 12 months from ram raids and explosions to the use of rotary saws, thermal lances and diamond drills. “ATMs are attractive to criminals because they contain bank notes, while the bank cards themselves give thieves access to customers’ bank accounts,” the Agency stated. “Looking ahead, ATM crime is likely to become even more attractive as the latest generation of ATMs is designed to dispense other services and products such as phone top ups and stamps. The first line of defence against ATM crime is increasing awareness of the risks so that users can take simple precautions such as shielding their PIN when entering it and by keeping alert to any signs of tampering or suspicious activity at an ATM.” The paper published this week by ENISA recommends that further information and advice are provided nationally in EU Member States by banks, financial institutions, payment schemes and law enforcement agencies. As part of this process ENISA has drawn up its list of Golden Rules to offer maximum protection with minimum effort. ENISA Golden Rules Choosing an ATM Machine Don’t use ATMs with extra signage or warnings Try to use ATMs inside banks Don’t use freestanding ATMs Physical surroundings Use an ATM which is in clear view and well lit Be cautious of strangers and check they are at a reasonable distance away Making Operations Pay careful attention to the front of the machine for tampering Pay attention to the card reader for signs of additional devices Look carefully for differences or unusual characteristics of the ATM’s PIN pad Look out for extra cameras Protect your PIN by standing close to the ATM and shielding the key pad Report confiscated cards immediately Beware of ATMs that don’t dispense cash and non-bank ATMs that don’t charge fees Statement Reviews Frequently review your account statements Report any suspicious activity immediately The Agency stated: “Information security has, for too long, been focusing on technical solutions to maximise protection. Most ATM crime is focused on exploiting the human element and card holders must be more aware of the risks they are exposed to and how to prevent fraud occurring. We hope this latest report will be the start of an on-going process to increase awareness and reduce the growing cost of ATM crime.” Please find the full report here. 	https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-warns-increase-in-atm-crime

ENISA_PR_1267	2009-06-25	PR	AR London event	" Top speakers met in London last week to tackle a list of security issues and challenges which affect both private and public sectors and discuss ways to raise information security awareness among members of user groups concerned. Leaks of sensitive information have recently affected businesses, leading to significant data loss. Bringing user groups up to speed by employing appropriate instruments and methods is a matter of priority of private and public sector organisations alike.How do we control information that enters and leaves an organisation? By applying sharp in house policies and managing data controls while ensuring that staff and stakeholders are up to date on prevailing risks. Awareness of the risks and safeguards available is the first line of protection on the long road towards security. The speakers discussed data security as a key organisational risk that affects us all irrespectively of the line of business.. Never before has the balancing act between cost and benefit in information security been more critical. There were presentations of innovative methodologies, good practices and case studies to sensitize employees to information security risks and remind them of the basic golden rules. The newly released video clips of ENISA on awareness raising have been officially launched with a view to spearheading raising information security awareness across Europe. ENISA‘s set of downloadable video clips, are a great tool for promoting information security awareness. Here are some comments on the event and videos: “A very helpful joint effort both that addresses real world problems in theory and practice.

ENISA_PR_1268	2009-05-28	PR	Improving Resilience: 3 recommendations.	     The European Network and Information Security Agency [ENISA] launches two reports with three recommendations on emerging, new technologies and their potential to improve the resilience of communication networks. Technologies have been developed with properties that improve both the resilience and security of the Internet. Experience is missing in the area of commercial operation of these features, as well as operational best practices and recommendations in applied network resilience.  Resilience and security of communication networks and services that they support is an issue of critical importance to the EU economy and its citizens, as it impacts day-to-day operation of businesses, affecting daily lives of EU citizens. ENISA carried out an assessment of three key technologies Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS), Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) and Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) regarding their potential to provide increased network resilience. This analysis was carried out from two perspectives. The first consisted of analysing the characteristics of the selected technologies and their public communication network's resilience enhancing features. In parallel, the effectiveness of these technologies, as well as problems and gaps that potentially could compromise the availability of networks and services was assessed through interviews of twelve network operators in the EU Member States. The key findings of the analysis are: The assessed technologies can improve both the resilience and security of the Internet. Commercial operation experience is missing for some of the technologies. There are neither operational best practices nor recommendations for applied network resilience. There is lack of management and coordination between stakeholders. The Agency commented: “The recent spotlight in the news on networks unavailability, caused by cyber attacks and physical phenomena, highlights the urgency and the importance of ENISA’s work on improving the resilience of public communications. This is an area vital for European e-government, e-business and ultimately, the economy.” The three key recommendations are: Resilient connectivity of European organisations must be ensured. European expertise, best practice and operational experience must be exploited. The existence of European trained experts should be ensured. Background ENISA’s Multiannual Thematic Program has the objective to improve the resilience of public eCommunications in Europe.

It provides high level and context specific recommendations to both policy and decision makers. The report concludes with a list of identified good practices. The study was done in the context of ENISA’s program on Resilience of public communication networks. The report recommends that: Member States may consider soft-law instruments (e.g. good practices and recommendations) as a means to intervene in the market Member States may consider simplification and harmonisation of competences (abilities, faculties) and tasks of relevant national authorities Member States may consider developing and implementing an integrated and holistic national risk management process Member States should consider assessing the degree of operators’ adherence to preparedness measures Each Member State must establish one national Computer Emergency Response Team, i.e. 'CERT' Member States expressed the need for more good practice guidance on emerging policy issues (e.g. trusted information sharing exchanges, incident reporting, exercises) The European Commission should consider the development and implementation of a coherent pan European strategy based on Member States’ experiences The Agency commented: “This work underpins Member States’ efforts to debate and co-operate on this issue in a more structured manner. ENISA firmly responds to Member States needs by developing good practices on information sharing, incident reporting and exercises” These results constitute the basis of ENISA’s contributions to the European Commission (or EU) strategy on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP).

ENISA_PR_1273	2009-03-20	PR	Remote health monitoring scenario	 The EU Agency ENISA [European Network and Information Security Agency] today released its report presenting major potential Emerging and Future Risks [EFR] in a possible remote health monitoring and treatment scenario. The report is the result of an Emerging and Future Risk assessment based on scenario building and analysis. E-health is the first scenario that has been developed and analyzed by an international group of interdisciplinary experts. In the report 14 risks have been identified. It also underlines the importance of a cautionary approach to be followed in regards to the adoption of beneficial e-health solutions: “Caution seems to be the prudent answer at this point: the benefits are clear, but also the risks entailed cannot be ignored”.In our scenario Ralph is a diabetic, enrolled in a remote health monitoring and treatment programme. He goes about his daily business wearing a special vest with biosensors, keeping track of his vital signs, ensuring rapid response from doctors, while his personal data may be literally flowing around, in order to enable this kind of service. This scenario shows us that remote health schemes undoubtedly offer a great potential. Many benefits can be identified for citizens’ wellbeing and quality of life, but what are the risks entailed? It seems that e-health solutions are very important and beneficial. At the same time, they may generate serious considerations, regarding security, privacy, data protection and legal, as well as in the social, political and ethical area In the course of the study, the major assets that are to be protected, e.g. health, life, human rights, etc, have been identified. Based on this, the most important risks generated regarding these assets are subsequently identified and further analysed. This is following a comprehensive risk assessment approach, as developed by ENISA in the context of the Emerging and Future Risks Framework. In a nutshell, the report draws the attention to 14 major risks in total, among them breaches of data protection legislation, mission creep meaning secondary use of data, intrusive data surveillance and profiling by insurance companies, employers, credit-checking companies, etc, data loss or theft, system failures and service disruption. The Agency commented: “With the development of the EFR capacity, the agency aims at early identification of risks for new application areas and/or technologies. This will help developers and policy makers understand the impacts of new application and manage the resulting risks. At the example of the analyzed e-Health scenario ENISA underlines the risks of an overly optimistic approach to e-health, driven by the industry. While such initiatives and services are undoubtedly beneficial and worth deploying for the general good, we must at least identify and understand the various challenges posed and need to be overcome, in particular in respect to security and privacy.” Full report Annex I: Scenario building and analysis template Annex II: Risk analysis report FAQ 	https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/remote-health-monitoring-scenario
ENISA_PR_1274	2009-02-19	PR	Risks and SMEs	" Security for SMEs is crucial for Europe’s economy, as they represent 99% of all enterprises in the EU and ca 65 Mn jobs. As SMEs need simple, flexible, efficient and cost-effective security solutions, ENISA produced a simplified RM/RA approach for SMEs. The simplified approach is a ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution created for non-expert users and for small organisations with relatively simple IT-components. This approach has now been validated in this report. The pilot study had a threefold objective: Validate the content of the simplified approach,Evaluate the applicability of the proposed RM/RA approach, andCollect feedback and proposal for changes. Three multiplier organizations from different business sectors were selected by ENISA to validate the pilot, as to reach out to as many SMEs/micro-enterprises as possible; GMV Soluciones Globales Internet (Spain), Outsourcer of Information Security Services, IAAITC (UK), Accounting association, and University of Bologna (Italy), public administration/education. Each multiplier brought in representative SMEs/micro-enterprises from their sector.The following conclusions can be drawn from the pilot study: The ENISA simplified RA/RM approach received a generally high level of appreciation from the ca 15 MEs and SMEs involved in the pilot. The ENISA simplified RM/RA approach led to an increased level of awareness on the fundamental role of Information Security Risk Assessment and Management. Companies involved in the project were more motivated to improve their information security management approaches. It is unlikely that both SMEs and micro-enterprises could use the RM/RA simplified approach without at least initial, external support. Some simplifications/automated steps might be required to better target the audience of very small and micro enterprises. The multipliers agreed on the need to introduce some customizations to the ENISA approach (e.g. sector-based and market-segment-based etc.). ENISA’s strategy to involve multiplier organizations in the pilot was accepted by all participants. A further involvement of such partners is necessary. The study will e.g., serve as a road-map for future ENISA activities in the area of SMEs. The Agency commented: ""We all know that the SMEs constitute the basis of Europe’s economy. Therefore the validation of a simplified risk management approach for these companies is crucial. With this approach, the necessary steps and appropriate measures for increased security can be taken.""

ENISA_PR_1275	2009-02-03	PR	Privacy and eID	 Today, ten national eID card schemes are already in use across the EU and thirteen more are in the pipeline. Presently, eID cards are used primarily by e-government services, eg, for taxation, but there are also commercial applications of eID cards. Many more eservices are planned in the near future, using the data on the card for anything from secure chat to library access and piggybacking on the infrastructure investments which have been made. In all these applications, the eID card is a gateway to personal information, be it at national or European level. At the same time, it is key to address privacy concerns related to eID: unwanted disclosure of data and subsequent misuse. The ENISA Position Paper points out that privacy features have been developed, implemented and tested at a national level only. There is no co-ordinated strategy at European level addressing which [and how] features should be implemented and this is an important obstacle for cross border eID interoperability. This is a major hurdle for the acceptance of eID cards and their usage in day-to-day applications. ENISA’s Position Paper provides the first comprehensive overview of the state of play in Europe - an essential step towards improving the base-line of citizen privacy and protection in eID cards across Europe. The paper charts how available privacy-enhancing technologies are implemented in existing and planned European eID card specifications. The paper analyses in detail eleven risks to personal privacy resulting from the use of national electronic identity card schemes. It also lists eight practicable techniques available to address and mitigate these risks. Furthermore, through eight comparison charts, the Position Paper maps out the situation of available privacy features in existing cards. With numerous references to national specifications, it is a good starting point for identifying best practices and a source of reference for future choices to be made by European policy makers. The Agency commented: “Privacy is an area where the member states' approaches differ a lot and European eID will not take off unless we get this right. Europe needs to reflect on eID privacy and its role in the interoperability puzzle. The fundamental human right to privacy must be guaranteed for all European eID card holders. Therefore, ENISA will continue to work in this field in 2009.” Full position paper 	https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/privacy-and-eid
ENISA_PR_1276	2009-01-29	PR	Report on European eIDM	" Security and interoperability of eID systems across Europe is a current topic. European eID Management [eIDM] presently stands at crossroads. This is a vital and delicate stage, as pilot studies and models are now transformed into actual working systems. The ENISA report is a milestone, as it is the Agency’s first experts’ snapshot of Europe’s state of play in eIDM. The study charts the origins and scope of European eID interoperability. It focuses specifically at the triangle of three intrinsically connected drivers: At Policy level; an examination of the eID Roadmap, and the eID -2010 goals to be reached by 2010. The recently initiated 20 Mn € STORK Project is analysed, as one of several EU projects focusing on eID. This initiative develops a series of pilot projects for citizens of 13 EU Member States, using their governments’ eID/authentication systems. Thus, the STORK project pilots a basic infrastructure in the EU for cross-border eID systems. But, the report strongly underlines that although STORK is significant, it is not to be seen as the panacea for all eID interoperability problems. Many European eIDM projects overlap but the solution does not lie in any single project. Instead the outcomes of all eID building blocks must eventually be put together to create a coherent and pragmatic infrastructure for European eID interoperability. Third, the report examines the implementation of the Services Directive. The Directive requires Member States to put electronic points of single contact in place by 28 Dec. 2009. By then, service providers from any Member State should be able to complete formalities, to offer their services and to identify themselves electronically in a reliable way. The report identified the four main policy priorities for European eIDM: In 2009, the policy objectives of the eID Roadmap will need to be reviewed and updated. To examine the results of the STORK project and how the pilot infrastructure can be expanded into a full-scale system. Once an interoperability infrastructure is in place, Member States will need to decide on the security requirements of their applications which do not discriminate against foreign citizens and enterprises. A greater emphasis on the citizen-centric approach to eID. It is crucial to give users sufficient personal control over their identity. The Agency commented: “This report shows that the pioneer eID systems soon must move into interoperable systems. This is a crucial time for EU Member States to make the right decisions, not only to guarantee interoperability, but also security and usability.""

ENISA_PR_1277	2009-01-22	PR	Networks downtime only 10 hrs/year	 The EU Agency ENISA [the European Network and Information Security Agency] launches a report on resilience of communication networks. The survey reveals a better than expected network availability, with only 10 hours downtime a year. Availability is vital not only to business, but also to private consumers. Service providers show a higher level of service to both actors than expected. Downtime on your network? The ENISA survey nevertheless shows that there is only 10 hours downtime a year and over 99.9% availability. The availability of networks, services and business continuity is of major concern for all business actors and consumers alike across Europe. As the number of disruptions increases, network operators and service providers put measures in place to ensure the resilience of public communication networks. However, today there are significant differences in the approaches deployed by network operators and service providers across Europe. The ENISA survey of network operators across the EU, polled by the end of 2008, is based on 54 responses. The survey found that operators take network resilience seriously: Top network threats are hardware, software and location incidents, but also personnel incidents were also significantly represented. Operators describe their network and risk management procedures as fairly mature. There is no significant variation by size of operator regarding business continuity procedures. The Agency commented: “It was reassuring to find how well both small and bigger network operators and service providers manage their network availability” Some key conclusions: Some alternative operators, however, are not placing enough priority on resilience. Alternative operators vary widely and are often very small. As such, resilience recommendations may not apply e.g. if they do not operate infrastructure critical to public welfare. This ambiguity leads to difficulty for policy-makers as to try to develop industry standards and recommendations for Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Such efforts should be optional, or limited to infrastructure critical to public welfare. IDC recommends the production of guidelines for operators to improve the resilience and operations of their networks. The report was Commissioned by ENISA and executed by the IDC. The survey represents a variety of size, services offered, etc, of telecoms operators distributed across 17 of the EU27. The full survey addresses: 1. Threats to the networks, 2. Organisational factors in managing resilience, 3. Maturity of network management processes, 4. Business Continuity planning, 5. Managing third-party dependencies, and 6. Risk management. Full report FAQ Background: Resilience characterises those networks that provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults which affect their normal operation: where faults should be invisible to users. This study is done in the context of ENISA’s multi annual thematic program on Resilience of public communication networks. 	https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/pc-downtime-only-10-hrs-year

ENISA_NEWS_1279	2008-06-12	NEWS	ENISA Brokers Sharing of Good CERT Practice 	 On 11-12th June 2008, Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) representatives from CERT-Hungary, the Bulgarian State Agency for Information Technology and Communications and ENISA met in Budapest, Hungary to exchange good practices in setting up a governmental CERT or Gov-CERT. A previous meeting took place in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 22nd April 2008. During these meetings, good practices have been shared and training provided to Bulgaria, which is working on establishing a national Gov-CERT. Cooperation between Bulgaria and Hungary began in 2007. ENISA facilitates this successful collaboration in the context of the European NIS Good Practice Brokerage as established under the auspices of the Agency’s Work Programme.Since 2007, ENISA has acted as broker between those willing to share and those wanting to learn good practice in certain NIS areas. As such, the Agency supports, for instance, the brokerage between Finland-Slovenia on awareness raising and Dutch-Hungarian discussions on a structured cyber crime-related information exchange, to be expanded to other countries. In addition, ENISA is preparing to support Finland in their cooperation with South Africa to develop a CERT for the latter. 	https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa-brokers-sharing-of-good-cert-practice
