CDT_NEWS_0001	2021-03-20	NEWS	The Centre supports the ‘Relais pour la Vie 2021’	 During 24 hours between Saturday and Sunday, participants will walk, run or cycle for thirty minutes or more. The 24-hour relay is usually held on an indoor track, but this year the team effort must involve people running on their own. At the Centre, we will set up a videoconference session during the relay so that team members can connect during their slots and show their involvement. At the beginning and end of each slot, the team members will enter the virtual room to hand over the digital baton. Other colleagues, relatives and friends will be able to connect any time to meet and chat in the virtual room. The relaying may be virtual, but the running, walking and cycling as well as everyone’s support will be very real! The event, symbolising the testing path cancer patients follow in their fight against cancer, has the triple objective of providing moral support for patients, collecting funds and raising public awareness about cancer. The opening and closing ceremonies will take place online at 16:00 and will be accessible through the ‘Relais pour la vie’ website, which also provides plenty of interesting ideas to organise digital fundraising events to support the Foundation. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/centre-supports-relais-pour-la-vie-2021
CDT_NEWS_0002	2021-02-24	NEWS	The Centre’s key achievements in 2020	 Between its establishment in 1994 and the end of 2020, the Centre translated almost 13.4 million pages, both into and from the 24 official EU languages and several other non‑EU languages, covering over 800 language pairs in total. In terms of the translation volume in 2020, almost 335 000 pages were for documents and over 300 000 pages were EU trade marks for the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) based in Alicante. In 2020, for the first time ever, the volume of documents exceeded the volume of trade marks. In addition to the translation, modification, editing and revision of documents, the Centre provided various other language services. Some 1 448 days were spent on terminology work and 49 277 term list entries were translated. The need for video subtitling was reconfirmed, with 11 clients ordering a total of 1 601 minutes of this service. For all  language services, the Centre is committed to on-time delivery, and in 2020 it met its deadlines in 99.7% of cases, with only a 3% renegotiation rate. 2020 was the second and final year of implementation of the Centre’s Transformation Plan, covering four areas (translation technology, human resources, quality and client orientation, and institutional aspects). This aimed to introduce structural changes and put in place an optimised business model based on state-of-the-art translation technologies with added value services for clients. As part of this, a separate programme with the EUIPO covered a number of specific IT projects of strategic importance for both organisations. The article ‘Final sprint towards our transformation’ (December 2020) provides an overview of the implementation of this ambitious parallel programme. On behalf of its interinstitutional partners, the Centre continued to manage the EU database IATE ('InterActive Terminology for Europe') which is the terminology reference not only for language professionals, but also for national experts, policy advisers, public administrations, academics and private sector companies. The technical work in 2020 focused on continuous user support and the implementation of numerous change requests. In total, nine IATE releases were completed in 2020. The Centre signed a cooperation agreement with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) and in 2021 will start offering a specific on-site machine translation solution built in collaboration with the European Commission. This brought the Centre’s client portfolio up to 69 clients by the end of 2020. Throughout 2020, the Centre provided exceptional language support in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. It proactively offered its services to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to facilitate smooth communication between the agency and its experts and the public at large in a wide range of languages. Likewise, the Centre supported the European Medicines Agency (EMA) by translating important information on Covid-19 into all EU languages. In addition, on behalf of the IATE partners, the Centre ran an external communication campaign to raise public awareness of the IATE collections of terms related to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 swiftly created by terminologists from the various EU language services in 2020. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/centres-key-achievements-2020
CDT_NEWS_0003	2020-12-18	NEWS	Our best wishes for 2021!	 The Centre has proved to be not only structurally robust but also agile over the recent months of disruptions caused by Covid-19. When the Centre sent the vast majority of its staff to work from home full time in March, our activities were not interrupted in any way and we were able to continue to serve our clients, whilst bringing the transformation plan to a successful conclusion. Thanks to this plan, we have been able to launch new services, optimise our workflows and create new platforms for internal and external collaboration. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to our stakeholders for their cooperation throughout this very atypical year. We wish each and every one of you a relaxing festive period and, above all, a healthy and prosperous 2021. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/our-best-wishes-2021

CDT_NEWS_0005	2020-12-17	NEWS	New services as from January 2021: Automatic Transcription, Automatic Translation, Paste ‘n’ Go	 Combining our know-how with the use of the most advanced and accessible technologies has allowed us to extend the service offer for our clients. From the start of 2021, they will thus be able to benefit from the following three new services: Automatic Transcription, Automatic Translation and Paste ‘n’ Go, the first two resulting from the fruitful cooperation with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO): Automatic transcription complements the transcription service already available since June this year and builds entirely on the reliable speech-to-text technology integrated into our production workflow. This service may be advantageous for clients who need the written text of a recording quickly, but not necessarily with 100% accuracy. Automatic translation represents the first step on our way towards modularising our flagship product ‘Translation’. This service relies on the Centre’s custom machine translation engines in combination with our translation memories. The fully automated processing of incoming requests will result in sufficiently comprehensible translations in a very short time and at a highly attractive price. The Paste ‘n’ Go service has been designed to speed up the process of creating requests and retrieving translations of short, unformatted texts through a dedicated web form on our Client Portal. It will enable clients to reduce costs and turnaround times while obtaining a high-quality translation thanks to a partially automated workflow and the involvement of the Centre’s expert linguists. The Centre’s diversified service offer responds to our clients’ evolving business language needs and is a proof of our commitment to finding innovative solutions for their future challenges.   Link to Transcription leaflet Link to Modularising translation leaflet  	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/new-services-january-2021-automatic-transcription-automatic-translation-paste-n-go
CDT_NEWS_0006	2021-03-08	NEWS	Empowering gender equality through words	 Can terminology be a source of empowerment? How can we describe situations or phenomena without the right words? You could argue that if something cannot be named, it might as well not exist. Terminological resources such as the IATE terminology database and EIGE’s Gender Equality Glossary and Thesaurus can help individuals and groups find a voice in multiple languages. One of the great features of IATE, which is managed by the Centre on behalf of the interinstitutional IATE partners, is that you can use filters to retrieve terms under specific domains (see the IATE User’s Handbook). People interested in gender equality can use specific keywords to access all the related terms available in IATE, in up to 24 languages. We recommend trying these keywords: rights and freedoms [LAW]; equal treatment [LAW > rights and freedoms > social rights]; gender equality [LAW > rights and freedoms > social rights]; working conditions [EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS > organisation of work and working conditions]. Around 300 of these IATE entries were prepared by the Centre as part of its collaboration with the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) located in Austria and the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) based in Lithuania, which have been clients of ours for many years. For EIGE, we contributed to the creation of the Gender Equality: Glossary of terms and concepts, published on EIGE’s website in 2018. This glossary covers 410 concepts and was developed for the purpose of fostering a common understanding of gender equality terminology across the EU and promoting gender-fair and inclusive language. The glossary’s concepts were selected from key regulatory and policy documents of the EU institutions, the Council of Europe and the United Nations, as well as from studies, reports and scientific articles. The Centre provided the equivalent terms in all the EU languages. There are several gender equality glossaries available online but many are only monolingual tools. What makes the IATE and EIGE resources exceptional is their multilingual facet, providing broader access to gender-fair and inclusive language for more linguistic communities. This is an outstanding achievement considering the scarcity of such terms in certain languages. Let’s continue in our efforts to create synergies between gender equality, multilingualism and terminology and embrace the new opportunities these might offer. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/empowering-gender-equality-through-words
CDT_NEWS_0007	2020-12-17	NEWS	Final sprint towards our transformation	 The Transformation Plan 2019-2020 covers four areas (translation technology; human resources; quality and client orientation; and institutional aspects) as shown in the picture above. The main aims of the plan were to introduce structural changes, implement state-of-the-art translation technologies, including machine translation, and create new services for clients. The transformation process included a separate programme agreed with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), covering a number of specific IT projects of strategic importance for both organisations. What are the main achievements? As a result of our intense cooperation with the EUIPO, we have: developed new services for our clients, such as transcription based on automatic speech recognition, which was launched in June this year, and we have optimised some of our existing services, such as subtitling, language consultancy and translation. In January 2021, we will start offering new services in the areas of translation and transcription; launched our first mobile application eCdT4me, available both on Google Play Store and Apple App Store, which allows our clients as well as our freelance and in-house translators to stay connected and interact with us on language service requests; enhanced our workflows through the integration of relevant tools, thus yielding efficiency and quality gains for us and our clients: Euramis, eTranslation, the Centre’s own custom machine translation engines in the fields of public health and intellectual property, and IATE are now fully embedded in the Centre’s translation process and workflow management activities. Moreover, a new user-friendly translation feedback interface, based on the Corrected Version Request (CVR) and fully connected to the Centre’s Client Portal and workflow management system eCdT, has replaced the former Client Satisfaction Form (CSF) process; come up with a new annual survey approach to measure client satisfaction, which will be put in place from Q1/2021. This will allow the Centre to better monitor the activity status and satisfaction level for each client and enhance client management. In addition, the Centre invested in other enhancements aimed at facilitating our clients’ work, such as the budgetary forecast functionality now available on the Client Portal, or the web translation module for Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 based websites. We have also established the Workflow Management Section as a single operational contact point for our clients. The Section is now managing all workflow steps, from the receipt of the request to the ‘after-sales’ service, as well as the Client Portal. Moreover, the actions included in our transformation plan have enabled us to gain efficiency in the area of human resource management and to invest in specific training for our staff (e.g. post-editing of machine translation; transcription; optimised subtitling; management of translation memories). At the start of 2021, as part of the implementation of Activity Based Management (ABM), Activity Based Budgeting (ABB) and Activity Based Costing (ABC) at the Centre, we will be using a new system for activity and resource allocation. Finally, over the last two years we have fostered interinstitutional cooperation. It is well worth mentioning here that the progress achieved by the Centre in the field of machine translation and its close cooperation with the Commission’s DG Translation have recently made it possible for us to sign an agreement with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) on a service offer tailored to the Office’s needs. It should also be noted that our eCdT workflow management system has obtained a lot of interest from the EU institutions’ translation services. Likewise, we are regularly sharing our experience in the areas of automatic speech recognition, transcription and subtitling with our institutional partners. Most importantly, however, our transformation has helped us to consolidate the Centre as a modern EU language service provider and has opened up new business opportunities. More than ever, we are happy to see our clients turn to us for our expert advice in response to their specific multilingual needs, be it for website localisation, a review of their multilingual strategy, management of workflows and requests involving Member States, non-EU translations or transcription work. The transformation plan has enabled us to move from a one-size-fits-all language service provider to a service provider with a richer, more diversified offer that responds to clients’ specific needs.       	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/final-sprint-towards-our-transformation
CDT_NEWS_0008	2020-06-15	NEWS	EU terminologists against COVID podcast	 The interview is a very interesting conversation, covering many concrete examples, on how COVID-19 terminology has been developed in IATE, the interinstitutional terminology database of the European Union. Paula Zorrilla-Agut (IATE Tool Manager at CdT) gave a brief overview of the IATE system, its target audience, and how its content and functionalities have evolved. She also gave some details on the management of collections and on the list of COVID-19 terminology that is shared with public users on some EU platforms. Ninetta Kapetanaki (Terminology Coordinator at the Commission’s DGT) and Ingrid Swinnen (Terminology Coordinator at the Council of the EU) explained in detail how the various institutions cooperated with one another on this project, and also discussed their institution-specific needs regarding COVID-19 terminology and how IATE has been enriched with concepts and language equivalents in this domain. They presented different examples of concepts that were not being used consistently in the media and that required very thorough research and documentation in the respective IATE entries, e.g. ‘coronavirus’ versus ‘COVID-19’, ‘outbreak’ versus ‘pandemic’, ‘physical distancing’ versus ‘social distancing’, ‘cross-border worker’ versus ‘frontier worker’. Don’t miss the details, on https://webcast.ec.europa.eu/eu-terminologists-against-covid (webcast) or https://www.podomatic.com/podcasts/dgtradiolingvistika/episodes/2020-05-25T09_13_31-07_00 (podcast)!   More about IATE IATE was made available to the general public in 2007 and receives around 200 000 queries per day from nearly 200 countries. The Translation Centre manages IATE on behalf of the IATE partners, i.e. the European Parliament, the Council, the European Commission, the Court of Justice, the European Central Bank, the European Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the European Committee of the Regions and the European Investment Bank.   More about DGT Academy – Radio Lingvistika Run by the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Translation, Radio Lingvistika holds a series of educational radio conversations on multilingualism and linguistic issues.

CDT_NEWS_0009	2020-08-28	NEWS	A brand-new after-sales service system for our clients	 As the shared language service provider for the EU agencies and other EU bodies and institutions, the Translation Centre has always paid particular attention to ensuring the high quality of its products and meeting its stakeholders’ requirements. With this aim in mind, since 2001, the Centre has had a free after-sales service in place. This was originally based on the Client Satisfaction Form (CSF) which allowed clients to express their satisfaction and submit feedback on the language services provided by the Centre, including requests for fully revised documents. Following on from that, in 2011, the Centre launched its Client Portal, specifically developed to facilitate operational activities with clients. This is when the CSF was converted into an online form which could be accessed securely by clients’ in-house and national competent authority experts. Since then, an impressive total of 21792 CSFs have been successfully processed by the Centre in close cooperation with its clients. With the introduction of its workflow management system, eCdT, in 2016, which integrates the Client Portal, the Centre began looking at its processes for measuring client satisfaction and handling client feedback. The objective was to optimise the current system taking account of the latest trends in the field of feedback and evaluation services, technological advances and clients’ ideas and observations collected throughout the years. After a detailed review, the Centre decided to embark on a project with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) aimed at developing a new solution which would separate measuring client satisfaction from handling client feedback. As a result of this project, from 28 August 2020 onwards, an enhanced after-sales system, based on the Corrected Version Request (CVR) and fully integrated in eCdT, will become available to both clients and the Centre’s staff, covering the needs of all actors involved in the workflow. The main purpose of the CVR is for clients to ask the Centre to review the feedback submitted by their in-house or national subject matter experts on linguistic output delivered by the Centre, and to provide them with an updated version. Measuring client satisfaction will henceforth primarily take place through regular surveys linked to clients’ operational data to help them assess the service quality offered by the Centre. The new CVR fully embedded in the production workflow and the regular client satisfaction surveys will remain cornerstones of the Centre’s quality assurance system, which aims to provide sustained and reliable high quality over time in line with our clients’ needs and expectations. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/brand-new-after-sales-service-system-our-clients

CDT_NEWS_0011	2020-11-20	NEWS	The European Public Prosecutor's Office becomes the Centre’s 69th client	 Given the confidential nature of the documents to be handled by the EPPO, the Centre and the Office have agreed on a specific on-premise machine translation solution, namely Custom Machine Translation as a Service, which will be available 24/7 to the client. Building on the work undertaken by the European Commission, and the Centre’s own activities in the area of machine translation technology, this service is based on dedicated, secure and customised automatic translation software. In practical terms, the Centre’s service package for the EPPO will include the provision of all necessary resources, including management of the solution, and the periodic linguistic maintenance, quality control and assessment of the translation engines. The signing of this agreement illustrates again that the Centre can offer to its clients, not only traditional services, but also tailor-made services, by combining attentive listening to clients' needs, flexibility to adapt working methods, use of technological advances, and inspiration from its long-standing experience. The Centre looks forward to helping the EPPO effectively carry out its important mission for the benefit of EU citizens.   The EPPO: The EU’s answer to fighting crimes against the EU budget In October 2017, the Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, creating the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO). Since then, the EPPO has been establishing its operational structure at all levels and the Office will be operational in early 2021. The mission of this new and independent EU body is to fight large-scale crime, with powers to investigate and prosecute crimes committed against the EU budget through fraud or corruption. In this way, the EU provides itself with a supranational and cross-border mechanism to protect its financial interests and avoid significant economic damage. The EPPO is located in Luxembourg and, to date, the participating countries are 22 out of the 27 EU Member States: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. In September 2019, the European Parliament and the Council appointed Ms Laura Codruta Kövesi as the first European Chief Prosecutor. In July 2020, the Council appointed the 22 prosecutors representing the Member State participants.   More information on the EPPO is available here and in this video: Image: EPPO video, European Commission 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/european-public-prosecutors-office-becomes-centres-69th-client
CDT_NEWS_0012	2020-05-08	NEWS	Celebrating 70 years since the creation of the European Union	 On 9 May 1950, the French foreign minister Robert Schuman made an appeal for the creation of a European Coal and Steel Community that would bring nations to work together. Some of his words in what is known as the Schuman Declaration still resonate today: ‘World peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it’. In times of crisis such as the one we are currently experiencing, it is important that we ‘stand together’, as the European Commission's president Ms von der Leyen rightly says. We do indeed need to make creative efforts and also think about and recognise the achievements, as well as the added value, that the European Union has brought about. One such achievement is that the EU has united people of different cultural and linguistic backgrounds, which has largely been made possible through the EU's multilingual policy. There are 24 official languages in the Union today, and a great number and variety of texts are regularly translated into all of them, thus giving EU citizens access to important information and facilitating communication. That this can take place is thanks to the various translation services of the EU administration, i.e. the European Parliament, the European Council/the Council of the EU, the European Commission, the Court of Justice, the European Central Bank, the European Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the European Committee of the Regions, the European Investment Bank and the Translation Centre. To celebrate – online this year – both Europe Day and the enormous value of multilingualism together, a video has been produced by the Translation Centre on behalf of the EU translation services. It talks of the beginning of the Union, and the gradual increase in the number of official EU languages in line with successive enlargements. The video illustrates what Robert Schuman said in his declaration: ‘Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity’. Link to the video: https://youtu.be/IUUo7LcMOMw This video has also been made available on the platform launched by the European Commission's Representation in Luxembourg to mark this year's Europe Day. We hope you enjoy it and we wish everyone a ‘Happy Europe Day’ in all the official EU languages.

CDT_NEWS_0013	2020-08-26	NEWS	The Translation Centre trains students on translation workflow management	 In the framework of this collaboration, a group of Postgraduate, Master’s and BA students following the course on specialised translation at KU Leuven had the opportunity to work on real-life translation requests handled by the Centre. The complexity of the projects in terms of format of the files to be translated, language combinations, deadlines and tools to be used made it an interesting business case for the university. Under the guidance of the Centre’s Translation Support Workflow Administrator and the university’s professor in charge of the postgraduate course, students were asked to organise the jobs among themselves and get them done by the requested deadlines. Students were split into several groups, and each person was responsible for one or more roles in the workflow: project managers, translators and revisers. On the basis of the source material provided by the Centre, the project managers split the jobs according to the resources available at their end, prepared projects with the aid of various CAT tools, used machine translation and made sure to post-edit their work. The project preparation was a huge challenge. Students had to consider the format of the files to be translated, the specific instructions given by the Centre and the deadlines to be respected. During this phase, the Centre was systematically consulted as if it were dealing with a real language service provider and provided answers accordingly. Students provided translations from English into Dutch, German, Greek, Spanish, French, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian and Turkish, and also from Russian into English. In all cases, the texts to be translated were in specialised domains such as “job specialised skills and competences”, “railway” and “banking”. Once the translations had been delivered to the Centre, the project management and translations were evaluated by the Centre’s staff. This exercise proved to be very inspirational for both parties. The Centre could appreciate the specialised skills of students who had not yet entered the real world of work, while the students had the opportunity to become familiar with real-life requests and have first-hand experience of the challenges of the world of translation. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/translation-centre-trains-students-translation-workflow-management

CDT_NEWS_0016	2020-03-23	NEWS	The Centre’s key achievements in 2019	 By the end of 2019, and since its establishment in 1994, the Centre had translated almost 12.8 million pages, both into the 24 official EU languages and from and into various non‑EU languages, amounting to over 700 language combinations in total. Of the total translation volume in 2019, almost 310 000 pages were documents and almost 349 000 pages consisted of EU trade marks for the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) based in Alicante. In addition to translation, modification, editing and revision of documents, the Centre also provided various other language services. Some 1 129 person-days were devoted to terminology work and 41 000 term list entries were translated. The need for video subtitling was once again confirmed: 10 clients ordered a total of 2 571 minutes of this service. For all the language services it provides to clients, the Centre is committed to on-time delivery and it met its deadlines in 99.9% of cases, with only a 4% renegotiation rate. The Transformation Plan 2019-2020 covers four areas (translation technology, human resources, quality and client orientation, and institutional aspects), and it had a good first year as shown in the picture above. The aim of the plan is to introduce structural changes and implement a financially sustainable business model based on translation technologies, including machine translation, and new services for clients. The Centre’s transformation process includes a separate programme agreed with the EUIPO covering a number of specific projects (see the building in the middle of the picture above with project (P) numbers at the bottom of the windows). In 2019, the Centre already achieved several of the defined targets within those projects, such as: the systematic feeding and integration of the Euramis interinstitutional translation memory system; the integration of the IATE interinstitutional terminology database into the translators’ CAT environment; and the option for the Centre’s clients to send their revised translations in bilingual format to update the Centre’s translation memories. The Centre was delighted to sign a cooperation agreement with three new clients in 2019: the European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC); the European Labour Authority (ELA); and the Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW). All of these clients offer promising business opportunities. The Centre’s client portfolio thus consisted of 68 clients by the end of 2019. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/centres-key-achievements-2019
CDT_NEWS_0017	2020-05-05	NEWS	`Stay at home, save lives!´ in 25 languages	 To be precise, the COVID-19 slogan was not ´translated´ into the 24 EU languages but rather ´localised´, i.e. adapted for local audiences. For example, over the past few weeks, some countries preferred to use the familiar ‘you’ for their slogans while others chose the polite form. Likewise, some opted for the singular and others the plural. On our website, you will find 25 versions of the poster, with each language in the forefront and the other ones below. As the Translation Centre is located in Luxembourg, the poster is also available in Luxembourgish. Please feel free to share the poster and, by doing so, remind everyone in their own language how they can contribute to reducing the coronavirus crisis.   Select your language bg cs da de el en es et fi fr ga hr hu it lt lv mt nl pl pt ro sk sl sv lu       	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/stay-home-save-lives-25-languages
CDT_NEWS_0018	2020-05-04	NEWS	Writing for translation	 Many years ago, the Centre produced two booklets entitled Writing for translation / Écrire pour être traduit. The booklets have been updated regularly and published on the Centre’s website in the main working languages of the Centre, English and French, and they are part of the information package given to all new clients. Both language versions were last updated at the end of 2019 to reflect the impact of technology on drafting documents. They therefore include for the first time a chapter on technical aspects to bear in mind when producing documents for translation (13. Show technical awareness / 12. Faites preuve de sensibilité technique). The Centre invites its in-house authors to use the two booklets and encourages all clients to distribute them among their drafting staff and to consult them regularly. Through these booklets and through the presentation that it organises periodically to raise awareness on the same subject, the Centre seeks to coach authors on best practices in drafting texts intended for translation. The Centre also regularly encourages its clients to submit source texts which are technically well-formatted, a sine qua non for the subsequent pre-processing designed to leverage the content of the Centre’s translation memories. Happy reading and do not hesitate to implement the best practices in the booklets when you next draft a document!     	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/writing-translation

CDT_NEWS_0021	2020-04-30	NEWS	COVID-19 multilingual terminology available in IATE	 Over the past few weeks, terminologists from the different translation services of the EU institutions have redoubled their efforts to enrich the interinstitutional terminology database IATE with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 related concepts. Currently, 270 entries, with 9 020 terms in 24 EU languages, have been compiled on the pandemic (data as of 29/04/2020). The leading entry is, as would be expected, ‘COVID-19’, and it can be found at this address: https://iate.europa.eu/entry/result/3588486/all. To enable IATE users to access these 270 entries in one go, an Excel spreadsheet listing all the terms has been produced (see below). The URLs in the second column point to the relevant multilingual entry in the IATE database, some of which are still being updated by terminologists. Users can search in IATE by ID or term, or click directly on the entry link to have a detailed view of a specific concept with all the available metadata (definitions, notes, contexts, etc.). IATE users now benefit from coverage of the topic in their own languages, and this will continue to grow and develop in parallel with requirements. Users have access to accurate and harmonised multilingual content, which will assist them in their work, often completed under very tight deadlines. The database receives an average of 45 million queries per year, which clearly demonstrates its role as a very popular and useful tool for many people. In these difficult times, everyone is doing their best, within their remit, to deal with the coronavirus crisis. EU terminologists therefore hope that IATE users will find this new collection of terms useful.   Useful links The IATE terminology collection around COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 (Excel spreadsheet) Warning: please note that this Excel file is a screenshot of the pandemic-related content available in IATE taken on 29 April 2020. The database is continuously being updated by EU terminologists, and remains the reference source of choice.

CDT_NEWS_0022	2020-01-30	NEWS	Migration of CuriaTerm into IATE	 Having its terminology in the new IATE database enables the Court to benefit from the latest technology, while establishing closer links with other institutions’ terminology data. Switching tools should not have a significant impact on the Court’s methodology for managing terminology, as it will follow the same principles while adapting to the rules in the IATE Handbook. Some features of the CJEU’s terminology entries will be carried over to IATE, such as the identification of legal systems, notes for concepts without equivalence for languages without terms, descriptions at the concept level, the wide use of semantic relations, and specific legal domains under the domain note. Other IATE partners will also be able to adopt some of the CJEU’s practices, like the use of conceptual trees and the distinction between natural and functional equivalents. The CJEU entries in IATE were created by the lawyer-linguists from the Directorate-General for Multilingualism and the terminologists from the Projects and Terminological Coordination Unit’ of the CJEU. Over the coming months, these entries will be grouped into different collections to enable IATE users to identify the relevant concepts in the context of a specific document or case.   	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/migration-curiaterm-iate

Among its missions is to foster entrepreneurship and growth by reducing the administrative burden on small businesses. DG GROW is therefore currently developing the single digital gateway, which aims to facilitate online access to the information, administrative procedures and assistance that citizens and businesses need to operate in another EU country. The information to be translated will include procedures in the areas of travel, work, retirement, transportation, access to education and youth services, health services, starting a business and financial, environmental, employment and taxation rules. As the information in the 28 EU Member States is usually only available in the national language(s), the Commission has undertaken to fund the translation of around 500 web pages per Member State, by signing an arrangement with the Translation Centre. The plan is for all Member States’ websites to be available in the national language(s) and also another language (currently English only but more might be added in the future). The project is scheduled to run over two years (2020/2021); beyond that, web pages may need to be updated periodically. The Translation Centre is pleased to be able to offer its language services to its third European Commission Directorate-General. It has already been working for the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL) since 2003 on the EURES portal and this year on the European Skills/Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) project, and with the Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (DG JUST) since 2015 on the Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform.

CDT_NEWS_0025	2019-12-09	NEWS	Takeaways from the Translating Europe Forum 2019	 The panel discussions centred on areas where translation plays an invaluable role, such as healthcare, crises and disaster relief, and tourism and entertainment, and speakers from various sectors also shared their recent experiences of translation. Two Directorates-General of the Commission, DG GROW and DG JUST, presented the translation projects for their web platforms, namely the Your Europe information web portal and the Online Dispute Resolution platform (translated by the DGT and the Translation Centre). The Banque Cantonale Vaudoise (BCV) talked about how they have included translators in their communication process. For the target text to be turned into good content, translators need to have the necessary background information and be fully involved in the communication workflow – not just right at the end. In the discussion How public institutions and civil society benefit from translation, Amnesty International described some of the challenges they face in their translation work, such as 80+ formats, non-final versions of documents sent for translation (corrections/updates made to texts during translation) and a lack of key information (e.g. gender, references etc.). Microsoft, which relies heavily on machine translation, said that the technology was very fast reaching human parity. However, in their view, what is still missing compared with true human parity is document context, real-world knowledge and non-zero chance of catastrophic mistakes. During the session New frontiers in language technologies, university researchers explained how they are currently exploring options for automatic meeting summarisation (minuting) and optimisation of real-time continuous transcription for interpreters. In Translation in the entertainment sector, Ubisoft looked at video game localisation, where statistics reveal 2.3 billion gamers globally.  ‘Triple A’ (or AAA) games can be likened to bestseller films, and are now localised in 20 languages and dubbed into nine. Multilingualism also forms the basis of arte, the European culture TV channel, where intensive use is made of subtitling, voice-over and dubbing, and translators working in-house are also journalists. The conference was rounded off by a presentation given by Farid Tabaraki, trend watcher and futurist, who believes that by understanding each other, we create a better society. He stated that ‘change is the only permanence and uncertainty is the only certainty’, and that as a society, we are moving from hierarchy to hubs, process to play, scarcity to abundance, entrepreneurs to intrapreneurs and ego to eco. In our rapidly changing world, the Translating Europe Forum 2019 was a great opportunity to reflect on the role of translation and its impact on society. Translation is indeed all around us, and the good news is that there is a bright future for high-quality professionals in the sector, provided they take stock of the fact that new skills and technologies are an indispensable part of the profession today.

CDT_NEWS_0032	2019-11-12	NEWS	Focus on computational and corpus-based phraseology at Europhras 2019	 The three-day programme featured presentations on a range of interdisciplinary topics. These included corpus-based, psycholinguistic and cognitive approaches to the study of phraseology, the computational treatment of multi-word expressions, as well as their practical applications in translation, lexicography and language learning, teaching and assessment. Four international keynote speakers presented new research on computational phraseology. Miloš Jakubíček, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Lexical Computing and a software developer of SketchEngine, gave a talk on automatic methods for extracting multi-word expressions (MWEs) based on standard properties such as fixedness, and the degree to which a multi-word item is frozen as a sequence of words. Aline Villavicencio, Professor at the Department of Computer Science in the University of Sheffield (United Kingdom), presented an overview of the advances in the identification of MWEs, based on the various degrees of peculiarities they display, including lexical, syntactic, semantic and statistical information. Natalie Kübler, Professor of Specialised Translation and Languages for Specific Purposes at the Paris Diderot University, showed how research and practice have evolved in specialised translation studies due to an increased focus on theoretical corpus-based translation. Ruslan Mitkov, Professor at the University of Wolverhampton (United Kingdom), is a renowned expert in natural language processing and the sole Editor of The Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics (Oxford University Press) and Executive Editor of the Journal of Natural Language Engineering (Cambridge University Press). Professor Mitkov gave an interesting talk on the automatic translation of MWEs using comparable corpora. EUROPHRAS 2019 also hosted the fourth Workshop on Multi-word Units in Machine Translation and Translation Technology (MUMTTT 2019), aimed at bringing together researchers working on Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches based on the computational treatment of multi-word units. At the EUROPHRAS 2019 conference, it became clear to all that phraseological data is available like never before thanks to new corpus-based technology and to new algorithms based on computational techniques to identify MWEs clusters. Corpora will continue to grow in the next years and phraseology studies must benefit from this approach. One of the main challenges for Machine Translation continues to be the recognition of phraseology so as to avoid literal translation from the analysis of compositional expressions in the source text. Therefore it is crucial for linguists and engineers to concentrate their efforts on the study and identification of MWEs to enable their automatic identification in large corpora.

CDT_NEWS_0033	2019-07-18	NEWS	Effectively communicating human rights	 Thierry Fontenelle, head of the Translation Department, welcomed the two guests from Vienna, highlighting that FRA was a long-standing client of the Centre. He explained that the main objective of the seminar was to clarify new key concepts in the area of fundamental rights for the Centre’s translators, as its terminology was evolving rapidly. Dorothee Reinfried firstly presented the brochure on ‘10 keys to effectively communicating human rights’.  The brochure, which the Centre translated into 21 languages, came about as a result of FRA’s discovery that public and political interest in, and support for, human rights was on the wane. They therefore decided to compile a brochure on best practices and started a debate to try to secure help not only from stakeholders and interest groups, but also from other expert groups and influencers, such as epistemologists, cognitive scientists, critical discourse analysts, art experts, satirical cartoonists and media specialists.  In her presentation, Dorothee Reinfried talked about FRA's multilingual communication and publications policy, including its publishing and editing processes and upcoming projects.  Next, Magdalena Bielecka presented FRA's quality assurance processes for translations. Numerous different topics were addressed in collaboration with the Centre’s in-house translators. Dorothee Reinfried then looked at the terminology issues that had been submitted by the Centre in advance, and outlined the Agency’s recommendations and preferences for these. Topics included the terminology in the recent LGBTI survey launched by FRA a few weeks previously. Finally, the group discussed the gendering of language. Generally, the audience was of the opinion that gendering should be applied in such a way as to not compromise the readability of a text. The topic of fundamental rights sparked intense interest among participants. The seminar was expedient for discussing terminology preferences and gaining a better understanding of FRA's activities and priorities, and was highly appreciated by all attendees.     	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/effectively-communicating-human-rights

CDT_NEWS_0037	2019-07-30	NEWS	JIAMCATT 2019	 Machine translation (MT) was, as would be expected nowadays, the main topic of the conference. Several discussions showed that various MT solutions have been implemented in a number of organisations in the past few years. Many efforts have been made to develop not only statistical machine translation (SMT) but also neural machine translation (NMT). The European Commission’s NMT solution, eTranslation, has been up and running for some time already in many EU institutions and other organisations, covering all EU languages. In the United Nations family, the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) has achieved very good results with ‘WIPO Translate’. Other smaller organisations have also tested and implemented MT solutions in their workflow by relying on market solutions. Jochem Hummel, the keynote speaker of this year’s JIAMCATT, set the tone for the conference with his presentation entitled “Sunsetting of CAT tools”. The discussions focused on various hot topics such as the increased cognitive effort required in post‑editing; the elevation of terminology from a concept-based approach to a knowledge-based approach; the new skills required by those involved in the translation process; the inclusion of experts in the translation workflow; user interface re-thinking; and change management.  Spread over 12 knowledge café working groups, participants from UN and EU bodies, universities and NGOs brainstormed around the main challenges of specific topics, and proposed solutions. Two Centre representatives took part in the working groups on neural machine translation (NMT), which focused on quality, post-editing and its implications, and the future of computer-assisted translation (CAT) and computer-assisted revision (CAR). One of their conclusions was that nowadays practically no translators translate a sentence from scratch without consulting an existing resource such as translation memories, multilingual corpora (internal or publicly available resources), terminology databases (IATE, UNTERM, FAOTERM, etc.) and MT. In terms of training, this means that translators need to learn post‑editing techniques and be aware of the difference between post-editing – when a translator has to edit the output of a machine translation system – and revision – when a translator revises the translation provided by a human translator. JIAMCATT 2019 also provided the Centre with an opportunity to present its current work on speech recognition technologies. The aim is to automate as much as possible the speech-to-text processes to be applied to transcription and/or subtitling services. Today, more than ever, the future is now – and JIAMCATT was there to remind us. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/jiamcatt-2019

The representatives from international organisations, which included both translators and interpreters, were invited to present the activities of their respective organisations and to reflect upon how universities can adapt their curricula to the new needs and competence profiles of contemporary translators and interpreters in international organisations. The SISU hosts also organised a mock conference on the topic of food safety, which allowed the local Chinese students to provide interpretation in various languages (Chinese, English, French, Spanish and Russian), after which the representatives from international organisations were able to provide the students with useful and constructive feedback on their performance. The third day was devoted to a visit to the Chinese company iFlytek, which specializes in the development of artificial intelligence software and which is recognized as one of the world leaders in the field of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation. iFlytek has more than 12,000 employees and those employees devote impressive financial and human resources to collect masses of speech and textual data in dozens of languages to improve their linguistic technology. They also apply artificial intelligence techniques and neural technologies to different types of fields that go beyond speech recognition and machine translation that cover other domains such as face, image and pattern recognition (e.g. in the medical field). The SISU organisers concluded that the special session of the University Contact Group, which they had organised, marked a crucial milestone in the Translation and Interpretation education in China and highlighted the essential role of the IAMLADP University Contact Group as the linchpin of employers in international organisations and university educators of language professionals. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/iamladp-university-contact-group-special-session-china
CDT_NEWS_0039	2019-09-30	NEWS	2019 International Translation Day	 As the FIT reminds us all on its website, ‘interpreters of indigenous languages give native speakers a chance to fully participate in cultural and political life of society and offer equality of access to basic services such as health care, education, information and justice in their mother tongue. Equality of access, along with freedom of thought, expression and personal opinion, are freedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Languages, and therefore translation, interpreting and terminology, underpin the human rights and fundamental freedoms crucial to sustainable development, inclusive governance, peace and social equity.’ We, at the Translation Centre, welcome FIT’s statement and, on this special day, wish our in-house language teams, our network of external language service providers and all those working in the translation community to ensure that the multiple content produced by the EU agencies, institutions and other EU bodies reaches its target audience a very happy Translation Day!

And while we can’t solve today’s global challenges individually or even on a national level, together in Europe we can lead the way. This is what makes European elections all the more important. To raise awareness about the importance of the elections, the European Parliament has released a campaign film called 'Choose your future'. It features documentary footage of newborns around Europe coming into the world; an emotional moment that comes with a great sense of responsibility for the future well-being of the new life. The children in this film will inherit the decisions we take today.   	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/message-european-parliament
CDT_NEWS_0042	2020-09-23	NEWS	European Day of Languages 2020	 This initiative dates back to 2001, when the Council organised the European Year of Languages for the first time. At the launch in 2001, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe and the European Commissioner for Education and Culture declared in a joint statement that ‘everybody deserves the chance to benefit from the cultural and economic advantages language skills can bring. Learning languages also helps to develop tolerance and understanding between people from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds’. It is in this spirit that, year after year, events have been organised for the European Day of Languages. This year, due to the COVID-19 crisis, celebrations will be taking place online, and will include the following initiatives: The European Commission will hold an online conference on 28 September from 10:00 until 12:00 (registration required by 24 September at the latest), during which guest speakers will discuss the role of language skills in the context of the European Education Area. They will also analyse how to boost foreign language learning and incorporate language diversity and support literacy in all languages in schools. The European Commission’s Directorate-General for Translation (DGT) is running a campaign on social media throughout the month of September to promote the translation profession. The key messages are that we can find translation all around us, that professional translators can be a means of boosting business, and that translation is a modern, highly developed profession that offers plenty of potential for students and young people. The social media accounts used for this campaign are: facebook.com/TranslatingForEurope, facebook.com/translatores, twitter.com/translatores, instagram.com/translatingforeurope, youtube.com/DGTranslation. On 26 September, the European Parliament is organising its Multilingualism Day, offering virtual workshops (prior registration on a ‘first come, first served’ basis is required) on various topics such as ‘A day in the life of a translator and an interpreter’, ‘How do I become a translator or an interpreter?, ‘Translation traineeships’ and ‘How technology is changing the roles and ways of working of translators and interpreters’. For a bit of fun, have a look at the ‘Secret agent’s handbook of language challenges’ designed by the Council of Europe. It contains 51 challenges that encourage language learners to take risks and any opportunities they have to practise a language they are learning outside the classroom. At the Translation Centre, our main purpose being to respond to the translation and language-related needs of the EU agencies, we are fully behind the celebration of the European Day of Languages. It is an initiative that serves to remind us every year that one of the European Union’s key assets is cultural and linguistic diversity. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/european-day-languages-2020
CDT_NEWS_0043	2019-04-10	NEWS	Training for our Hungarian translators in the public health field	 After a presentation of the Translation Centre’s translation workflow and quality assurance model, the two OGYÉI representatives took the floor to describe the structure and operations of the Department for Quality Review of Documents in which they work. They had originally taken the initiative of designing a training course for Hungarian translators working in the field of public health because experience had demonstrated a need to establish translation standards to increase the quality of documents. They firstly gave the training to their colleagues, who work with the product information material translated by either the Centre or the pharmaceutical industry, depending on which regulatory procedure applies. To improve the accessibility of the information, the representatives draw up strict guidelines and internal manuals, which are downloadable from a central database. The next obvious step for the two OGYÉI experts was to extend their training to other interested parties. Around 100 freelance translators and regulatory affairs specialists from the medical-pharmaceutical industry have now attended the course, which consists of two levels (beginners and advanced). The excellent feedback that the pair have received from all parties has confirmed the real need for this structured training. The Centre was therefore delighted to also be able to benefit from OGYÉI’s expertise. Rich and varied course contentThe two-day workshop held at the Centre covered general translation issues and various approaches in translation theory. Some parts of the workshop involved practical sessions where participants tackled problems identified in sample translations, such as word order, problems with the source text/content, grammatical issues, abbreviations, scientific nouns, pharmaceutical expressions, statistics, and terms related to the body’s different biological systems. The participants also discussed various specifics of Hungarian medical translation, including literal translation, compulsory and optional conversion tools in the translator’s toolkit, antonymic translation, syntax errors, text reduction, the correct use of hyphens and dashes and the use of singular versus plural. Valuable information to share with our external language service providersBased on what they learnt in the course, our Hungarian in-house translators have now drafted guidelines and created a term list, which will be integrated as a termbase into the Centre’s CAT tool. These resources will be made available to the Centre’s external language providers, thereby passing on the benefits of the training to all concerned. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/training-our-hungarian-translators-public-health-field
CDT_NEWS_0044	2019-07-17	NEWS	2019 IAMLADP Annual Meeting	 IAMLADP is the biggest network of managers of IOs employing conference and language services providers – mainly translators and interpreters. As such, IAMLADP represents a community of about 10,000 language professionals. The United Nations Department for General Assembly and Conference Management in New York is the permanent Chair of the IAMLADP. As in previous years, the Annual Meeting included an Ideas Fair, where participants were able to present ideas, which were then discussed in a plenary session. Ideas included the need to continue investing in neural machine translation technology and promote it as a complement to human translation, which would be in the interest of the language services. Representatives from various international organisations gave presentations on a variety of topics ranging from language technology and machine translation, to inclusive language, to the new skillsets of translators in our digital world. The Council, for instance, presented its Guide for inclusive communication that aims to combat global unconscious biases through inclusive communication. The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) gave a presentation on speech to text activities and its attempt to apply open-source machine learning technology to the creation of a voice recognition and transcription tool for its IP conferences. One of the highlights of the Annual Meeting was indisputably its ‘peer sessions’. In terms of translation management, it focused on topics such as practices in post-editing of machine translation, and the European Commission DGT's Clear Writing campaign to improve the quality of source documents to be translated. One peer session dealt with the need for IOs to redefine the profile of their translators. With new tasks such as editing, subtitling and the production of audio and video material for podcasts, it is important to identify the new skills required and train translators accordingly. Another highlight of the meeting was undoubtedly the discussion around the host paper drafted by the four hosting institutions entitled ‘New technologies and artificial intelligence in the field of language and conference services’. During the discussion, it was very clear that high-quality multilingualism is the raison d’être of the EU translation services. The question today is not whether translation services should embrace and use new technologies, but how they can best do so. It is therefore crucial to strike the right balance between too much and too little enthusiasm regarding the progress made by artificial intelligence and language technology. It is essential that we understand the potential of these new technologies, and are able to harness their power and recognise and accept their limitations. This means humans must remain at the heart of operations if the translation services are to continue to guarantee the quality which clients have come to expect from them.  Useful links ·         IAMLADP website ·         The Host Paper on ‘New technologies and artificial intelligence in the field of language and conference services’   	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/2019-iamladp-annual-meeting
CDT_NEWS_0045	2019-06-03	NEWS	Fifth Translation Contact Network meeting	 In his opening speech, the Centre’s acting Director, Benoît Vitale, stressed that, since the previous meeting in February 2018, the Centre had successfully implemented a series of large IT projects, such as a fully redesigned Client Portal, a web translation module for websites based on Drupal 7, and a brand-new version of the interinstitutional terminology database IATE. He also highlighted the fact that the Centre had laid the foundations for its future development by integrating machine translation (MT) into its production workflow and starting to build customised MT engines in the fields of public health and intellectual property case-law in close cooperation with its partner DG at the European Commission and its clients. He underlined the importance of the results from the external ‘Study on the Translation Centre as the Linguistic Shared Service Provider for the EU Agencies and Bodies’ conducted in 2017/2018, which had enabled the Centre to establish the priorities to work on in the next 2 years.Finally, he pointed out that the volume of documents translated by the Centre had once again reached a record in 2018 (369 000 pages), which was evidence that there was a lot of interest among the Centre’s clients in upholding multilingualism in the EU in order to reach out to citizens. He said that this was particularly important in view of the forthcoming European elections and the constitution of a new European Commission. After the welcome and the introduction of the day’s agenda, the participants briefly introduced themselves and presented their organisation’s priorities in the field of translation for the current year. Several clients emphasised how important it was to receive fast, reliable, accurate and high-quality translations from the Centre. Many explicitly pointed out that they were very happy with the Centre’s services and the assistance from the Centre’s staff. Several clients expressed their satisfaction with the subtitling service provided by the Centre, while others said they were looking forward to using the Centre’s new web translation service. Other topics on the agenda during the morning session included the Centre’s web translation module for websites based on Drupal 7and the implementation of MT in the workflow. The Centre also presented the outcome of the external study as well as its Transformation Plan for 2019/2020. Based on the study recommendations, the plan consists of four pillars: translation technology; quality and client Orientation; human resources and organisation; and interinstitutional cooperation. The afternoon session was opened by a representative from the Business Communications Service (Customer Department) of the European Union Intellectual Property Office, whose presentation raised awareness among participants of the potential of automatic speech recognition. This is one of the future services that the Center is exploring. What would happen if the Centre were not there to deal with all the aspects of translation projects? This question was addressed in a presentation on the importance of the Centre’s revision of freelance translations. Based on specific examples, the presentation highlighted the added value of the different quality assurance and other in house activities which the Centre’s linguists carry out on a daily basis. This led on to a more wide-ranging discussion on the topic of revision. A number of clients revise the translations received from the Centre either with their in-house experts or with a network of national authorities to make sure that the texts meet the needs of their target audiences. Any feedback from the revision is provided to the Centre via the Client Satisfaction Form (CSF) and handled by the Centre’s translators. The meeting participants discussed how this process could be made less time-consuming for all parties involved while ensuring the best possible translation quality for end users. Another discussion followed on how to best approach the modification of existing documents. Originals and translations often undergo changes at the client’s end as a result of the publication process and thus the Centre’s translation memories do not necessarily reflect the latest status of the documents unless the Centre receives and re-aligns the updated versions. The possible future introduction of a stand-alone alignment service should help to solve this problem. The meeting ended with a presentation of the main features of the new version of IATE (Interactive Terminology for Europe) which was launched in December 2018. This year’s Translation Contact Network was once again an excellent opportunity to meet clients in person, including in the more informal setting of a buffet lunch, and to exchange information and best practices with them. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/fifth-translation-contact-network-meeting
CDT_NEWS_0046	2019-06-27	NEWS	European Commission publishes list of EMT-certified translation schools	 The European Master’s in Translation Network, also known as the EMT Network, is a partnership project between the European Commission and universities and higher education institutions offering translation programmes. Its objective is to facilitate the integration of young translation graduates into the labour market. Last year, the EMT network adopted a competency framework for the period 2018-2024. Higher education programmes that have met the professional standards set out in this document have been awarded the EMT mark issued by the European Commission. Five major areas of competence are defined in the EMT framework: language and culture, translation, technology, personal and interpersonal, and service delivery. During EMT-certified Master’s courses, students become aware that the translation profession is multidimensional and involves more than (simply) conveying a message from one language into another. It requires knowing how to deliver a complete translation service. This covers areas as diverse as looking for clients, professional budgeting tips, management of translation workflow, and administration of linguistic and IT resources. Personal and interpersonal skills (commonly referred to as soft skills) such as the ability to work in a team or to meet deadlines are also increasingly being taught and evaluated. Some of the skills referred to in this reference document illustrate that the translation market has evolved very rapidly. For example, future graduates are now required to know how to post-edit machine translation (MT) output, to be able to assess the relevance of MT systems in a translation workflow, or to know how to use social media responsibly for business purposes. More than at any time previously, the translators of tomorrow will be at a crossroads!   Find out more • List of members of the EMT Network 2019-2024• EMT Network Competency Framework• EMT Network Facebook page 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/european-commission-publishes-list-emt-certified-translation-schools

CDT_NEWS_0048	2020-09-30	NEWS	Finding the words for a world in crisis	 This year, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, FIT pays a well-deserved tribute to translators, terminologists and interpreters on its website: ‘Our profession has been pivoting rapidly to keep up with changing realities and expectations, and the importance of our work to ensuring clear information reaches everyone and overcoming language barriers – both global and local – has been highlighted in unprecedented ways this year. Translators, terminologists and interpreters provide crucial services both on the front line and behind the news in crisis situations, so let’s celebrate our contributions amongst ourselves as well as provide the general public with information about our work’.

CDT_NEWS_0049	2020-08-28	NEWS	A brand-new after-sales service system for our clients	 As the shared language service provider for the EU agencies and other EU bodies and institutions, the Translation Centre has always paid particular attention to ensuring the high quality of its products and meeting its stakeholders’ requirements. With this aim in mind, since 2001, the Centre has had a free after-sales service in place. This was originally based on the Client Satisfaction Form (CSF) which allowed clients to express their satisfaction and submit feedback on the language services provided by the Centre, including requests for fully revised documents. Following on from that, in 2011, the Centre launched its Client Portal, specifically developed to facilitate operational activities with clients. This is when the CSF was converted into an online form which could be accessed securely by clients’ in-house and national competent authority experts. Since then, an impressive total of 21792 CSFs have been successfully processed by the Centre in close cooperation with its clients. With the introduction of its workflow management system, eCdT, in 2016, which integrates the Client Portal, the Centre began looking at its processes for measuring client satisfaction and handling client feedback. The objective was to optimise the current system taking account of the latest trends in the field of feedback and evaluation services, technological advances and clients’ ideas and observations collected throughout the years. After a detailed review, the Centre decided to embark on a project with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) aimed at developing a new solution which would separate measuring client satisfaction from handling client feedback. As a result of this project, from 28 August 2020 onwards, an enhanced after-sales system, based on the Corrected Version Request (CVR) and fully integrated in eCdT, will become available to both clients and the Centre’s staff, covering the needs of all actors involved in the workflow. The main purpose of the CVR is for clients to ask the Centre to review the feedback submitted by their in-house or national subject matter experts on linguistic output delivered by the Centre, and to provide them with an updated version. Measuring client satisfaction will henceforth primarily take place through regular surveys linked to clients’ operational data to help them assess the service quality offered by the Centre. The new CVR fully embedded in the production workflow and the regular client satisfaction surveys will remain cornerstones of the Centre’s quality assurance system, which aims to provide sustained and reliable high quality over time in line with our clients’ needs and expectations. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/brand-new-after-sales-service-system-our-clients

CDT_NEWS_0051	2021-02-24	NEWS	The Centre’s key achievements in 2020	 Between its establishment in 1994 and the end of 2020, the Centre translated almost 13.4 million pages, both into and from the 24 official EU languages and several other non‑EU languages, covering over 800 language pairs in total. In terms of the translation volume in 2020, almost 335 000 pages were for documents and over 300 000 pages were EU trade marks for the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) based in Alicante. In 2020, for the first time ever, the volume of documents exceeded the volume of trade marks. In addition to the translation, modification, editing and revision of documents, the Centre provided various other language services. Some 1 448 days were spent on terminology work and 49 277 term list entries were translated. The need for video subtitling was reconfirmed, with 11 clients ordering a total of 1 601 minutes of this service. For all  language services, the Centre is committed to on-time delivery, and in 2020 it met its deadlines in 99.7% of cases, with only a 3% renegotiation rate. 2020 was the second and final year of implementation of the Centre’s Transformation Plan, covering four areas (translation technology, human resources, quality and client orientation, and institutional aspects). This aimed to introduce structural changes and put in place an optimised business model based on state-of-the-art translation technologies with added value services for clients. As part of this, a separate programme with the EUIPO covered a number of specific IT projects of strategic importance for both organisations. The article ‘Final sprint towards our transformation’ (December 2020) provides an overview of the implementation of this ambitious parallel programme. On behalf of its interinstitutional partners, the Centre continued to manage the EU database IATE ('InterActive Terminology for Europe') which is the terminology reference not only for language professionals, but also for national experts, policy advisers, public administrations, academics and private sector companies. The technical work in 2020 focused on continuous user support and the implementation of numerous change requests. In total, nine IATE releases were completed in 2020. The Centre signed a cooperation agreement with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) and in 2021 will start offering a specific on-site machine translation solution built in collaboration with the European Commission. This brought the Centre’s client portfolio up to 69 clients by the end of 2020. Throughout 2020, the Centre provided exceptional language support in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. It proactively offered its services to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to facilitate smooth communication between the agency and its experts and the public at large in a wide range of languages. Likewise, the Centre supported the European Medicines Agency (EMA) by translating important information on Covid-19 into all EU languages. In addition, on behalf of the IATE partners, the Centre ran an external communication campaign to raise public awareness of the IATE collections of terms related to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 swiftly created by terminologists from the various EU language services in 2020. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/centres-key-achievements-2020
CDT_NEWS_0052	2020-12-17	NEWS	Final sprint towards our transformation	 The Transformation Plan 2019-2020 covers four areas (translation technology; human resources; quality and client orientation; and institutional aspects) as shown in the picture above. The main aims of the plan were to introduce structural changes, implement state-of-the-art translation technologies, including machine translation, and create new services for clients. The transformation process included a separate programme agreed with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), covering a number of specific IT projects of strategic importance for both organisations. What are the main achievements? As a result of our intense cooperation with the EUIPO, we have: developed new services for our clients, such as transcription based on automatic speech recognition, which was launched in June this year, and we have optimised some of our existing services, such as subtitling, language consultancy and translation. In January 2021, we will start offering new services in the areas of translation and transcription; launched our first mobile application eCdT4me, available both on Google Play Store and Apple App Store, which allows our clients as well as our freelance and in-house translators to stay connected and interact with us on language service requests; enhanced our workflows through the integration of relevant tools, thus yielding efficiency and quality gains for us and our clients: Euramis, eTranslation, the Centre’s own custom machine translation engines in the fields of public health and intellectual property, and IATE are now fully embedded in the Centre’s translation process and workflow management activities. Moreover, a new user-friendly translation feedback interface, based on the Corrected Version Request (CVR) and fully connected to the Centre’s Client Portal and workflow management system eCdT, has replaced the former Client Satisfaction Form (CSF) process; come up with a new annual survey approach to measure client satisfaction, which will be put in place from Q1/2021. This will allow the Centre to better monitor the activity status and satisfaction level for each client and enhance client management. In addition, the Centre invested in other enhancements aimed at facilitating our clients’ work, such as the budgetary forecast functionality now available on the Client Portal, or the web translation module for Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 based websites. We have also established the Workflow Management Section as a single operational contact point for our clients. The Section is now managing all workflow steps, from the receipt of the request to the ‘after-sales’ service, as well as the Client Portal. Moreover, the actions included in our transformation plan have enabled us to gain efficiency in the area of human resource management and to invest in specific training for our staff (e.g. post-editing of machine translation; transcription; optimised subtitling; management of translation memories). At the start of 2021, as part of the implementation of Activity Based Management (ABM), Activity Based Budgeting (ABB) and Activity Based Costing (ABC) at the Centre, we will be using a new system for activity and resource allocation. Finally, over the last two years we have fostered interinstitutional cooperation. It is well worth mentioning here that the progress achieved by the Centre in the field of machine translation and its close cooperation with the Commission’s DG Translation have recently made it possible for us to sign an agreement with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) on a service offer tailored to the Office’s needs. It should also be noted that our eCdT workflow management system has obtained a lot of interest from the EU institutions’ translation services. Likewise, we are regularly sharing our experience in the areas of automatic speech recognition, transcription and subtitling with our institutional partners. Most importantly, however, our transformation has helped us to consolidate the Centre as a modern EU language service provider and has opened up new business opportunities. More than ever, we are happy to see our clients turn to us for our expert advice in response to their specific multilingual needs, be it for website localisation, a review of their multilingual strategy, management of workflows and requests involving Member States, non-EU translations or transcription work. The transformation plan has enabled us to move from a one-size-fits-all language service provider to a service provider with a richer, more diversified offer that responds to clients’ specific needs.       	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/final-sprint-towards-our-transformation

The complexity of the projects in terms of format of the files to be translated, language combinations, deadlines and tools to be used made it an interesting business case for the university. Under the guidance of the Centre’s Translation Support Workflow Administrator and the university’s professor in charge of the postgraduate course, students were asked to organise the jobs among themselves and get them done by the requested deadlines. Students were split into several groups, and each person was responsible for one or more roles in the workflow: project managers, translators and revisers. On the basis of the source material provided by the Centre, the project managers split the jobs according to the resources available at their end, prepared projects with the aid of various CAT tools, used machine translation and made sure to post-edit their work. The project preparation was a huge challenge. Students had to consider the format of the files to be translated, the specific instructions given by the Centre and the deadlines to be respected. During this phase, the Centre was systematically consulted as if it were dealing with a real language service provider and provided answers accordingly. Students provided translations from English into Dutch, German, Greek, Spanish, French, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian and Turkish, and also from Russian into English. In all cases, the texts to be translated were in specialised domains such as “job specialised skills and competences”, “railway” and “banking”. Once the translations had been delivered to the Centre, the project management and translations were evaluated by the Centre’s staff. This exercise proved to be very inspirational for both parties. The Centre could appreciate the specialised skills of students who had not yet entered the real world of work, while the students had the opportunity to become familiar with real-life requests and have first-hand experience of the challenges of the world of translation. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/translation-centre-trains-students-translation-workflow-management
CDT_NEWS_0056	2020-12-18	NEWS	Our best wishes for 2021!	 The Centre has proved to be not only structurally robust but also agile over the recent months of disruptions caused by Covid-19. When the Centre sent the vast majority of its staff to work from home full time in March, our activities were not interrupted in any way and we were able to continue to serve our clients, whilst bringing the transformation plan to a successful conclusion. Thanks to this plan, we have been able to launch new services, optimise our workflows and create new platforms for internal and external collaboration. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to our stakeholders for their cooperation throughout this very atypical year. We wish each and every one of you a relaxing festive period and, above all, a healthy and prosperous 2021. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/our-best-wishes-2021
CDT_NEWS_0057	2020-11-20	NEWS	The European Public Prosecutor's Office becomes the Centre’s 69th client	 Given the confidential nature of the documents to be handled by the EPPO, the Centre and the Office have agreed on a specific on-premise machine translation solution, namely Custom Machine Translation as a Service, which will be available 24/7 to the client. Building on the work undertaken by the European Commission, and the Centre’s own activities in the area of machine translation technology, this service is based on dedicated, secure and customised automatic translation software. In practical terms, the Centre’s service package for the EPPO will include the provision of all necessary resources, including management of the solution, and the periodic linguistic maintenance, quality control and assessment of the translation engines. The signing of this agreement illustrates again that the Centre can offer to its clients, not only traditional services, but also tailor-made services, by combining attentive listening to clients' needs, flexibility to adapt working methods, use of technological advances, and inspiration from its long-standing experience. The Centre looks forward to helping the EPPO effectively carry out its important mission for the benefit of EU citizens.   The EPPO: The EU’s answer to fighting crimes against the EU budget In October 2017, the Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, creating the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO). Since then, the EPPO has been establishing its operational structure at all levels and the Office will be operational in early 2021. The mission of this new and independent EU body is to fight large-scale crime, with powers to investigate and prosecute crimes committed against the EU budget through fraud or corruption. In this way, the EU provides itself with a supranational and cross-border mechanism to protect its financial interests and avoid significant economic damage. The EPPO is located in Luxembourg and, to date, the participating countries are 22 out of the 27 EU Member States: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. In September 2019, the European Parliament and the Council appointed Ms Laura Codruta Kövesi as the first European Chief Prosecutor. In July 2020, the Council appointed the 22 prosecutors representing the Member State participants.   More information on the EPPO is available here and in this video: Image: EPPO video, European Commission 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/european-public-prosecutors-office-becomes-centres-69th-client
CDT_NEWS_0058	2021-03-08	NEWS	Empowering gender equality through words	 Can terminology be a source of empowerment? How can we describe situations or phenomena without the right words? You could argue that if something cannot be named, it might as well not exist. Terminological resources such as the IATE terminology database and EIGE’s Gender Equality Glossary and Thesaurus can help individuals and groups find a voice in multiple languages. One of the great features of IATE, which is managed by the Centre on behalf of the interinstitutional IATE partners, is that you can use filters to retrieve terms under specific domains (see the IATE User’s Handbook). People interested in gender equality can use specific keywords to access all the related terms available in IATE, in up to 24 languages. We recommend trying these keywords: rights and freedoms [LAW]; equal treatment [LAW > rights and freedoms > social rights]; gender equality [LAW > rights and freedoms > social rights]; working conditions [EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS > organisation of work and working conditions]. Around 300 of these IATE entries were prepared by the Centre as part of its collaboration with the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) located in Austria and the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) based in Lithuania, which have been clients of ours for many years. For EIGE, we contributed to the creation of the Gender Equality: Glossary of terms and concepts, published on EIGE’s website in 2018. This glossary covers 410 concepts and was developed for the purpose of fostering a common understanding of gender equality terminology across the EU and promoting gender-fair and inclusive language. The glossary’s concepts were selected from key regulatory and policy documents of the EU institutions, the Council of Europe and the United Nations, as well as from studies, reports and scientific articles. The Centre provided the equivalent terms in all the EU languages. There are several gender equality glossaries available online but many are only monolingual tools. What makes the IATE and EIGE resources exceptional is their multilingual facet, providing broader access to gender-fair and inclusive language for more linguistic communities. This is an outstanding achievement considering the scarcity of such terms in certain languages. Let’s continue in our efforts to create synergies between gender equality, multilingualism and terminology and embrace the new opportunities these might offer. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/empowering-gender-equality-through-words
CDT_NEWS_0059	2020-06-26	NEWS	CdT launches its new transcription service and mobile app	 A principal element in the transformation process is the integration of advanced technologies, such as automatic speech recognition and machine translation, into the Centre’s work processes to extend our service offer for clients. Considerable efforts have also gone into optimising our IT infrastructure and applications, to enhance interaction between all parties – clients, external contractors and in-house staff – involved in the workflow for language service requests. As a result of this investment, we are pleased today to announce the launch of our brand-new Transcription service.  The Centre can now transcribe audio-visual material using state-of-the-art speech-to-text software, combined with post-editing by our professional linguists, to deliver accurate transcriptions of clients’ audio or video files. More information about this service and its benefits is available in the following explanatory video and leaflet. At the same time, we are pleased to announce the availability of our new mobile app eCdT4me, which can be downloaded from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. This app allows clients, contractors, and in-house translators to access services that were previously available only through the Centre’s web portals. With this new app, users can stay connected and interact with the Centre via their mobile phone or tablet, which gives them greater flexibility in organising and following up on their work. More information about our eCdT4me app is available here.  We are convinced that our high-quality Transcription service and mobile app will prove very useful additions for our stakeholders, to support them in meeting their multiple objectives and commitments.     	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/cdt-launches-its-new-transcription-service-and-mobile-app
CDT_NEWS_0060	2020-09-23	NEWS	European Day of Languages 2020	 This initiative dates back to 2001, when the Council organised the European Year of Languages for the first time. At the launch in 2001, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe and the European Commissioner for Education and Culture declared in a joint statement that ‘everybody deserves the chance to benefit from the cultural and economic advantages language skills can bring. Learning languages also helps to develop tolerance and understanding between people from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds’. It is in this spirit that, year after year, events have been organised for the European Day of Languages. This year, due to the COVID-19 crisis, celebrations will be taking place online, and will include the following initiatives: The European Commission will hold an online conference on 28 September from 10:00 until 12:00 (registration required by 24 September at the latest), during which guest speakers will discuss the role of language skills in the context of the European Education Area. They will also analyse how to boost foreign language learning and incorporate language diversity and support literacy in all languages in schools. The European Commission’s Directorate-General for Translation (DGT) is running a campaign on social media throughout the month of September to promote the translation profession. The key messages are that we can find translation all around us, that professional translators can be a means of boosting business, and that translation is a modern, highly developed profession that offers plenty of potential for students and young people. The social media accounts used for this campaign are: facebook.com/TranslatingForEurope, facebook.com/translatores, twitter.com/translatores, instagram.com/translatingforeurope, youtube.com/DGTranslation. On 26 September, the European Parliament is organising its Multilingualism Day, offering virtual workshops (prior registration on a ‘first come, first served’ basis is required) on various topics such as ‘A day in the life of a translator and an interpreter’, ‘How do I become a translator or an interpreter?, ‘Translation traineeships’ and ‘How technology is changing the roles and ways of working of translators and interpreters’. For a bit of fun, have a look at the ‘Secret agent’s handbook of language challenges’ designed by the Council of Europe. It contains 51 challenges that encourage language learners to take risks and any opportunities they have to practise a language they are learning outside the classroom. At the Translation Centre, our main purpose being to respond to the translation and language-related needs of the EU agencies, we are fully behind the celebration of the European Day of Languages. It is an initiative that serves to remind us every year that one of the European Union’s key assets is cultural and linguistic diversity. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/european-day-languages-2020
CDT_NEWS_0061	2020-10-30	NEWS	IATE at the EU Open Data Explained (ODE) webinar on 9 November 2020	 At this session, two highly practical tools available as open data to translators, interpreters or providers of content in multiple languages will be introduced: the EU-specific terminology database IATE (InterActive Terminology for Europe), developed and managed by the Translation Centre on behalf of the IATE partners; and the multilingual Translation Memory Euramis, managed by the Directorate-General for Translation (DGT) of the European Commission and regularly enriched by different EU institutions. IATE will be presented by the Centre’s IATE tool manager, who will speak about features for searching, retrieving and reusing data: Basic and expanded search Results and metadata Advanced search and exports for internal users Possibilities for external users: use of IATE public search APIs and downloading data with a limited set of metada The DGT Terminology Coordination Unit will then present a specific case, namely how the COVID-19 collection was built in IATE. Subsequently, representatives from the DGT’s Informatics Unit will go into the specific features of Euramis. There will be Q&A slots for the attendants. The webinar is open for registration and participation is free of charge.

CDT_NEWS_0062	2020-12-17	NEWS	New services as from January 2021: Automatic Transcription, Automatic Translation, Paste ‘n’ Go	 Combining our know-how with the use of the most advanced and accessible technologies has allowed us to extend the service offer for our clients. From the start of 2021, they will thus be able to benefit from the following three new services: Automatic Transcription, Automatic Translation and Paste ‘n’ Go, the first two resulting from the fruitful cooperation with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO): Automatic transcription complements the transcription service already available since June this year and builds entirely on the reliable speech-to-text technology integrated into our production workflow. This service may be advantageous for clients who need the written text of a recording quickly, but not necessarily with 100% accuracy. Automatic translation represents the first step on our way towards modularising our flagship product ‘Translation’. This service relies on the Centre’s custom machine translation engines in combination with our translation memories. The fully automated processing of incoming requests will result in sufficiently comprehensible translations in a very short time and at a highly attractive price. The Paste ‘n’ Go service has been designed to speed up the process of creating requests and retrieving translations of short, unformatted texts through a dedicated web form on our Client Portal. It will enable clients to reduce costs and turnaround times while obtaining a high-quality translation thanks to a partially automated workflow and the involvement of the Centre’s expert linguists. The Centre’s diversified service offer responds to our clients’ evolving business language needs and is a proof of our commitment to finding innovative solutions for their future challenges.   Link to Transcription leaflet Link to Modularising translation leaflet  	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/new-services-january-2021-automatic-transcription-automatic-translation-paste-n-go
CDT_NEWS_0063	2020-06-15	NEWS	EU terminologists against COVID podcast	 The interview is a very interesting conversation, covering many concrete examples, on how COVID-19 terminology has been developed in IATE, the interinstitutional terminology database of the European Union. Paula Zorrilla-Agut (IATE Tool Manager at CdT) gave a brief overview of the IATE system, its target audience, and how its content and functionalities have evolved. She also gave some details on the management of collections and on the list of COVID-19 terminology that is shared with public users on some EU platforms. Ninetta Kapetanaki (Terminology Coordinator at the Commission’s DGT) and Ingrid Swinnen (Terminology Coordinator at the Council of the EU) explained in detail how the various institutions cooperated with one another on this project, and also discussed their institution-specific needs regarding COVID-19 terminology and how IATE has been enriched with concepts and language equivalents in this domain. They presented different examples of concepts that were not being used consistently in the media and that required very thorough research and documentation in the respective IATE entries, e.g. ‘coronavirus’ versus ‘COVID-19’, ‘outbreak’ versus ‘pandemic’, ‘physical distancing’ versus ‘social distancing’, ‘cross-border worker’ versus ‘frontier worker’. Don’t miss the details, on https://webcast.ec.europa.eu/eu-terminologists-against-covid (webcast) or https://www.podomatic.com/podcasts/dgtradiolingvistika/episodes/2020-05-25T09_13_31-07_00 (podcast)!   More about IATE IATE was made available to the general public in 2007 and receives around 200 000 queries per day from nearly 200 countries. The Translation Centre manages IATE on behalf of the IATE partners, i.e. the European Parliament, the Council, the European Commission, the Court of Justice, the European Central Bank, the European Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the European Committee of the Regions and the European Investment Bank.   More about DGT Academy – Radio Lingvistika Run by the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Translation, Radio Lingvistika holds a series of educational radio conversations on multilingualism and linguistic issues.

For example, over the past few weeks, some countries preferred to use the familiar ‘you’ for their slogans while others chose the polite form. Likewise, some opted for the singular and others the plural. On our website, you will find 25 versions of the poster, with each language in the forefront and the other ones below.

CDT_NEWS_0066	2020-03-23	NEWS	The Centre’s key achievements in 2019	 By the end of 2019, and since its establishment in 1994, the Centre had translated almost 12.8 million pages, both into the 24 official EU languages and from and into various non‑EU languages, amounting to over 700 language combinations in total. Of the total translation volume in 2019, almost 310 000 pages were documents and almost 349 000 pages consisted of EU trade marks for the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) based in Alicante. In addition to translation, modification, editing and revision of documents, the Centre also provided various other language services. Some 1 129 person-days were devoted to terminology work and 41 000 term list entries were translated. The need for video subtitling was once again confirmed: 10 clients ordered a total of 2 571 minutes of this service. For all the language services it provides to clients, the Centre is committed to on-time delivery and it met its deadlines in 99.9% of cases, with only a 4% renegotiation rate. The Transformation Plan 2019-2020 covers four areas (translation technology, human resources, quality and client orientation, and institutional aspects), and it had a good first year as shown in the picture above. The aim of the plan is to introduce structural changes and implement a financially sustainable business model based on translation technologies, including machine translation, and new services for clients. The Centre’s transformation process includes a separate programme agreed with the EUIPO covering a number of specific projects (see the building in the middle of the picture above with project (P) numbers at the bottom of the windows). In 2019, the Centre already achieved several of the defined targets within those projects, such as: the systematic feeding and integration of the Euramis interinstitutional translation memory system; the integration of the IATE interinstitutional terminology database into the translators’ CAT environment; and the option for the Centre’s clients to send their revised translations in bilingual format to update the Centre’s translation memories. The Centre was delighted to sign a cooperation agreement with three new clients in 2019: the European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC); the European Labour Authority (ELA); and the Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW). All of these clients offer promising business opportunities. The Centre’s client portfolio thus consisted of 68 clients by the end of 2019. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/centres-key-achievements-2019
CDT_NEWS_0067	2020-01-30	NEWS	Migration of CuriaTerm into IATE	 Having its terminology in the new IATE database enables the Court to benefit from the latest technology, while establishing closer links with other institutions’ terminology data. Switching tools should not have a significant impact on the Court’s methodology for managing terminology, as it will follow the same principles while adapting to the rules in the IATE Handbook. Some features of the CJEU’s terminology entries will be carried over to IATE, such as the identification of legal systems, notes for concepts without equivalence for languages without terms, descriptions at the concept level, the wide use of semantic relations, and specific legal domains under the domain note. Other IATE partners will also be able to adopt some of the CJEU’s practices, like the use of conceptual trees and the distinction between natural and functional equivalents. The CJEU entries in IATE were created by the lawyer-linguists from the Directorate-General for Multilingualism and the terminologists from the Projects and Terminological Coordination Unit’ of the CJEU. Over the coming months, these entries will be grouped into different collections to enable IATE users to identify the relevant concepts in the context of a specific document or case.   	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/migration-curiaterm-iate
CDT_NEWS_0068	2020-05-04	NEWS	Writing for translation	 Many years ago, the Centre produced two booklets entitled Writing for translation / Écrire pour être traduit. The booklets have been updated regularly and published on the Centre’s website in the main working languages of the Centre, English and French, and they are part of the information package given to all new clients. Both language versions were last updated at the end of 2019 to reflect the impact of technology on drafting documents. They therefore include for the first time a chapter on technical aspects to bear in mind when producing documents for translation (13. Show technical awareness / 12. Faites preuve de sensibilité technique). The Centre invites its in-house authors to use the two booklets and encourages all clients to distribute them among their drafting staff and to consult them regularly. Through these booklets and through the presentation that it organises periodically to raise awareness on the same subject, the Centre seeks to coach authors on best practices in drafting texts intended for translation. The Centre also regularly encourages its clients to submit source texts which are technically well-formatted, a sine qua non for the subsequent pre-processing designed to leverage the content of the Centre’s translation memories. Happy reading and do not hesitate to implement the best practices in the booklets when you next draft a document!     	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/writing-translation

CDT_NEWS_0073	2020-04-30	NEWS	COVID-19 multilingual terminology available in IATE	 Over the past few weeks, terminologists from the different translation services of the EU institutions have redoubled their efforts to enrich the interinstitutional terminology database IATE with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 related concepts. Currently, 270 entries, with 9 020 terms in 24 EU languages, have been compiled on the pandemic (data as of 29/04/2020). The leading entry is, as would be expected, ‘COVID-19’, and it can be found at this address: https://iate.europa.eu/entry/result/3588486/all. To enable IATE users to access these 270 entries in one go, an Excel spreadsheet listing all the terms has been produced (see below). The URLs in the second column point to the relevant multilingual entry in the IATE database, some of which are still being updated by terminologists. Users can search in IATE by ID or term, or click directly on the entry link to have a detailed view of a specific concept with all the available metadata (definitions, notes, contexts, etc.). IATE users now benefit from coverage of the topic in their own languages, and this will continue to grow and develop in parallel with requirements. Users have access to accurate and harmonised multilingual content, which will assist them in their work, often completed under very tight deadlines. The database receives an average of 45 million queries per year, which clearly demonstrates its role as a very popular and useful tool for many people. In these difficult times, everyone is doing their best, within their remit, to deal with the coronavirus crisis. EU terminologists therefore hope that IATE users will find this new collection of terms useful.   Useful links The IATE terminology collection around COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 (Excel spreadsheet) Warning: please note that this Excel file is a screenshot of the pandemic-related content available in IATE taken on 29 April 2020.

CDT_NEWS_0074	2020-05-08	NEWS	Celebrating 70 years since the creation of the European Union	 On 9 May 1950, the French foreign minister Robert Schuman made an appeal for the creation of a European Coal and Steel Community that would bring nations to work together. Some of his words in what is known as the Schuman Declaration still resonate today: ‘World peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it’. In times of crisis such as the one we are currently experiencing, it is important that we ‘stand together’, as the European Commission's president Ms von der Leyen rightly says. We do indeed need to make creative efforts and also think about and recognise the achievements, as well as the added value, that the European Union has brought about. One such achievement is that the EU has united people of different cultural and linguistic backgrounds, which has largely been made possible through the EU's multilingual policy. There are 24 official languages in the Union today, and a great number and variety of texts are regularly translated into all of them, thus giving EU citizens access to important information and facilitating communication. That this can take place is thanks to the various translation services of the EU administration, i.e. the European Parliament, the European Council/the Council of the EU, the European Commission, the Court of Justice, the European Central Bank, the European Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the European Committee of the Regions, the European Investment Bank and the Translation Centre. To celebrate – online this year – both Europe Day and the enormous value of multilingualism together, a video has been produced by the Translation Centre on behalf of the EU translation services. It talks of the beginning of the Union, and the gradual increase in the number of official EU languages in line with successive enlargements. The video illustrates what Robert Schuman said in his declaration: ‘Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity’.

CDT_NEWS_0078	2019-12-18	NEWS	DG GROW becomes the Centre’s 68th client	 DG GROW is the European Commission service responsible for completing the internal market for goods and services. Among its missions is to foster entrepreneurship and growth by reducing the administrative burden on small businesses. DG GROW is therefore currently developing the single digital gateway, which aims to facilitate online access to the information, administrative procedures and assistance that citizens and businesses need to operate in another EU country. The information to be translated will include procedures in the areas of travel, work, retirement, transportation, access to education and youth services, health services, starting a business and financial, environmental, employment and taxation rules. As the information in the 28 EU Member States is usually only available in the national language(s), the Commission has undertaken to fund the translation of around 500 web pages per Member State, by signing an arrangement with the Translation Centre. The plan is for all Member States’ websites to be available in the national language(s) and also another language (currently English only but more might be added in the future). The project is scheduled to run over two years (2020/2021); beyond that, web pages may need to be updated periodically. The Translation Centre is pleased to be able to offer its language services to its third European Commission Directorate-General. It has already been working for the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL) since 2003 on the EURES portal and this year on the European Skills/Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) project, and with the Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (DG JUST) since 2015 on the Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform.

CDT_NEWS_0079	2019-11-12	NEWS	Focus on computational and corpus-based phraseology at Europhras 2019	 The three-day programme featured presentations on a range of interdisciplinary topics. These included corpus-based, psycholinguistic and cognitive approaches to the study of phraseology, the computational treatment of multi-word expressions, as well as their practical applications in translation, lexicography and language learning, teaching and assessment. Four international keynote speakers presented new research on computational phraseology. Miloš Jakubíček, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Lexical Computing and a software developer of SketchEngine, gave a talk on automatic methods for extracting multi-word expressions (MWEs) based on standard properties such as fixedness, and the degree to which a multi-word item is frozen as a sequence of words. Aline Villavicencio, Professor at the Department of Computer Science in the University of Sheffield (United Kingdom), presented an overview of the advances in the identification of MWEs, based on the various degrees of peculiarities they display, including lexical, syntactic, semantic and statistical information. Natalie Kübler, Professor of Specialised Translation and Languages for Specific Purposes at the Paris Diderot University, showed how research and practice have evolved in specialised translation studies due to an increased focus on theoretical corpus-based translation. Ruslan Mitkov, Professor at the University of Wolverhampton (United Kingdom), is a renowned expert in natural language processing and the sole Editor of The Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics (Oxford University Press) and Executive Editor of the Journal of Natural Language Engineering (Cambridge University Press). Professor Mitkov gave an interesting talk on the automatic translation of MWEs using comparable corpora. EUROPHRAS 2019 also hosted the fourth Workshop on Multi-word Units in Machine Translation and Translation Technology (MUMTTT 2019), aimed at bringing together researchers working on Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches based on the computational treatment of multi-word units. At the EUROPHRAS 2019 conference, it became clear to all that phraseological data is available like never before thanks to new corpus-based technology and to new algorithms based on computational techniques to identify MWEs clusters. Corpora will continue to grow in the next years and phraseology studies must benefit from this approach. One of the main challenges for Machine Translation continues to be the recognition of phraseology so as to avoid literal translation from the analysis of compositional expressions in the source text. Therefore it is crucial for linguists and engineers to concentrate their efforts on the study and identification of MWEs to enable their automatic identification in large corpora.

There you will find the calendar of events and fascinating linguistic gems for language aficionados, such as historical language facts, unique ‘untranslatable’ words in each language, tongue-twisters, false friends, palindromes, and many more. As part of the European Day of Languages, the European Parliament will open its doors to the public on Saturday 28 September. Linguists will be on hand to immerse participants in the worlds of translation and interpreting through discussion and Q&A sessions (managing documents in 24 languages, the ins and outs of interpreting, recruitment and life-long learning.) As it does every year, the European Commission has prepared a special poster for the event, this time giving tongue twisters in all the official EU languages. The videos of native and non-native speakers from the Directorate-General for Translation (DGT) and the Directorate‑General for Interpretation (DG SCIC) reading them out will be posted on the ‘Translating for Europe’ Facebook page and Instagram account as well as on Twitter (‘Translatores’) throughout September.

CDT_NEWS_0081	2019-07-18	NEWS	Effectively communicating human rights	 Thierry Fontenelle, head of the Translation Department, welcomed the two guests from Vienna, highlighting that FRA was a long-standing client of the Centre. He explained that the main objective of the seminar was to clarify new key concepts in the area of fundamental rights for the Centre’s translators, as its terminology was evolving rapidly. Dorothee Reinfried firstly presented the brochure on ‘10 keys to effectively communicating human rights’.  The brochure, which the Centre translated into 21 languages, came about as a result of FRA’s discovery that public and political interest in, and support for, human rights was on the wane. They therefore decided to compile a brochure on best practices and started a debate to try to secure help not only from stakeholders and interest groups, but also from other expert groups and influencers, such as epistemologists, cognitive scientists, critical discourse analysts, art experts, satirical cartoonists and media specialists.  In her presentation, Dorothee Reinfried talked about FRA's multilingual communication and publications policy, including its publishing and editing processes and upcoming projects.  Next, Magdalena Bielecka presented FRA's quality assurance processes for translations. Numerous different topics were addressed in collaboration with the Centre’s in-house translators. Dorothee Reinfried then looked at the terminology issues that had been submitted by the Centre in advance, and outlined the Agency’s recommendations and preferences for these. Topics included the terminology in the recent LGBTI survey launched by FRA a few weeks previously. Finally, the group discussed the gendering of language. Generally, the audience was of the opinion that gendering should be applied in such a way as to not compromise the readability of a text. The topic of fundamental rights sparked intense interest among participants. The seminar was expedient for discussing terminology preferences and gaining a better understanding of FRA's activities and priorities, and was highly appreciated by all attendees.     	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/effectively-communicating-human-rights
CDT_NEWS_0082	2019-06-04	NEWS	Translating for High Performance Computing	 European science and industry need access to world-class HPC resources in order to remain innovative and competitive. Currently, EU supercomputers depend on third-country technology and are not among the global top 10. In an effort to address this technology gap, the EU has developed a broad supercomputing infrastructure strategy and has established the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, which will operate initially from 2019 to 2026. The mission of this Joint Undertaking is twofold. Firstly, EuroHPC will launch calls for tenders to acquire computers for the coming exascale era. Exascale computers operate one quintillion calculations per second, i.e. one thousand more than the petascale supercomputers in use today. The new machines will be made available to Europe’s scientific, industrial and public users. Secondly, EuroHPC will support research and innovation activities in order to promote a world-class HPC ecosystem in the EU. The Translation Centre is pleased to include the EuroHPC JU in its portfolio of clients, which now stands at 66 clients specialising in a broad range of fields.

CDT_NEWS_0083	2019-12-09	NEWS	Takeaways from the Translating Europe Forum 2019	 The panel discussions centred on areas where translation plays an invaluable role, such as healthcare, crises and disaster relief, and tourism and entertainment, and speakers from various sectors also shared their recent experiences of translation. Two Directorates-General of the Commission, DG GROW and DG JUST, presented the translation projects for their web platforms, namely the Your Europe information web portal and the Online Dispute Resolution platform (translated by the DGT and the Translation Centre). The Banque Cantonale Vaudoise (BCV) talked about how they have included translators in their communication process. For the target text to be turned into good content, translators need to have the necessary background information and be fully involved in the communication workflow – not just right at the end. In the discussion How public institutions and civil society benefit from translation, Amnesty International described some of the challenges they face in their translation work, such as 80+ formats, non-final versions of documents sent for translation (corrections/updates made to texts during translation) and a lack of key information (e.g. gender, references etc.). Microsoft, which relies heavily on machine translation, said that the technology was very fast reaching human parity. However, in their view, what is still missing compared with true human parity is document context, real-world knowledge and non-zero chance of catastrophic mistakes. During the session New frontiers in language technologies, university researchers explained how they are currently exploring options for automatic meeting summarisation (minuting) and optimisation of real-time continuous transcription for interpreters. In Translation in the entertainment sector, Ubisoft looked at video game localisation, where statistics reveal 2.3 billion gamers globally.  ‘Triple A’ (or AAA) games can be likened to bestseller films, and are now localised in 20 languages and dubbed into nine. Multilingualism also forms the basis of arte, the European culture TV channel, where intensive use is made of subtitling, voice-over and dubbing, and translators working in-house are also journalists. The conference was rounded off by a presentation given by Farid Tabaraki, trend watcher and futurist, who believes that by understanding each other, we create a better society. He stated that ‘change is the only permanence and uncertainty is the only certainty’, and that as a society, we are moving from hierarchy to hubs, process to play, scarcity to abundance, entrepreneurs to intrapreneurs and ego to eco. In our rapidly changing world, the Translating Europe Forum 2019 was a great opportunity to reflect on the role of translation and its impact on society. Translation is indeed all around us, and the good news is that there is a bright future for high-quality professionals in the sector, provided they take stock of the fact that new skills and technologies are an indispensable part of the profession today.

CDT_NEWS_0084	2019-10-18	NEWS	IAMLADP University Contact Group special session in China	 Thierry Fontenelle, the former head of the Translation Department, attended the meeting, where he outlined the activities and the mission of the Translation Centre. He then taught alongside a SISU translation professor for the benefit of a few dozen Chinese translation and interpretation students, with representatives from various universities and from UN, EU, WTO and OECD translation and interpretation services also in attendance. The teaching session proved to be a successful and interesting interactive exercise for all. Thierry Fontenelle also provided a brief overview of the field of terminology for translators and explained the new features of the IATE interinstitutional terminology database, which is managed by the Translation Centre on behalf of the IATE partners. The representatives from international organisations, which included both translators and interpreters, were invited to present the activities of their respective organisations and to reflect upon how universities can adapt their curricula to the new needs and competence profiles of contemporary translators and interpreters in international organisations. The SISU hosts also organised a mock conference on the topic of food safety, which allowed the local Chinese students to provide interpretation in various languages (Chinese, English, French, Spanish and Russian), after which the representatives from international organisations were able to provide the students with useful and constructive feedback on their performance. The third day was devoted to a visit to the Chinese company iFlytek, which specializes in the development of artificial intelligence software and which is recognized as one of the world leaders in the field of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation. iFlytek has more than 12,000 employees and those employees devote impressive financial and human resources to collect masses of speech and textual data in dozens of languages to improve their linguistic technology. They also apply artificial intelligence techniques and neural technologies to different types of fields that go beyond speech recognition and machine translation that cover other domains such as face, image and pattern recognition (e.g. in the medical field). The SISU organisers concluded that the special session of the University Contact Group, which they had organised, marked a crucial milestone in the Translation and Interpretation education in China and highlighted the essential role of the IAMLADP University Contact Group as the linchpin of employers in international organisations and university educators of language professionals. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/iamladp-university-contact-group-special-session-china

CDT_NEWS_0087	2019-07-17	NEWS	2019 IAMLADP Annual Meeting	 IAMLADP is the biggest network of managers of IOs employing conference and language services providers – mainly translators and interpreters. As such, IAMLADP represents a community of about 10,000 language professionals. The United Nations Department for General Assembly and Conference Management in New York is the permanent Chair of the IAMLADP. As in previous years, the Annual Meeting included an Ideas Fair, where participants were able to present ideas, which were then discussed in a plenary session. Ideas included the need to continue investing in neural machine translation technology and promote it as a complement to human translation, which would be in the interest of the language services. Representatives from various international organisations gave presentations on a variety of topics ranging from language technology and machine translation, to inclusive language, to the new skillsets of translators in our digital world. The Council, for instance, presented its Guide for inclusive communication that aims to combat global unconscious biases through inclusive communication. The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) gave a presentation on speech to text activities and its attempt to apply open-source machine learning technology to the creation of a voice recognition and transcription tool for its IP conferences. One of the highlights of the Annual Meeting was indisputably its ‘peer sessions’. In terms of translation management, it focused on topics such as practices in post-editing of machine translation, and the European Commission DGT's Clear Writing campaign to improve the quality of source documents to be translated. One peer session dealt with the need for IOs to redefine the profile of their translators. With new tasks such as editing, subtitling and the production of audio and video material for podcasts, it is important to identify the new skills required and train translators accordingly. Another highlight of the meeting was undoubtedly the discussion around the host paper drafted by the four hosting institutions entitled ‘New technologies and artificial intelligence in the field of language and conference services’. During the discussion, it was very clear that high-quality multilingualism is the raison d’être of the EU translation services. The question today is not whether translation services should embrace and use new technologies, but how they can best do so. It is therefore crucial to strike the right balance between too much and too little enthusiasm regarding the progress made by artificial intelligence and language technology. It is essential that we understand the potential of these new technologies, and are able to harness their power and recognise and accept their limitations. This means humans must remain at the heart of operations if the translation services are to continue to guarantee the quality which clients have come to expect from them.  Useful links ·         IAMLADP website ·         The Host Paper on ‘New technologies and artificial intelligence in the field of language and conference services’   	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/2019-iamladp-annual-meeting
CDT_NEWS_0088	2019-06-03	NEWS	Fifth Translation Contact Network meeting	 In his opening speech, the Centre’s acting Director, Benoît Vitale, stressed that, since the previous meeting in February 2018, the Centre had successfully implemented a series of large IT projects, such as a fully redesigned Client Portal, a web translation module for websites based on Drupal 7, and a brand-new version of the interinstitutional terminology database IATE. He also highlighted the fact that the Centre had laid the foundations for its future development by integrating machine translation (MT) into its production workflow and starting to build customised MT engines in the fields of public health and intellectual property case-law in close cooperation with its partner DG at the European Commission and its clients. He underlined the importance of the results from the external ‘Study on the Translation Centre as the Linguistic Shared Service Provider for the EU Agencies and Bodies’ conducted in 2017/2018, which had enabled the Centre to establish the priorities to work on in the next 2 years.Finally, he pointed out that the volume of documents translated by the Centre had once again reached a record in 2018 (369 000 pages), which was evidence that there was a lot of interest among the Centre’s clients in upholding multilingualism in the EU in order to reach out to citizens. He said that this was particularly important in view of the forthcoming European elections and the constitution of a new European Commission. After the welcome and the introduction of the day’s agenda, the participants briefly introduced themselves and presented their organisation’s priorities in the field of translation for the current year. Several clients emphasised how important it was to receive fast, reliable, accurate and high-quality translations from the Centre. Many explicitly pointed out that they were very happy with the Centre’s services and the assistance from the Centre’s staff. Several clients expressed their satisfaction with the subtitling service provided by the Centre, while others said they were looking forward to using the Centre’s new web translation service. Other topics on the agenda during the morning session included the Centre’s web translation module for websites based on Drupal 7and the implementation of MT in the workflow. The Centre also presented the outcome of the external study as well as its Transformation Plan for 2019/2020. Based on the study recommendations, the plan consists of four pillars: translation technology; quality and client Orientation; human resources and organisation; and interinstitutional cooperation. The afternoon session was opened by a representative from the Business Communications Service (Customer Department) of the European Union Intellectual Property Office, whose presentation raised awareness among participants of the potential of automatic speech recognition. This is one of the future services that the Center is exploring. What would happen if the Centre were not there to deal with all the aspects of translation projects? This question was addressed in a presentation on the importance of the Centre’s revision of freelance translations. Based on specific examples, the presentation highlighted the added value of the different quality assurance and other in house activities which the Centre’s linguists carry out on a daily basis. This led on to a more wide-ranging discussion on the topic of revision. A number of clients revise the translations received from the Centre either with their in-house experts or with a network of national authorities to make sure that the texts meet the needs of their target audiences. Any feedback from the revision is provided to the Centre via the Client Satisfaction Form (CSF) and handled by the Centre’s translators. The meeting participants discussed how this process could be made less time-consuming for all parties involved while ensuring the best possible translation quality for end users. Another discussion followed on how to best approach the modification of existing documents. Originals and translations often undergo changes at the client’s end as a result of the publication process and thus the Centre’s translation memories do not necessarily reflect the latest status of the documents unless the Centre receives and re-aligns the updated versions. The possible future introduction of a stand-alone alignment service should help to solve this problem. The meeting ended with a presentation of the main features of the new version of IATE (Interactive Terminology for Europe) which was launched in December 2018. This year’s Translation Contact Network was once again an excellent opportunity to meet clients in person, including in the more informal setting of a buffet lunch, and to exchange information and best practices with them. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/fifth-translation-contact-network-meeting

CDT_NEWS_0090	2019-07-30	NEWS	JIAMCATT 2019	 Machine translation (MT) was, as would be expected nowadays, the main topic of the conference. Several discussions showed that various MT solutions have been implemented in a number of organisations in the past few years. Many efforts have been made to develop not only statistical machine translation (SMT) but also neural machine translation (NMT). The European Commission’s NMT solution, eTranslation, has been up and running for some time already in many EU institutions and other organisations, covering all EU languages. In the United Nations family, the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) has achieved very good results with ‘WIPO Translate’. Other smaller organisations have also tested and implemented MT solutions in their workflow by relying on market solutions. Jochem Hummel, the keynote speaker of this year’s JIAMCATT, set the tone for the conference with his presentation entitled “Sunsetting of CAT tools”. The discussions focused on various hot topics such as the increased cognitive effort required in post‑editing; the elevation of terminology from a concept-based approach to a knowledge-based approach; the new skills required by those involved in the translation process; the inclusion of experts in the translation workflow; user interface re-thinking; and change management.  Spread over 12 knowledge café working groups, participants from UN and EU bodies, universities and NGOs brainstormed around the main challenges of specific topics, and proposed solutions. Two Centre representatives took part in the working groups on neural machine translation (NMT), which focused on quality, post-editing and its implications, and the future of computer-assisted translation (CAT) and computer-assisted revision (CAR). One of their conclusions was that nowadays practically no translators translate a sentence from scratch without consulting an existing resource such as translation memories, multilingual corpora (internal or publicly available resources), terminology databases (IATE, UNTERM, FAOTERM, etc.) and MT. In terms of training, this means that translators need to learn post‑editing techniques and be aware of the difference between post-editing – when a translator has to edit the output of a machine translation system – and revision – when a translator revises the translation provided by a human translator. JIAMCATT 2019 also provided the Centre with an opportunity to present its current work on speech recognition technologies. The aim is to automate as much as possible the speech-to-text processes to be applied to transcription and/or subtitling services. Today, more than ever, the future is now – and JIAMCATT was there to remind us. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/jiamcatt-2019

CDT_NEWS_0093	2019-06-27	NEWS	European Commission publishes list of EMT-certified translation schools	 The European Master’s in Translation Network, also known as the EMT Network, is a partnership project between the European Commission and universities and higher education institutions offering translation programmes. Its objective is to facilitate the integration of young translation graduates into the labour market. Last year, the EMT network adopted a competency framework for the period 2018-2024. Higher education programmes that have met the professional standards set out in this document have been awarded the EMT mark issued by the European Commission. Five major areas of competence are defined in the EMT framework: language and culture, translation, technology, personal and interpersonal, and service delivery. During EMT-certified Master’s courses, students become aware that the translation profession is multidimensional and involves more than (simply) conveying a message from one language into another. It requires knowing how to deliver a complete translation service. This covers areas as diverse as looking for clients, professional budgeting tips, management of translation workflow, and administration of linguistic and IT resources. Personal and interpersonal skills (commonly referred to as soft skills) such as the ability to work in a team or to meet deadlines are also increasingly being taught and evaluated. Some of the skills referred to in this reference document illustrate that the translation market has evolved very rapidly. For example, future graduates are now required to know how to post-edit machine translation (MT) output, to be able to assess the relevance of MT systems in a translation workflow, or to know how to use social media responsibly for business purposes. More than at any time previously, the translators of tomorrow will be at a crossroads!   Find out more • List of members of the EMT Network 2019-2024• EMT Network Competency Framework• EMT Network Facebook page 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/european-commission-publishes-list-emt-certified-translation-schools
CDT_NEWS_0094	2019-04-10	NEWS	Training for our Hungarian translators in the public health field	 After a presentation of the Translation Centre’s translation workflow and quality assurance model, the two OGYÉI representatives took the floor to describe the structure and operations of the Department for Quality Review of Documents in which they work. They had originally taken the initiative of designing a training course for Hungarian translators working in the field of public health because experience had demonstrated a need to establish translation standards to increase the quality of documents. They firstly gave the training to their colleagues, who work with the product information material translated by either the Centre or the pharmaceutical industry, depending on which regulatory procedure applies. To improve the accessibility of the information, the representatives draw up strict guidelines and internal manuals, which are downloadable from a central database. The next obvious step for the two OGYÉI experts was to extend their training to other interested parties. Around 100 freelance translators and regulatory affairs specialists from the medical-pharmaceutical industry have now attended the course, which consists of two levels (beginners and advanced). The excellent feedback that the pair have received from all parties has confirmed the real need for this structured training. The Centre was therefore delighted to also be able to benefit from OGYÉI’s expertise. Rich and varied course contentThe two-day workshop held at the Centre covered general translation issues and various approaches in translation theory. Some parts of the workshop involved practical sessions where participants tackled problems identified in sample translations, such as word order, problems with the source text/content, grammatical issues, abbreviations, scientific nouns, pharmaceutical expressions, statistics, and terms related to the body’s different biological systems. The participants also discussed various specifics of Hungarian medical translation, including literal translation, compulsory and optional conversion tools in the translator’s toolkit, antonymic translation, syntax errors, text reduction, the correct use of hyphens and dashes and the use of singular versus plural. Valuable information to share with our external language service providersBased on what they learnt in the course, our Hungarian in-house translators have now drafted guidelines and created a term list, which will be integrated as a termbase into the Centre’s CAT tool.

CDT_NEWS_0098	2019-06-03	NEWS	Fifth Translation Contact Network meeting	 In his opening speech, the Centre’s acting Director, Benoît Vitale, stressed that, since the previous meeting in February 2018, the Centre had successfully implemented a series of large IT projects, such as a fully redesigned Client Portal, a web translation module for websites based on Drupal 7, and a brand-new version of the interinstitutional terminology database IATE. He also highlighted the fact that the Centre had laid the foundations for its future development by integrating machine translation (MT) into its production workflow and starting to build customised MT engines in the fields of public health and intellectual property case-law in close cooperation with its partner DG at the European Commission and its clients. He underlined the importance of the results from the external ‘Study on the Translation Centre as the Linguistic Shared Service Provider for the EU Agencies and Bodies’ conducted in 2017/2018, which had enabled the Centre to establish the priorities to work on in the next 2 years.Finally, he pointed out that the volume of documents translated by the Centre had once again reached a record in 2018 (369 000 pages), which was evidence that there was a lot of interest among the Centre’s clients in upholding multilingualism in the EU in order to reach out to citizens. He said that this was particularly important in view of the forthcoming European elections and the constitution of a new European Commission. After the welcome and the introduction of the day’s agenda, the participants briefly introduced themselves and presented their organisation’s priorities in the field of translation for the current year. Several clients emphasised how important it was to receive fast, reliable, accurate and high-quality translations from the Centre. Many explicitly pointed out that they were very happy with the Centre’s services and the assistance from the Centre’s staff. Several clients expressed their satisfaction with the subtitling service provided by the Centre, while others said they were looking forward to using the Centre’s new web translation service. Other topics on the agenda during the morning session included the Centre’s web translation module for websites based on Drupal 7and the implementation of MT in the workflow. The Centre also presented the outcome of the external study as well as its Transformation Plan for 2019/2020. Based on the study recommendations, the plan consists of four pillars: translation technology; quality and client Orientation; human resources and organisation; and interinstitutional cooperation. The afternoon session was opened by a representative from the Business Communications Service (Customer Department) of the European Union Intellectual Property Office, whose presentation raised awareness among participants of the potential of automatic speech recognition. This is one of the future services that the Center is exploring. What would happen if the Centre were not there to deal with all the aspects of translation projects? This question was addressed in a presentation on the importance of the Centre’s revision of freelance translations. Based on specific examples, the presentation highlighted the added value of the different quality assurance and other in house activities which the Centre’s linguists carry out on a daily basis. This led on to a more wide-ranging discussion on the topic of revision. A number of clients revise the translations received from the Centre either with their in-house experts or with a network of national authorities to make sure that the texts meet the needs of their target audiences. Any feedback from the revision is provided to the Centre via the Client Satisfaction Form (CSF) and handled by the Centre’s translators. The meeting participants discussed how this process could be made less time-consuming for all parties involved while ensuring the best possible translation quality for end users. Another discussion followed on how to best approach the modification of existing documents. Originals and translations often undergo changes at the client’s end as a result of the publication process and thus the Centre’s translation memories do not necessarily reflect the latest status of the documents unless the Centre receives and re-aligns the updated versions. The possible future introduction of a stand-alone alignment service should help to solve this problem. The meeting ended with a presentation of the main features of the new version of IATE (Interactive Terminology for Europe) which was launched in December 2018. This year’s Translation Contact Network was once again an excellent opportunity to meet clients in person, including in the more informal setting of a buffet lunch, and to exchange information and best practices with them. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/fifth-translation-contact-network-meeting

Currently, EU supercomputers depend on third-country technology and are not among the global top 10. In an effort to address this technology gap, the EU has developed a broad supercomputing infrastructure strategy and has established the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, which will operate initially from 2019 to 2026. The mission of this Joint Undertaking is twofold. Firstly, EuroHPC will launch calls for tenders to acquire computers for the coming exascale era. Exascale computers operate one quintillion calculations per second, i.e. one thousand more than the petascale supercomputers in use today. The new machines will be made available to Europe’s scientific, industrial and public users. Secondly, EuroHPC will support research and innovation activities in order to promote a world-class HPC ecosystem in the EU. The Translation Centre is pleased to include the EuroHPC JU in its portfolio of clients, which now stands at 66 clients specialising in a broad range of fields.

CDT_NEWS_0101	2019-07-30	NEWS	JIAMCATT 2019	 Machine translation (MT) was, as would be expected nowadays, the main topic of the conference. Several discussions showed that various MT solutions have been implemented in a number of organisations in the past few years. Many efforts have been made to develop not only statistical machine translation (SMT) but also neural machine translation (NMT). The European Commission’s NMT solution, eTranslation, has been up and running for some time already in many EU institutions and other organisations, covering all EU languages. In the United Nations family, the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) has achieved very good results with ‘WIPO Translate’. Other smaller organisations have also tested and implemented MT solutions in their workflow by relying on market solutions. Jochem Hummel, the keynote speaker of this year’s JIAMCATT, set the tone for the conference with his presentation entitled “Sunsetting of CAT tools”. The discussions focused on various hot topics such as the increased cognitive effort required in post‑editing; the elevation of terminology from a concept-based approach to a knowledge-based approach; the new skills required by those involved in the translation process; the inclusion of experts in the translation workflow; user interface re-thinking; and change management.  Spread over 12 knowledge café working groups, participants from UN and EU bodies, universities and NGOs brainstormed around the main challenges of specific topics, and proposed solutions. Two Centre representatives took part in the working groups on neural machine translation (NMT), which focused on quality, post-editing and its implications, and the future of computer-assisted translation (CAT) and computer-assisted revision (CAR). One of their conclusions was that nowadays practically no translators translate a sentence from scratch without consulting an existing resource such as translation memories, multilingual corpora (internal or publicly available resources), terminology databases (IATE, UNTERM, FAOTERM, etc.) and MT. In terms of training, this means that translators need to learn post‑editing techniques and be aware of the difference between post-editing – when a translator has to edit the output of a machine translation system – and revision – when a translator revises the translation provided by a human translator. JIAMCATT 2019 also provided the Centre with an opportunity to present its current work on speech recognition technologies. The aim is to automate as much as possible the speech-to-text processes to be applied to transcription and/or subtitling services. Today, more than ever, the future is now – and JIAMCATT was there to remind us. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/jiamcatt-2019
CDT_NEWS_0102	2019-07-17	NEWS	2019 IAMLADP Annual Meeting	 IAMLADP is the biggest network of managers of IOs employing conference and language services providers – mainly translators and interpreters. As such, IAMLADP represents a community of about 10,000 language professionals. The United Nations Department for General Assembly and Conference Management in New York is the permanent Chair of the IAMLADP. As in previous years, the Annual Meeting included an Ideas Fair, where participants were able to present ideas, which were then discussed in a plenary session. Ideas included the need to continue investing in neural machine translation technology and promote it as a complement to human translation, which would be in the interest of the language services. Representatives from various international organisations gave presentations on a variety of topics ranging from language technology and machine translation, to inclusive language, to the new skillsets of translators in our digital world. The Council, for instance, presented its Guide for inclusive communication that aims to combat global unconscious biases through inclusive communication. The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) gave a presentation on speech to text activities and its attempt to apply open-source machine learning technology to the creation of a voice recognition and transcription tool for its IP conferences. One of the highlights of the Annual Meeting was indisputably its ‘peer sessions’. In terms of translation management, it focused on topics such as practices in post-editing of machine translation, and the European Commission DGT's Clear Writing campaign to improve the quality of source documents to be translated. One peer session dealt with the need for IOs to redefine the profile of their translators. With new tasks such as editing, subtitling and the production of audio and video material for podcasts, it is important to identify the new skills required and train translators accordingly. Another highlight of the meeting was undoubtedly the discussion around the host paper drafted by the four hosting institutions entitled ‘New technologies and artificial intelligence in the field of language and conference services’. During the discussion, it was very clear that high-quality multilingualism is the raison d’être of the EU translation services. The question today is not whether translation services should embrace and use new technologies, but how they can best do so. It is therefore crucial to strike the right balance between too much and too little enthusiasm regarding the progress made by artificial intelligence and language technology. It is essential that we understand the potential of these new technologies, and are able to harness their power and recognise and accept their limitations. This means humans must remain at the heart of operations if the translation services are to continue to guarantee the quality which clients have come to expect from them.  Useful links ·         IAMLADP website ·         The Host Paper on ‘New technologies and artificial intelligence in the field of language and conference services’   	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/2019-iamladp-annual-meeting
CDT_NEWS_0103	2019-07-18	NEWS	Effectively communicating human rights	 Thierry Fontenelle, head of the Translation Department, welcomed the two guests from Vienna, highlighting that FRA was a long-standing client of the Centre. He explained that the main objective of the seminar was to clarify new key concepts in the area of fundamental rights for the Centre’s translators, as its terminology was evolving rapidly. Dorothee Reinfried firstly presented the brochure on ‘10 keys to effectively communicating human rights’.  The brochure, which the Centre translated into 21 languages, came about as a result of FRA’s discovery that public and political interest in, and support for, human rights was on the wane. They therefore decided to compile a brochure on best practices and started a debate to try to secure help not only from stakeholders and interest groups, but also from other expert groups and influencers, such as epistemologists, cognitive scientists, critical discourse analysts, art experts, satirical cartoonists and media specialists.  In her presentation, Dorothee Reinfried talked about FRA's multilingual communication and publications policy, including its publishing and editing processes and upcoming projects.  Next, Magdalena Bielecka presented FRA's quality assurance processes for translations. Numerous different topics were addressed in collaboration with the Centre’s in-house translators. Dorothee Reinfried then looked at the terminology issues that had been submitted by the Centre in advance, and outlined the Agency’s recommendations and preferences for these. Topics included the terminology in the recent LGBTI survey launched by FRA a few weeks previously. Finally, the group discussed the gendering of language. Generally, the audience was of the opinion that gendering should be applied in such a way as to not compromise the readability of a text. The topic of fundamental rights sparked intense interest among participants. The seminar was expedient for discussing terminology preferences and gaining a better understanding of FRA's activities and priorities, and was highly appreciated by all attendees.     	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/effectively-communicating-human-rights

He then taught alongside a SISU translation professor for the benefit of a few dozen Chinese translation and interpretation students, with representatives from various universities and from UN, EU, WTO and OECD translation and interpretation services also in attendance. The teaching session proved to be a successful and interesting interactive exercise for all. Thierry Fontenelle also provided a brief overview of the field of terminology for translators and explained the new features of the IATE interinstitutional terminology database, which is managed by the Translation Centre on behalf of the IATE partners. The representatives from international organisations, which included both translators and interpreters, were invited to present the activities of their respective organisations and to reflect upon how universities can adapt their curricula to the new needs and competence profiles of contemporary translators and interpreters in international organisations. The SISU hosts also organised a mock conference on the topic of food safety, which allowed the local Chinese students to provide interpretation in various languages (Chinese, English, French, Spanish and Russian), after which the representatives from international organisations were able to provide the students with useful and constructive feedback on their performance. The third day was devoted to a visit to the Chinese company iFlytek, which specializes in the development of artificial intelligence software and which is recognized as one of the world leaders in the field of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation. iFlytek has more than 12,000 employees and those employees devote impressive financial and human resources to collect masses of speech and textual data in dozens of languages to improve their linguistic technology. They also apply artificial intelligence techniques and neural technologies to different types of fields that go beyond speech recognition and machine translation that cover other domains such as face, image and pattern recognition (e.g. in the medical field). The SISU organisers concluded that the special session of the University Contact Group, which they had organised, marked a crucial milestone in the Translation and Interpretation education in China and highlighted the essential role of the IAMLADP University Contact Group as the linchpin of employers in international organisations and university educators of language professionals. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/iamladp-university-contact-group-special-session-china
CDT_NEWS_0108	2019-11-12	NEWS	Focus on computational and corpus-based phraseology at Europhras 2019	 The three-day programme featured presentations on a range of interdisciplinary topics. These included corpus-based, psycholinguistic and cognitive approaches to the study of phraseology, the computational treatment of multi-word expressions, as well as their practical applications in translation, lexicography and language learning, teaching and assessment. Four international keynote speakers presented new research on computational phraseology. Miloš Jakubíček, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Lexical Computing and a software developer of SketchEngine, gave a talk on automatic methods for extracting multi-word expressions (MWEs) based on standard properties such as fixedness, and the degree to which a multi-word item is frozen as a sequence of words. Aline Villavicencio, Professor at the Department of Computer Science in the University of Sheffield (United Kingdom), presented an overview of the advances in the identification of MWEs, based on the various degrees of peculiarities they display, including lexical, syntactic, semantic and statistical information. Natalie Kübler, Professor of Specialised Translation and Languages for Specific Purposes at the Paris Diderot University, showed how research and practice have evolved in specialised translation studies due to an increased focus on theoretical corpus-based translation. Ruslan Mitkov, Professor at the University of Wolverhampton (United Kingdom), is a renowned expert in natural language processing and the sole Editor of The Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics (Oxford University Press) and Executive Editor of the Journal of Natural Language Engineering (Cambridge University Press). Professor Mitkov gave an interesting talk on the automatic translation of MWEs using comparable corpora. EUROPHRAS 2019 also hosted the fourth Workshop on Multi-word Units in Machine Translation and Translation Technology (MUMTTT 2019), aimed at bringing together researchers working on Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches based on the computational treatment of multi-word units. At the EUROPHRAS 2019 conference, it became clear to all that phraseological data is available like never before thanks to new corpus-based technology and to new algorithms based on computational techniques to identify MWEs clusters. Corpora will continue to grow in the next years and phraseology studies must benefit from this approach. One of the main challenges for Machine Translation continues to be the recognition of phraseology so as to avoid literal translation from the analysis of compositional expressions in the source text. Therefore it is crucial for linguists and engineers to concentrate their efforts on the study and identification of MWEs to enable their automatic identification in large corpora.

CDT_NEWS_0111	2019-12-09	NEWS	Takeaways from the Translating Europe Forum 2019	 The panel discussions centred on areas where translation plays an invaluable role, such as healthcare, crises and disaster relief, and tourism and entertainment, and speakers from various sectors also shared their recent experiences of translation. Two Directorates-General of the Commission, DG GROW and DG JUST, presented the translation projects for their web platforms, namely the Your Europe information web portal and the Online Dispute Resolution platform (translated by the DGT and the Translation Centre). The Banque Cantonale Vaudoise (BCV) talked about how they have included translators in their communication process. For the target text to be turned into good content, translators need to have the necessary background information and be fully involved in the communication workflow – not just right at the end. In the discussion How public institutions and civil society benefit from translation, Amnesty International described some of the challenges they face in their translation work, such as 80+ formats, non-final versions of documents sent for translation (corrections/updates made to texts during translation) and a lack of key information (e.g. gender, references etc.). Microsoft, which relies heavily on machine translation, said that the technology was very fast reaching human parity. However, in their view, what is still missing compared with true human parity is document context, real-world knowledge and non-zero chance of catastrophic mistakes. During the session New frontiers in language technologies, university researchers explained how they are currently exploring options for automatic meeting summarisation (minuting) and optimisation of real-time continuous transcription for interpreters. In Translation in the entertainment sector, Ubisoft looked at video game localisation, where statistics reveal 2.3 billion gamers globally.  ‘Triple A’ (or AAA) games can be likened to bestseller films, and are now localised in 20 languages and dubbed into nine. Multilingualism also forms the basis of arte, the European culture TV channel, where intensive use is made of subtitling, voice-over and dubbing, and translators working in-house are also journalists. The conference was rounded off by a presentation given by Farid Tabaraki, trend watcher and futurist, who believes that by understanding each other, we create a better society. He stated that ‘change is the only permanence and uncertainty is the only certainty’, and that as a society, we are moving from hierarchy to hubs, process to play, scarcity to abundance, entrepreneurs to intrapreneurs and ego to eco. In our rapidly changing world, the Translating Europe Forum 2019 was a great opportunity to reflect on the role of translation and its impact on society. Translation is indeed all around us, and the good news is that there is a bright future for high-quality professionals in the sector, provided they take stock of the fact that new skills and technologies are an indispensable part of the profession today.

CDT_NEWS_0112	2019-12-18	NEWS	DG GROW becomes the Centre’s 68th client	 DG GROW is the European Commission service responsible for completing the internal market for goods and services. Among its missions is to foster entrepreneurship and growth by reducing the administrative burden on small businesses. DG GROW is therefore currently developing the single digital gateway, which aims to facilitate online access to the information, administrative procedures and assistance that citizens and businesses need to operate in another EU country. The information to be translated will include procedures in the areas of travel, work, retirement, transportation, access to education and youth services, health services, starting a business and financial, environmental, employment and taxation rules. As the information in the 28 EU Member States is usually only available in the national language(s), the Commission has undertaken to fund the translation of around 500 web pages per Member State, by signing an arrangement with the Translation Centre. The plan is for all Member States’ websites to be available in the national language(s) and also another language (currently English only but more might be added in the future). The project is scheduled to run over two years (2020/2021); beyond that, web pages may need to be updated periodically. The Translation Centre is pleased to be able to offer its language services to its third European Commission Directorate-General. It has already been working for the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (DG EMPL) since 2003 on the EURES portal and this year on the European Skills/Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) project, and with the Directorate-General for Justice and Consumers (DG JUST) since 2015 on the Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform.

Switching tools should not have a significant impact on the Court’s methodology for managing terminology, as it will follow the same principles while adapting to the rules in the IATE Handbook. Some features of the CJEU’s terminology entries will be carried over to IATE, such as the identification of legal systems, notes for concepts without equivalence for languages without terms, descriptions at the concept level, the wide use of semantic relations, and specific legal domains under the domain note. Other IATE partners will also be able to adopt some of the CJEU’s practices, like the use of conceptual trees and the distinction between natural and functional equivalents. The CJEU entries in IATE were created by the lawyer-linguists from the Directorate-General for Multilingualism and the terminologists from the Projects and Terminological Coordination Unit’ of the CJEU. Over the coming months, these entries will be grouped into different collections to enable IATE users to identify the relevant concepts in the context of a specific document or case.   	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/migration-curiaterm-iate

CDT_NEWS_0117	2020-03-23	NEWS	The Centre’s key achievements in 2019	 By the end of 2019, and since its establishment in 1994, the Centre had translated almost 12.8 million pages, both into the 24 official EU languages and from and into various non‑EU languages, amounting to over 700 language combinations in total. Of the total translation volume in 2019, almost 310 000 pages were documents and almost 349 000 pages consisted of EU trade marks for the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) based in Alicante. In addition to translation, modification, editing and revision of documents, the Centre also provided various other language services. Some 1 129 person-days were devoted to terminology work and 41 000 term list entries were translated. The need for video subtitling was once again confirmed: 10 clients ordered a total of 2 571 minutes of this service. For all the language services it provides to clients, the Centre is committed to on-time delivery and it met its deadlines in 99.9% of cases, with only a 4% renegotiation rate. The Transformation Plan 2019-2020 covers four areas (translation technology, human resources, quality and client orientation, and institutional aspects), and it had a good first year as shown in the picture above. The aim of the plan is to introduce structural changes and implement a financially sustainable business model based on translation technologies, including machine translation, and new services for clients. The Centre’s transformation process includes a separate programme agreed with the EUIPO covering a number of specific projects (see the building in the middle of the picture above with project (P) numbers at the bottom of the windows). In 2019, the Centre already achieved several of the defined targets within those projects, such as: the systematic feeding and integration of the Euramis interinstitutional translation memory system; the integration of the IATE interinstitutional terminology database into the translators’ CAT environment; and the option for the Centre’s clients to send their revised translations in bilingual format to update the Centre’s translation memories. The Centre was delighted to sign a cooperation agreement with three new clients in 2019: the European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC); the European Labour Authority (ELA); and the Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW). All of these clients offer promising business opportunities. The Centre’s client portfolio thus consisted of 68 clients by the end of 2019. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/centres-key-achievements-2019

CDT_NEWS_0121	2020-04-30	NEWS	COVID-19 multilingual terminology available in IATE	 Over the past few weeks, terminologists from the different translation services of the EU institutions have redoubled their efforts to enrich the interinstitutional terminology database IATE with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 related concepts. Currently, 270 entries, with 9 020 terms in 24 EU languages, have been compiled on the pandemic (data as of 29/04/2020). The leading entry is, as would be expected, ‘COVID-19’, and it can be found at this address: https://iate.europa.eu/entry/result/3588486/all. To enable IATE users to access these 270 entries in one go, an Excel spreadsheet listing all the terms has been produced (see below). The URLs in the second column point to the relevant multilingual entry in the IATE database, some of which are still being updated by terminologists. Users can search in IATE by ID or term, or click directly on the entry link to have a detailed view of a specific concept with all the available metadata (definitions, notes, contexts, etc.). IATE users now benefit from coverage of the topic in their own languages, and this will continue to grow and develop in parallel with requirements. Users have access to accurate and harmonised multilingual content, which will assist them in their work, often completed under very tight deadlines. The database receives an average of 45 million queries per year, which clearly demonstrates its role as a very popular and useful tool for many people. In these difficult times, everyone is doing their best, within their remit, to deal with the coronavirus crisis. EU terminologists therefore hope that IATE users will find this new collection of terms useful.   Useful links The IATE terminology collection around COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 (Excel spreadsheet) Warning: please note that this Excel file is a screenshot of the pandemic-related content available in IATE taken on 29 April 2020.

CDT_NEWS_0122	2020-05-04	NEWS	Writing for translation	 Many years ago, the Centre produced two booklets entitled Writing for translation / Écrire pour être traduit. The booklets have been updated regularly and published on the Centre’s website in the main working languages of the Centre, English and French, and they are part of the information package given to all new clients. Both language versions were last updated at the end of 2019 to reflect the impact of technology on drafting documents. They therefore include for the first time a chapter on technical aspects to bear in mind when producing documents for translation (13. Show technical awareness / 12. Faites preuve de sensibilité technique). The Centre invites its in-house authors to use the two booklets and encourages all clients to distribute them among their drafting staff and to consult them regularly. Through these booklets and through the presentation that it organises periodically to raise awareness on the same subject, the Centre seeks to coach authors on best practices in drafting texts intended for translation. The Centre also regularly encourages its clients to submit source texts which are technically well-formatted, a sine qua non for the subsequent pre-processing designed to leverage the content of the Centre’s translation memories.

CDT_NEWS_0123	2020-05-08	NEWS	Celebrating 70 years since the creation of the European Union	 On 9 May 1950, the French foreign minister Robert Schuman made an appeal for the creation of a European Coal and Steel Community that would bring nations to work together. Some of his words in what is known as the Schuman Declaration still resonate today: ‘World peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it’. In times of crisis such as the one we are currently experiencing, it is important that we ‘stand together’, as the European Commission's president Ms von der Leyen rightly says. We do indeed need to make creative efforts and also think about and recognise the achievements, as well as the added value, that the European Union has brought about. One such achievement is that the EU has united people of different cultural and linguistic backgrounds, which has largely been made possible through the EU's multilingual policy. There are 24 official languages in the Union today, and a great number and variety of texts are regularly translated into all of them, thus giving EU citizens access to important information and facilitating communication. That this can take place is thanks to the various translation services of the EU administration, i.e. the European Parliament, the European Council/the Council of the EU, the European Commission, the Court of Justice, the European Central Bank, the European Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the European Committee of the Regions, the European Investment Bank and the Translation Centre. To celebrate – online this year – both Europe Day and the enormous value of multilingualism together, a video has been produced by the Translation Centre on behalf of the EU translation services. It talks of the beginning of the Union, and the gradual increase in the number of official EU languages in line with successive enlargements. The video illustrates what Robert Schuman said in his declaration: ‘Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity’. Link to the video: https://youtu.be/IUUo7LcMOMw This video has also been made available on the platform launched by the European Commission's Representation in Luxembourg to mark this year's Europe Day.

Paula Zorrilla-Agut (IATE Tool Manager at CdT) gave a brief overview of the IATE system, its target audience, and how its content and functionalities have evolved. She also gave some details on the management of collections and on the list of COVID-19 terminology that is shared with public users on some EU platforms. Ninetta Kapetanaki (Terminology Coordinator at the Commission’s DGT) and Ingrid Swinnen (Terminology Coordinator at the Council of the EU) explained in detail how the various institutions cooperated with one another on this project, and also discussed their institution-specific needs regarding COVID-19 terminology and how IATE has been enriched with concepts and language equivalents in this domain. They presented different examples of concepts that were not being used consistently in the media and that required very thorough research and documentation in the respective IATE entries, e.g. ‘coronavirus’ versus ‘COVID-19’, ‘outbreak’ versus ‘pandemic’, ‘physical distancing’ versus ‘social distancing’, ‘cross-border worker’ versus ‘frontier worker’.

CDT_NEWS_0128	2020-08-26	NEWS	The Translation Centre trains students on translation workflow management	 In the framework of this collaboration, a group of Postgraduate, Master’s and BA students following the course on specialised translation at KU Leuven had the opportunity to work on real-life translation requests handled by the Centre. The complexity of the projects in terms of format of the files to be translated, language combinations, deadlines and tools to be used made it an interesting business case for the university. Under the guidance of the Centre’s Translation Support Workflow Administrator and the university’s professor in charge of the postgraduate course, students were asked to organise the jobs among themselves and get them done by the requested deadlines. Students were split into several groups, and each person was responsible for one or more roles in the workflow: project managers, translators and revisers. On the basis of the source material provided by the Centre, the project managers split the jobs according to the resources available at their end, prepared projects with the aid of various CAT tools, used machine translation and made sure to post-edit their work. The project preparation was a huge challenge. Students had to consider the format of the files to be translated, the specific instructions given by the Centre and the deadlines to be respected. During this phase, the Centre was systematically consulted as if it were dealing with a real language service provider and provided answers accordingly. Students provided translations from English into Dutch, German, Greek, Spanish, French, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian and Turkish, and also from Russian into English. In all cases, the texts to be translated were in specialised domains such as “job specialised skills and competences”, “railway” and “banking”. Once the translations had been delivered to the Centre, the project management and translations were evaluated by the Centre’s staff. This exercise proved to be very inspirational for both parties. The Centre could appreciate the specialised skills of students who had not yet entered the real world of work, while the students had the opportunity to become familiar with real-life requests and have first-hand experience of the challenges of the world of translation. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/translation-centre-trains-students-translation-workflow-management

This was originally based on the Client Satisfaction Form (CSF) which allowed clients to express their satisfaction and submit feedback on the language services provided by the Centre, including requests for fully revised documents. Following on from that, in 2011, the Centre launched its Client Portal, specifically developed to facilitate operational activities with clients. This is when the CSF was converted into an online form which could be accessed securely by clients’ in-house and national competent authority experts. Since then, an impressive total of 21792 CSFs have been successfully processed by the Centre in close cooperation with its clients. With the introduction of its workflow management system, eCdT, in 2016, which integrates the Client Portal, the Centre began looking at its processes for measuring client satisfaction and handling client feedback. The objective was to optimise the current system taking account of the latest trends in the field of feedback and evaluation services, technological advances and clients’ ideas and observations collected throughout the years. After a detailed review, the Centre decided to embark on a project with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) aimed at developing a new solution which would separate measuring client satisfaction from handling client feedback. As a result of this project, from 28 August 2020 onwards, an enhanced after-sales system, based on the Corrected Version Request (CVR) and fully integrated in eCdT, will become available to both clients and the Centre’s staff, covering the needs of all actors involved in the workflow. The main purpose of the CVR is for clients to ask the Centre to review the feedback submitted by their in-house or national subject matter experts on linguistic output delivered by the Centre, and to provide them with an updated version. Measuring client satisfaction will henceforth primarily take place through regular surveys linked to clients’ operational data to help them assess the service quality offered by the Centre. The new CVR fully embedded in the production workflow and the regular client satisfaction surveys will remain cornerstones of the Centre’s quality assurance system, which aims to provide sustained and reliable high quality over time in line with our clients’ needs and expectations. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/brand-new-after-sales-service-system-our-clients
CDT_NEWS_0130	2020-09-30	NEWS	Finding the words for a world in crisis	 This year, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, FIT pays a well-deserved tribute to translators, terminologists and interpreters on its website: ‘Our profession has been pivoting rapidly to keep up with changing realities and expectations, and the importance of our work to ensuring clear information reaches everyone and overcoming language barriers – both global and local – has been highlighted in unprecedented ways this year. Translators, terminologists and interpreters provide crucial services both on the front line and behind the news in crisis situations, so let’s celebrate our contributions amongst ourselves as well as provide the general public with information about our work’. We, at the Translation Centre, share the FIT’s fine sentiments and would like to use the opportunity of International Translation Day to thank our 24 in-house language teams and our huge network of external language service providers for their extraordinary efforts in these difficult times.

CDT_NEWS_0131	2020-09-29	NEWS	Language consultancy – what’s behind this service?	 As we wish to offer not just linguistic assistance but also to cover all the potential communication needs of our clients, we have fully reviewed and adapted the Language Consultancy service, considering both our linguistic competencies and the strong technical skills of our teams. As part of the Language Consultancy service, the Centre can propose the creation and maintenance of customised neural machine translation engines. To make it easier for our clients to interact with their stakeholders, we can also set up and design specific workflow systems. Bearing in mind that one of our main objectives is that the final product is accurate, we are able to provide technical and linguistic pre-editing of the original material to improve its final quality and processing. You will discover this and more in the leaflet that you can consult on our website. From our side, we will continue to analyse our clients’ specific multilingual communication projects in order to provide them with our help, guidance and expertise, and to achieve the best possible solution together. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/language-consultancy-whats-behind-service
CDT_NEWS_0132	2020-09-23	NEWS	European Day of Languages 2020	 This initiative dates back to 2001, when the Council organised the European Year of Languages for the first time. At the launch in 2001, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe and the European Commissioner for Education and Culture declared in a joint statement that ‘everybody deserves the chance to benefit from the cultural and economic advantages language skills can bring. Learning languages also helps to develop tolerance and understanding between people from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds’. It is in this spirit that, year after year, events have been organised for the European Day of Languages. This year, due to the COVID-19 crisis, celebrations will be taking place online, and will include the following initiatives: The European Commission will hold an online conference on 28 September from 10:00 until 12:00 (registration required by 24 September at the latest), during which guest speakers will discuss the role of language skills in the context of the European Education Area. They will also analyse how to boost foreign language learning and incorporate language diversity and support literacy in all languages in schools. The European Commission’s Directorate-General for Translation (DGT) is running a campaign on social media throughout the month of September to promote the translation profession. The key messages are that we can find translation all around us, that professional translators can be a means of boosting business, and that translation is a modern, highly developed profession that offers plenty of potential for students and young people. The social media accounts used for this campaign are: facebook.com/TranslatingForEurope, facebook.com/translatores, twitter.com/translatores, instagram.com/translatingforeurope, youtube.com/DGTranslation. On 26 September, the European Parliament is organising its Multilingualism Day, offering virtual workshops (prior registration on a ‘first come, first served’ basis is required) on various topics such as ‘A day in the life of a translator and an interpreter’, ‘How do I become a translator or an interpreter?, ‘Translation traineeships’ and ‘How technology is changing the roles and ways of working of translators and interpreters’. For a bit of fun, have a look at the ‘Secret agent’s handbook of language challenges’ designed by the Council of Europe. It contains 51 challenges that encourage language learners to take risks and any opportunities they have to practise a language they are learning outside the classroom. At the Translation Centre, our main purpose being to respond to the translation and language-related needs of the EU agencies, we are fully behind the celebration of the European Day of Languages. It is an initiative that serves to remind us every year that one of the European Union’s key assets is cultural and linguistic diversity. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/european-day-languages-2020
CDT_NEWS_0133	2020-10-30	NEWS	IATE at the EU Open Data Explained (ODE) webinar on 9 November 2020	 At this session, two highly practical tools available as open data to translators, interpreters or providers of content in multiple languages will be introduced: the EU-specific terminology database IATE (InterActive Terminology for Europe), developed and managed by the Translation Centre on behalf of the IATE partners; and the multilingual Translation Memory Euramis, managed by the Directorate-General for Translation (DGT) of the European Commission and regularly enriched by different EU institutions. IATE will be presented by the Centre’s IATE tool manager, who will speak about features for searching, retrieving and reusing data: Basic and expanded search Results and metadata Advanced search and exports for internal users Possibilities for external users: use of IATE public search APIs and downloading data with a limited set of metada The DGT Terminology Coordination Unit will then present a specific case, namely how the COVID-19 collection was built in IATE. Subsequently, representatives from the DGT’s Informatics Unit will go into the specific features of Euramis. There will be Q&A slots for the attendants. The webinar is open for registration and participation is free of charge.

CDT_NEWS_0134	2020-11-20	NEWS	The European Public Prosecutor's Office becomes the Centre’s 69th client	 Given the confidential nature of the documents to be handled by the EPPO, the Centre and the Office have agreed on a specific on-premise machine translation solution, namely Custom Machine Translation as a Service, which will be available 24/7 to the client. Building on the work undertaken by the European Commission, and the Centre’s own activities in the area of machine translation technology, this service is based on dedicated, secure and customised automatic translation software. In practical terms, the Centre’s service package for the EPPO will include the provision of all necessary resources, including management of the solution, and the periodic linguistic maintenance, quality control and assessment of the translation engines. The signing of this agreement illustrates again that the Centre can offer to its clients, not only traditional services, but also tailor-made services, by combining attentive listening to clients' needs, flexibility to adapt working methods, use of technological advances, and inspiration from its long-standing experience. The Centre looks forward to helping the EPPO effectively carry out its important mission for the benefit of EU citizens.   The EPPO: The EU’s answer to fighting crimes against the EU budget In October 2017, the Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, creating the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO). Since then, the EPPO has been establishing its operational structure at all levels and the Office will be operational in early 2021. The mission of this new and independent EU body is to fight large-scale crime, with powers to investigate and prosecute crimes committed against the EU budget through fraud or corruption. In this way, the EU provides itself with a supranational and cross-border mechanism to protect its financial interests and avoid significant economic damage. The EPPO is located in Luxembourg and, to date, the participating countries are 22 out of the 27 EU Member States: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. In September 2019, the European Parliament and the Council appointed Ms Laura Codruta Kövesi as the first European Chief Prosecutor. In July 2020, the Council appointed the 22 prosecutors representing the Member State participants.   More information on the EPPO is available here and in this video: Image: EPPO video, European Commission 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/european-public-prosecutors-office-becomes-centres-69th-client
CDT_NEWS_0135	2020-12-17	NEWS	New services as from January 2021: Automatic Transcription, Automatic Translation, Paste ‘n’ Go	 Combining our know-how with the use of the most advanced and accessible technologies has allowed us to extend the service offer for our clients. From the start of 2021, they will thus be able to benefit from the following three new services: Automatic Transcription, Automatic Translation and Paste ‘n’ Go, the first two resulting from the fruitful cooperation with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO): Automatic transcription complements the transcription service already available since June this year and builds entirely on the reliable speech-to-text technology integrated into our production workflow. This service may be advantageous for clients who need the written text of a recording quickly, but not necessarily with 100% accuracy. Automatic translation represents the first step on our way towards modularising our flagship product ‘Translation’. This service relies on the Centre’s custom machine translation engines in combination with our translation memories. The fully automated processing of incoming requests will result in sufficiently comprehensible translations in a very short time and at a highly attractive price. The Paste ‘n’ Go service has been designed to speed up the process of creating requests and retrieving translations of short, unformatted texts through a dedicated web form on our Client Portal. It will enable clients to reduce costs and turnaround times while obtaining a high-quality translation thanks to a partially automated workflow and the involvement of the Centre’s expert linguists. The Centre’s diversified service offer responds to our clients’ evolving business language needs and is a proof of our commitment to finding innovative solutions for their future challenges.   Link to Transcription leaflet Link to Modularising translation leaflet  	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/new-services-january-2021-automatic-transcription-automatic-translation-paste-n-go
CDT_NEWS_0136	2020-12-18	NEWS	Our best wishes for 2021!	 The Centre has proved to be not only structurally robust but also agile over the recent months of disruptions caused by Covid-19. When the Centre sent the vast majority of its staff to work from home full time in March, our activities were not interrupted in any way and we were able to continue to serve our clients, whilst bringing the transformation plan to a successful conclusion. Thanks to this plan, we have been able to launch new services, optimise our workflows and create new platforms for internal and external collaboration. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to our stakeholders for their cooperation throughout this very atypical year. We wish each and every one of you a relaxing festive period and, above all, a healthy and prosperous 2021. 	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/our-best-wishes-2021
CDT_NEWS_0137	2020-12-17	NEWS	Final sprint towards our transformation	 The Transformation Plan 2019-2020 covers four areas (translation technology; human resources; quality and client orientation; and institutional aspects) as shown in the picture above. The main aims of the plan were to introduce structural changes, implement state-of-the-art translation technologies, including machine translation, and create new services for clients. The transformation process included a separate programme agreed with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), covering a number of specific IT projects of strategic importance for both organisations. What are the main achievements? As a result of our intense cooperation with the EUIPO, we have: developed new services for our clients, such as transcription based on automatic speech recognition, which was launched in June this year, and we have optimised some of our existing services, such as subtitling, language consultancy and translation. In January 2021, we will start offering new services in the areas of translation and transcription; launched our first mobile application eCdT4me, available both on Google Play Store and Apple App Store, which allows our clients as well as our freelance and in-house translators to stay connected and interact with us on language service requests; enhanced our workflows through the integration of relevant tools, thus yielding efficiency and quality gains for us and our clients: Euramis, eTranslation, the Centre’s own custom machine translation engines in the fields of public health and intellectual property, and IATE are now fully embedded in the Centre’s translation process and workflow management activities. Moreover, a new user-friendly translation feedback interface, based on the Corrected Version Request (CVR) and fully connected to the Centre’s Client Portal and workflow management system eCdT, has replaced the former Client Satisfaction Form (CSF) process; come up with a new annual survey approach to measure client satisfaction, which will be put in place from Q1/2021. This will allow the Centre to better monitor the activity status and satisfaction level for each client and enhance client management. In addition, the Centre invested in other enhancements aimed at facilitating our clients’ work, such as the budgetary forecast functionality now available on the Client Portal, or the web translation module for Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 based websites. We have also established the Workflow Management Section as a single operational contact point for our clients. The Section is now managing all workflow steps, from the receipt of the request to the ‘after-sales’ service, as well as the Client Portal. Moreover, the actions included in our transformation plan have enabled us to gain efficiency in the area of human resource management and to invest in specific training for our staff (e.g. post-editing of machine translation; transcription; optimised subtitling; management of translation memories). At the start of 2021, as part of the implementation of Activity Based Management (ABM), Activity Based Budgeting (ABB) and Activity Based Costing (ABC) at the Centre, we will be using a new system for activity and resource allocation. Finally, over the last two years we have fostered interinstitutional cooperation. It is well worth mentioning here that the progress achieved by the Centre in the field of machine translation and its close cooperation with the Commission’s DG Translation have recently made it possible for us to sign an agreement with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) on a service offer tailored to the Office’s needs. It should also be noted that our eCdT workflow management system has obtained a lot of interest from the EU institutions’ translation services. Likewise, we are regularly sharing our experience in the areas of automatic speech recognition, transcription and subtitling with our institutional partners. Most importantly, however, our transformation has helped us to consolidate the Centre as a modern EU language service provider and has opened up new business opportunities. More than ever, we are happy to see our clients turn to us for our expert advice in response to their specific multilingual needs, be it for website localisation, a review of their multilingual strategy, management of workflows and requests involving Member States, non-EU translations or transcription work. The transformation plan has enabled us to move from a one-size-fits-all language service provider to a service provider with a richer, more diversified offer that responds to clients’ specific needs.       	https://cdt.europa.eu/en/news/final-sprint-towards-our-transformation
