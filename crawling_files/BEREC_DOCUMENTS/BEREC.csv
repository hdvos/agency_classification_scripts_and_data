BEREC_UNK_0001	8958	2021-10-06	UNK	BEREC proposals for a swift, effective and future-proof regulatory intervention towards digital gatekeepers	BEREC proposals for a swift, effective and future-proof regulatory intervention towards digital gatekeepers 06 October 2021 Tweet After a couple of workshops and a public consultation round, BEREC has adopted and published its final Report on the ex-ante regulation of digital gatekeepers. During their engagement, stakeholders broadly supported most of the BEREC views and recognised the relevance and legitimacy of BEREC taking a stance on the ex-ante regulation of digital gatekeepers. Thanks to feedback from the industry and other stakeholders – including civil society representatives – BEREC improved its draft document. BEREC now further details and reinforces its initial proposals, such as the remedy-tailoring, the set-up of an Advisory Board for Digital Markets Act (DMA), the need and conditions for a regulatory dialogue with different types of stakeholders and BEREC proposal for a dispute resolution mechanism in the context of the DMA.  The BEREC Report highlights the need for an ex-ante asymmetric regulatory intervention towards digital gatekeepers, since it is key to ensure that competition and innovation are encouraged, end-users’ interests protected, and that the digital environment is open and competitive. While supporting a regulatory intervention at the EU level, BEREC believes that national competent independent authorities have existing skills on which the European Commission can rely on in the enforcement of the DMA.  BEREC will present the final document and the outcomes of the public consultation during its public debriefing on 6 October in Brussels. BEREC also invites stakeholders to take the opportunity to meet the BEREC Working Group Co-chairs during the BEREC Stakeholder Forum on 28 October in Brussels.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8958-berec-proposals-for-a-swift-effective-and-future-proof-regulatory-intervention-towards-digital-gatekeepers
BEREC_UNK_0002	8965	2021-10-06	UNK	Harmonised definitions for over-the-top services indicators	Harmonised definitions for over-the-top services indicators 06 October 2021 Tweet To help National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and stakeholders collect relevant data regarding over-the-top (OTT) services, BEREC has elaborated its harmonised definitions for a limited number of indicators. In defining the metrics, BEREC focused on the voice, video and messaging interpersonal communication services provided over the internet (NI-ICS) and on video streaming services.  During the 48th BEREC plenary meeting, the Board of Regulators adopted the “BEREC Report on harmonised definitions for indicators regarding over-the-top services, relevant to the electronic communications markets”. In the future, the identified indicators are expected to reduce the costs borne by service providers for complying with the data requests of different authorities. The metric definitions included in the Report are seen as a minimum, targeted list to cover the majority of the NRAs’ informational needs and optimize the data collection processes under their remit, to the benefit of the smooth monitoring of markets and to the stakeholders’ convenience. At the same time, NRAs are granted flexibility in ultimately deciding on which metrics to focus more, as well as with respect to the data collection periods. Keeping in mind that the final indicators included in the Report may not cover all the NRAs’ future needs for data, BEREC stresses that NRAs requesting data should at all times justify the necessity of the data, consider the proportionality of the request and attend to any confidentiality-related issues. In drafting this Report, BEREC has considered the views stakeholders expressed during the workshop and through their written contributions to the public consultation.  In the future, BEREC will continue to evaluate the list of common indicators and may add, remove or adjust indicators to ensure a continued harmonisation of the data collected by NRAs and adjust it to their needs. Opportunity to engage with BEREC experts On 6 October 2021, BEREC will hold a public debriefing to present the adopted documents. The BEREC Chair, Michel Van Bellinghen (BIPT, Belgium), and the Co-chairs of the BEREC Working Groups will present BEREC’s recent work and reply to stakeholders’ questions. Please register your interest in attending the event. On 28 October 2021, BEREC will hold its Stakeholder Forum. This time, it envisages an informal atmosphere for meeting the Working Group Co-chairs and sharing ideas and views on the current challenges in telecoms. Places are limited, therefore register your participation on time.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8965-harmonised-definitions-for-over-the-top-services-indicators
BEREC_UNK_0003	8943	2021-10-05	UNK	Public consultation on the mobile and fixed backhaul ex-ante regulation	Public consultation on the mobile and fixed backhaul ex-ante regulation 05 October 2021 Tweet Backhaul is an essential element supporting fixed and mobile electronic communication services in the retail market. However, not every service provider – either mobile or fixed – active in the electronic communications market has a complete own backhaul network at its disposal. Such undertakings have to source inputs from other actors to meet their backhaul network requirements. BEREC invites stakeholders to provide their input to the draft report on fixed and mobile backhaul launched for public consultation on 5 October 2021. The overall objective of the document is to present the legal provisions applicable to mobile and fixed backhaul, the views from operators and their and current and future needs for backhaul, as well as the regulation in force and the use of different types of backhaul networks and services in Europe. Results of the BEREC questionnaires Earlier, during the research phase, a total of 35 National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), 60 operators and two operators’ associations in Europe replied to BEREC questionnaires on this topic. Most NRAs regulating backhaul consider both traditional leased lines and ethernet services as regulated active wholesale products. Apart from those, access to passive infrastructures such as ducts and poles is also imposed by the majority of NRAs handling inputs for backhaul. Both the national regulatory bodies and operators consider backhaul as very important.   The responses provided by the operators on mobile backhaul suggest that there will be a significant shift from radio links to fibre connections driven by the rollout of 5G in the upcoming years. These fibre connections are expected to be mainly self-supplied, but there is also an expected increase in the demand for dark fibre and passive infrastructure from third parties.  BEREC will continue monitoring the evolution of backhaul use and needs, as well as its regulation by NRAs of wholesale inputs for backhaul, with a special focus on backhaul needs and use for 5G deployment and the application of the new recommendation on relevant markets that entered into force in December 2020.  Opportunity to engage in discussion  On 6 October 2021, in Brussels, BEREC will hold a public debriefing on the outcomes of the plenary meetings. Among other topics, the BEREC Market and Economic Analysis Working Group Co-chairs will also present the draft document and reply to stakeholders’ questions. The public consultation on the draft report will run from 5 October until 5 November. The final document is planned to be adopted in the first quarter of 2022.  The stakeholders are also invited to meet and greet the BEREC working group Co-chairs at the BEREC Stakeholder Forum on 28 October in Brussels. Participation at the “Meet&Greet” sessions is upon registration and depends on availability.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8943-public-consultation-on-the-mobile-and-fixed-backhaul-ex-ante-regulation

BEREC_UNK_0005	8924	2021-09-29	UNK	Strengthening regional cooperation: BEREC hosts the Four-lateral Summit	Strengthening regional cooperation: BEREC hosts the Four-lateral Summit 29 September 2021 Tweet On 29 September 2021, in Dubrovnik, Croatia, regulators from various world regions gathered together at the Four-lateral Summit. Representatives of BEREC, EaPeReg, REGULATEL and EMERG agreed that regulators play a crucial role in promoting competition to spur necessary investments by the sector. It also helps achieve coverage in commercially less attractive areas where there is little demand and the costs of rolling out the networks are relatively high.  With challenges arising from the connectivity in the digital world, continual cooperation among regulators is crucial. Citizens and businesses can benefit from the digital economy, if these challenges are addressed at the regulatory level.  “With all eyes on digital, we have a unique opportunity before us to connect the world.  Regulators are at the helm as architects of a digitally-empowered future for all, and we must collaborate across sectors to drive inclusive digital transformation,” emphasized Doreen Bogdan-Martin, the Director of the Telecommunication Development Bureau of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in her keynote speech.  The cooperation among the EU Member states is significant to achieve the targets of the digital transformation of the Union. Kamila Kloc, Deputy Director and Head of Unit at DG CNECT, European Commission, introduced the audience to the Digital Decade programme policy, pointing out the declaration of digital principles and national strategic roadmaps to pursue the digital targets at the national level.  The summit delegates also agreed that there is a significant common benefit to be derived from a cooperative dialogue on common issues between regulators from Europe and other regions of the world – namely Latin America, North Africa and the Middle East, and Eastern Europe – as challenges and solutions are often similar.  Summit participants recalled the cooperative principles enshrined at the Memoranda of Understanding already signed between BEREC and its counterparts from EMERG, EaPeReg and REGULATEL, recognising the common interest in renovating the activities included in it. Building upon already existent cooperative liaisons, the participants of the Summit recognised the benefit of promoting permanent initiatives of cooperation.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8924-strengthening-regional-cooperation-berec-hosts-the-four-lateral-summit

The BEREC Chair also noted that with the adoption of the Electronic Communications Code, the role of national and international regulators has changed. Nowadays regulators need to factor in more societal perspectives, such as bridging the digital divide and making sure connectivity is promoted. Michel Van Bellinghen added that we are moving towards a regulatory framework with additional pieces of soft law, such as the Commission’s Recommendations, the Connectivity Toolbox, BEREC Guidelines and an overall focus on sustainability. In the backdrop of the recently announced Digital compass outlining targets for Europe’s digital transformation by 2030 and the ambitions for rapid build-out of fibre and 5G networks, the BEREC Chair emphasised that the fast rollout of fibre and 5G networks is a prerequisite for the long-term competitiveness and sustainability of the EU. He said: “BEREC prioritises work that improves the general conditions for the expansion and take-up of secure, competitive and reliable high-capacity networks across Europe while ensuring a smooth transition from legacy infrastructures.” Michel Van Bellinghen invited stakeholders to participate in the public consultation on the BEREC Work Programme 2022, which will be launched on 6 October 2021. The BEREC Chair said that promoting full connectivity will be the centre of gravity of the BEREC work next year. He also informed the audience that BEREC would issue a report about the regulatory treatment for fixed and mobile backhaul – a key for enabling 5G and facilitating the deployment of high-speed networks, especially in non-densely populated areas. BEREC is currently preparing a snapshot on how backhaul is addressed in market analysis by National Regulatory Authorities, i.e., whether it is regulated or not, under which wholesale market and which remedies apply. The document will also present BEREC’s conclusions with a particular focus on future needs and regulation of backhaul. The virtual annual FTTH conference took place on 16 September 2021. It brought together technical and regulatory experts, senior government and industry representatives, policymakers, regulators and investors to discuss all aspects of FTTH, 5G and other fibre-related and enabling technologies and services and their benefit to society."	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8866-moving-towards-a-regulatory-framework-with-additional-pieces-of-soft-law-promoting-full-connectivity-across-the-eu
BEREC_UNK_0011	8506	2021-09-07	UNK	 BEREC assesses the impact of the recent Court of Justice of the EU judgements on the Open Internet Regulation	BEREC assesses the impact of the recent Court of Justice of the EU judgements on the Open Internet Regulation 07 September 2021 Tweet The Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) takes note of the three judgements issued by the Court of Justice of the EU on 2 September regarding violation of the European Union net neutrality rules. The CJEU judgements state that the practices by two German mobile operators (Telekom Deutschland and Vodafone) are incompatible with the EU Open Internet Regulation. BEREC aims at fostering the independent, consistent and high-quality regulation of digital markets for the benefit of Europe and its citizens. To contribute to the consistent application of the Open Internet Regulation and promote an effective internal market in the electronic communications sector, Article 5(3) of the Open Internet Regulation explicitly obliges BEREC to issue guidelines for implementing the obligations of National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) under the Regulation. In 2020, BEREC reviewed the Open Internet Guidelines in accordance with its mandate under the Open Internet Regulation. Since 2017, BEREC has annually published Reports on the implementation of the Open Internet Regulation, monitoring and ensuring compliance with the Regulation. BEREC and its members also discuss cases and questions to ensure a predictable and consistent application of the Open Internet Regulation. The BEREC Guidelines will need to be reviewed in light of the Court’s decision to reflect the interpretation of the CJEU ruling.  To express the ramifications of the judgements on the European legal framework and the BEREC Guidelines on the Implementation of the Open Internet Regulation, BEREC is currently analysing the ruling. The Board of Regulators will discuss the potential implications and next steps during its 48th BEREC ordinary meeting on 30 September 2021. The outcomes of the discussion on the incorporation of the CJEU ruling in the BEREC Guidelines on the Implementation of the Open Internet will be presented by the BEREC Chair 2021 during BEREC’s public debriefing on 6 October 2021.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8506-berec-assesses-the-impact-of-the-recent-court-of-justice-of-the-eu-judgements-on-the-open-internet-regulation

In its draft measure, ComReg notifies national retail markets for fixed telephony services and urban and regional wholesale markets for fixed telephony. The draft measure proposes to designate Eircom as having significant market power in the relevant regional wholesale FACO market. On 16 July 2021, the EC sent a serious doubts letter opening a phase II investigation pursuant to Article 32 of Directive (EU) 2018/1972. The EC's serious doubts concern the market definition proposed by ComReg, the three criteria test and the SMP assessment. Based on the analysis set out in its Opinion, BEREC considers that the EC’s serious doubts are partially justified, namely with regard to the substantiation of the geographic market definition, in particular the regional FACO market. However, with regard to the product market definition of the RFTS and FACO markets, the three criteria test, as well as the majority of the significant market power analysis, BEREC does not share the EC’s serious doubts.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8500-berec-adopted-a-berec-opinion-on-phase-ii-investigation-ie20212332-2333

At the roundtable, BEREC Chair Michel Van Bellinghen, incoming BEREC Chair Annemarie Sipkes and outgoing Chair Dan Sjöblom represented the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications. The Board of Regulators welcomed the opportunity to discuss relevant regulatory issues with its stakeholders in the backdrop of the Mobile World Congress. Connectivity challenges One of BEREC's strategic priorities is the promotion of full connectivity throughout Europe. BEREC highly supports this process, which will boost investment in very high-capacity broadband connectivity infrastructure, including 5G, on a European-wide level. During the session dedicated to the connectivity challenges, Dan Sjöblom said that BEREC prioritises work that improves the general conditions for the expansion and take-up of secure, competitive and reliable high-capacity networks, both fixed and wireless, across Europe while ensuring a smooth transition from legacy infrastructures. Misuse of asymmetric power in the context of DSA/DMA During the discussion round on how to address the misuse of asymmetric power by large platforms in the context of the Digital Services Act/Digital Markets Act, BEREC Chair Michel Van Bellinghen said that BEREC strongly supports the ex-ante concept of the DMA and advocates making it an effective enforcement framework. He highlighted that ex-ante principles and a set of general tailored remedies using these ex-ante principles could be added in addition to directly applicable obligations. The BEREC Chair also emphasized the importance of involving other stakeholders such as business users as this might increase the acceptance of regulation, helping to ensure its effective implementation. He finally also suggested involving national independent authorities to assist the Commission in making the DMA a success story. End-user empowerment The incoming BEREC Chair Annemarie Sipkes discussed the policies empowering end-users to make better-informed choices in the fast-evolving digital ecosystem. During the discussion, she outlined that by the end of 2021, BEREC will prepare an Opinion on the market and technological developments and their impact on the application of rights of end-users in the European Electronic Communications Code. Among others, the Opinion will also examine to what extent end-users of all electronic communications services can make free and informed choices based on complete contractual information and can switch their provider of electronic communications services easily. It will be the first time BEREC will prepare an Opinion on this. The co-legislators have entrusted BEREC to continue its work and prepare its Opinion every three years to have a whole picture of the development and the impact of the application of end-user rights. Europe’s Digital transformation 2030 In addition to the exchange of views between GSMA and BEREC members, the BEREC Chair also participates in a roundtable discussion with the European Internet Forum (EIF) and the GSMA, to be held on 30 June. The event, bringing together legislators, regulators and stakeholders, will focus on the role of 5G connectivity in driving Europe’s economic recovery during and post COVID-19. Speakers will address how to accelerate 5G deployment in Europe.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8431-possible-misuse-of-asymmetric-power-and-connectivity-challenges-in-focus-of-berec-gsma-annual-roundtable

The BEREC Chair welcomed the GSR-21 Best Practice Guidelines, particularly the focus on whole-of-government collaboration at the national and local level. Regulation in the digital era should evolve more into cross-border collaboration and coordination on issues related to digital markets, such as privacy, security, protection of end-users etc. He explained that BEREC is committed to cooperating closely on digital issues with competent bodies in the different sectors in the near future and will develop a medium-term strategy on institutional cooperation.    The following day, the Regulatory associations continued the discussion. During this session, the incoming BEREC Chair Annemarie Sipkes highlighted the work BEREC has done by issuing guidelines regarding broadband mapping. On June 23, 2021, the BEREC Chair Michel Van Bellinghen moderated the session Connectivity4digital transformation: regulatory enablers. In the opening remarks, the BEREC Chair, among other topics, highlighted the importance of the digital resilience of networks, with the lessons learned during the pandemics in 2020 and 2021. The session participants also expressed their views on the importance of sharing spectrum, networks and infrastructure. The speakers also discussed whether fair competition in a globalised digital world is a reality.   This year (June 21-25, 2021), the 21st Global Symposium for Regulators organised by the International Telecommunications Union focused on regulation for digital transformation, accelerating inclusive connectivity. The event serves as a unique discussion and exchange platform that provides regulators and policymakers worldwide with interactive high-level panels on topical and innovative policy and regulatory issues.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8416-berec-prioritises-the-work-on-improving-take-up-of-very-high-capacity-networks
BEREC_UNK_0015	8407	2021-06-18	UNK	BEREC publishes Guidelines on Geographical surveys of network deployments – Verification of information	BEREC publishes Guidelines on Geographical surveys of network deployments – Verification of information 18 June 2021 Tweet These new Guidelines provide guidance on how to verify the indicators defined in the Core Guidelines to assist National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) in the consistent application of Geographical surveys of network deployments, namely indicators characterising the current reach and quality of service of broadband networks as declared by the operator, including the declaration of an area or grid covered by a very high capacity network.  In this document, BEREC describes the verification methods and provides recommendations to be considered by NRAs and/or Other Competent Authorities (OCAs) (hereinafter ‘Authorities’), who may choose among various methods according to their needs and the availability of information. However, the validation of address databases and the verification of information regarding planned deployments are out of the currently published Guidelines' scope.  Authorities should publish their verification methodologies and underbuild the verification results to establish transparency and make their proceedings plausible to market participants. The draft Guidelines were subject to a public consultation from 15 December 2020 to 27 January 2021. BEREC received seven contributions from operators, operators‘ associations, public bodies and other stakeholders. BEREC has adopted the final version at the 47th BEREC plenary meeting held on 10-11 June 2021.  The entire set of BEREC Guidelines with respect to this matter (BEREC Guidelines to assist NRAs on the consistent application of Geographical surveys of network deployments – i.e. the Core Guidelines; BEREC Guidelines on Geographical surveys of network deployments Article 22 (2), 22 (3) and 22 (4); and the current BEREC Guidelines on geographical surveys of network deployments - Verification of information) constitute the unique basis for the consistent implementation of broadband mapping activities within the purposes of Article 22 of the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) and other related Article 22 activities. BEREC has also published a handbook containing all three mentioned Guidelines, for convenience and ease of reference.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8407-berec-publishes-guidelines-on-geographical-surveys-of-network-deployments-verification-of-information

BEREC will also launch the public consultation on the draft report covering the COVID-19 lessons learned and identify future-proof measures to tackle similar crises. The registered participants of the public debriefing can place their questions in the registration form or ask during the event. General authorisation The European Electronic Communications Code tasks BEREC to publish by 21 December 2021, and every three years thereafter, an Opinion on the national implementation and functioning of the general authorisation and their impact on the functioning of the internal market.  During the 47th BEREC ordinary meeting, the Board of Regulators decided to launch a call to interested stakeholders to provide their inputs in the light of any issues identified in the field, both in the EU legislative framework and in national implementation solutions, by means of answering to a set of questions.  Such inputs will be taken into account by BEREC within the elaboration of its Opinion. All stakeholders are invited to submit their inputs by 26 July 2021 close of business to General_Authorisation@berec.europa.eu, preferably in English. The Board of Regulators will adopt and submit the BEREC Opinion on the national implementation and functioning of the general authorisation to the European Commission in December 2021.  COVID-19 experiences and how future-proof NRAs are The Board of Regulators also decided to launch a public consultation on the draft BEREC Report on the COVID-19 crisis: lessons learned regarding communications networks and services for a resilient society. Among other topics, the report will focus on the measures adopted at national level, focusing on NRAs’ actions to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of electronic communication networks and services.  The draft report collects case studies and draws regulatory lessons to ensure that European electronic communication networks are future-proof.  Stakeholders are invited to submit their contributions here by 26 July 2021 close of business.

BEREC_UNK_0017	8371	2021-06-11	UNK	BEREC adopts proposals to contribute to the debate on the Digital Markets Act 	BEREC adopts proposals to contribute to the debate on the Digital Markets Act 11 June 2021 Tweet At the 47th ordinary meeting, BEREC adopted two proposals to further contribute to the debate on the European Commission’s (EC) Digital Markets Act (DMA). One proposal focuses  on remedy-tailoring and the need for structured participation processes involving stakeholders, while the second one develops on the set-up of an Advisory Board in the DMA.  Proposal on remedy-tailoring In this proposal, BEREC explains why and how, on top of the directly-applicable obligations, ex ante principles and a set of  remedies (‘toolbox’) should be included in the DMA proposal in order to make this regulation future-proof and fit for purpose in such fast-evolving digital environments.   Building on its experience in imposing regulatory measures on specific service providers (asymmetric regulation), BEREC presents the rationale and advantages of defining ex ante principles in the law and tailoring appropriate remedies to address new and unforeseen practices and to appropriately tackle the challenges that gatekeepers may raise in the (near) future.  Moreover, for the DMA regulatory intervention to be effective, and thus irrespective of the proposal of remedy-tailoring, BEREC also suggests that a structured regulatory dialogue should take place involving all relevant types of stakeholders and that dispute resolution mechanisms could be set up.  Proposal on the set-up of an Advisory Board in the DMA The BEREC position paper on the set-up of an Advisory Board in the DMA develops on the merits of establishing an Advisory Board to the EC. It would be composed of National Independent Authorities (NIAs) with relevant and cross-sectoral expertise to support the EC in enforcing the DMA Regulation and, thus, complement the Digital Markets Act Committee (DMAC).  The NIAs in the Advisory Board would contribute to the enforcement of the Regulation thanks to, inter alia, the advantage of their constant interaction with national players and users, the constant monitoring of markets and innovations (which is already part of their daily activities) and their existing expertise in ex ante regulation. As to the Advisory Board’s features, BEREC refers to positive experiences with similar advisory bodies to the EC currently in place, also mentioning the positive experience in the electronic communications field. As for its juridical form, BEREC suggests drawing inspiration from its own original and innovative layout, which preserves operational flexibility and effectiveness and ensures that regulatory decisions are coherent and consistent across Europe.  Finally, BEREC also provides a relevant list of tasks that the Advisory Board could carry out (among which coordinated data collection and monitoring throughout the EU, raising awareness on specific concerns or issues emerged at national level, ensure that DMA decisions are coherent with other related regulation, support the EC in checking compliance with the obligations defined at EU level, …). Opportunity for questions During the BEREC public debriefing on 16 June 2021, at 14:00 CEST, the BEREC Chair together with the Working Group Co-chairs will present the adopted documents and answer questions received from the participants.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8371-berec-adopts-proposals-to-contribute-to-the-debate-on-the-digital-markets-act

BEREC_UNK_0019	8356	2021-06-02	UNK	International cooperation – a significant part of BEREC’s work	International cooperation – a significant part of BEREC’s work 02 June 2021 Tweet The ‘smart regulation’, ICT sector recovery and future cooperation - in the focus of the annual summit between BEREC and the Latin American Forum of Telecommunications Regulators (REGULATEL), held today, 2 June 2021. In his opening remarks, the BEREC Chair Michel Van Bellinghen (BIPT, Belgium) emphasized the significance of international cooperation in the digital world. He noted that international collaboration had become one of BEREC’s work priorities as of last year. International cooperation allows exchange on cross-border and common issues and closely following global trends in technology and changing business models. It enables BEREC to retain its capacity to meet future challenges effectively. Moreover, BEREC has started to develop a Medium-Term Strategy for international cooperation. The strategy will seek to establish a systematic and structured approach to identify international relationships, which are beneficial to attaining BEREC’s priorities and fulfilment of its work programme, in line with BEREC’s resources. The BEREC Chair assured that in the future, Latin America would remain one of the priority regions of BEREC.  In the discussion panels, the BEREC Vice chairs Dan Sjoblom (PTS, Sweden), Annemarie Sipkes (ACM, The Netherlands) and Jesmond Bugeja (MCA, Malta), together with the colleagues from REGULATEL, discussed “smart regulation, and ICT indicators and the future cooperation between the regulators in Europe and South America. Furthermore, Verana Weber, representing OECD, touched upon the important topic of economic recovery, during a keynote speech. BEREC already has a long history of cooperation with regulatory networks in other regions, and the cooperation with REGULATEL is one of the longest. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed in 2013 and extended in 2015, 2017 and 2019. The regulators of the two continents have multiple mutual interests. The global pandemic has shown how essential, resilient global electronic communication networks are for the economies; therefore, more regulatory cooperation concerning different aspects of these networks is needed.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8356-international-cooperation-a-significant-part-of-berecs-work

BEREC_UNK_0022	8334	2021-05-19	UNK	Proposals of revised NIS 2 Directive raises concerns over the European Electronic Communications Code fragmentation – says BEREC Opinion	Proposals of revised NIS 2 Directive raises concerns over the European Electronic Communications Code fragmentation – says BEREC Opinion 19 May 2021 Tweet On 19 May 2021, the BEREC Board of Regulators adopted an Opinion on the revised Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS2.0 Directive) and its effect on Electronic Communications.  On 16 December 2020, the EC published a proposal that expands the current scope of the NIS Directive by adding new sectors based on their significance for the economy and society - the public electronic communications networks (ECN) and electronic communications services (ECS) now fall within the scope of essential entities. The proposal further strengthens security requirements for the relevant entities with an applicable minimum list of critical security elements. The proposed NIS2.0 Directive also suggests transferring the current security provisions in Articles 40 and 41 of the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) to the NIS Directive. BEREC’s concerns  BEREC recognizes a rationale for the proposal to collect all critical infrastructures under one security framework; however, it raises concerns about the effects of fragmenting the EECC. BEREC outlines that the electronic communications sector already has its own sector-specific, comprehensive and proven regulatory framework that considers all perspectives, including security, economic analysis, competition law and other regulatory issues. This holistic approach to the security of the electronic communications sector, which has successfully adapted to the changing security landscape, has proven its merit. The industry cannot afford the risk of losing the experience with legal, technical and economic aspects of security in the current framework, built over ten years. Moreover, BEREC raises concerns over the effect of the proposed changes on the ECN and ECS markets and the overall common security level reached with the targeted measures established since 2009. The BEREC Opinion explains that the obligations foreseen in the EC’s proposal may be disproportionate for some providers (e.g. small ones) and act as a barrier to market entry. In light of these concerns, BEREC considers it as most appropriate to retain Articles 40 and 41 in the EECC and not change or shift these provisions into the context of the reviewed NIS Directive.  In its Opinion, BEREC also highlights a risk regarding the lack of clarity of the definitions that may result in legal challenges on specific areas of supervision under the NIS 2.0 Directive compared to the EECC.   BEREC recommends  BEREC strongly recommends that the revised Directive introduces sufficient safeguards to ensure the continuation of current practices and builds on the knowledge and experience of current competent authorities for the security of ECN and ECS. BEREC also suggests reviewing and clarifying the definition of “security of network and information systems” in the NIS 2.0 Directive. Finally, BEREC further suggests to assess, how the NIS2.0 Directive could best complement the provisions in the EECC. BEREC will continue following closely the legislative process throughout the year, as foreseen in the Work Programme 2021, and may envisage relevant activities supporting the work of competent bodies.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8334-proposals-of-revised-nis-2-directive-raises-concerns-over-the-european-electronic-communications-code-fragmentation-says-berec-opinion

The event aims at gathering input from stakeholders, such as consumers' associations, digital rights advocacy associations, civil society representatives and alternative businesses on how the DMA proposal could better protect and empower end-users’ rights. Register now. This online workshop is already the second event in potentially a series of BEREC workshops that are focusing on regulating digital markets and services. After opening remarks by the BEREC Chair Michel Van Bellinghen (BIP, Belgium), the Co-chairs of the BEREC Working Group on Market and Economic Analysis Jorge Infante (CNMC, Spain) and Chiara Caccinelli (Arcep, France) will introduce the participants to the BEREC position on the regulation of digital gatekeepers.  Inge Bernaerts, Director for Policy and Strategy at the European Commission's (EC) Directorate General on Competition, will then provide introductory remarks on how the EC envisions the DMA protecting end-users' interests in their relationship with digital gatekeepers. She will be followed by Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) rapporteur for the DMA, Andreas Schwab (EPP), who will lay out the European Parliament's state of play regarding the DMA. During the second part of the workshop, selected stakeholders and experts will then present their positions on the key questions in a roundtable format. The roundtable is structured around key questions such as the consequences of gatekeepers’ dominance in digital ecosystems, adequate tools to protect end-users’ rights and the role of European and national authorities in defining and enforcing regulatory measures. The workshop will then close with a round of questions and answers. The workshop will be livestreamed on a dedicated platform.

The event took place against the backdrop of the Connectivity Toolbox and the recommendations of best practices put forward to help facilitate the most efficient roll-out of very high-capacity networks, including full-fibre broadband.  In his keynote speech, the BEREC Chair highlighted that the Recovery and Resilience Facility agreement as well as the development of the Connectivity Toolbox provided the perfect opportunity for  Member States to rework their National Digital Agendas and Broadband Plans to make them future-proof. In his speech, Michel Van Bellinghen also emphasised that BEREC will continue to prioritise its work to improve the general conditions for the expansion and take-up of secure, competitive and reliable high-capacity networks. BEREC Chair said: “The fast roll-out of fibre networks is a prerequisite for the long-term competitiveness and sustainability of the EU. The pandemic and the Next Generation EU Fund play an impressive role in promoting a boom in supply and demand for digital services.” During the webinar Michel Van Bellinghen also paid attention to the European Electronic Communications Code and the evolution of regulation. He stated that Europe is moving towards a regulatory framework with additional pieces of soft law, such as the Commission’s recommendations, the Connectivity Toolbox, the BEREC Guidelines and others. They have an effect on fostering full connectivity over the EU.  During the event the BEREC Chair noted that the telecom sector is looking forward to the review the Broadband Cost Reduction Directive (BCRD) that is coming up. It aims at further improving the current measures by simplifying permits and procedures to reduce overall administrative burdens in the sector. In light of the planned review of the BCRD, BEREC already provided its Opinion to the Commission. It was based on the experience of its members, in particular as a dispute settlement body and single information point at the national level.   Michel Van Bellinghen concluded his keynote speech touching upon the backhaul infrastructure as a key for enabling 5G and facilitating the deployment of high-speed networks, especially in non-densely populated areas. He informed that BEREC is currently preparing a snapshot on how backhaul is addressed in the market analysis performed by National Regulatory Authorities. BEREC also plans to provide guidance on how to apply any relevant provision regarding backhaul in light of the updated Recommendation on relevant markets and the Code in relation to the market analysis process. BEREC will organise a public consultation in October this year to consult with the stakeholders.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8314-berec-chair-emphasises-the-role-of-the-fast-roll-out-of-fibre-networks-in-ensuring-eus-competitiveness-and-sustainability
BEREC_UNK_0025	8237	2021-04-14	UNK	Sharing regulatory best practices between Europe and Africa: BEREC at the ITU symposium	Sharing regulatory best practices between Europe and Africa: BEREC at the ITU symposium 14 April 2021 Tweet On 14 April 2021, BEREC, represented by the Chair Michel Van Bellinghen and the incoming Chair 2022 Annemarie Sipkes, virtually joined the roundtable discussions on the regulatory dialogue across Europe and Africa, organised by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The BEREC Chair Michel Van Bellinghen (BIPT, Belgium) focused on the strategies, policies, experiences and challenges in sharing regulatory best practices between Europe and Africa. He highlighted the efforts of BEREC to reach out and engage in dialogue with regional organisations and National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) beyond the European Union (EU). This also includes Africa more recently. Michel Van Bellinghen said that regulatory cooperation between BEREC and African Regulators is growing in importance since Africa has a booming electronic communications sector. In 2018, the Policy and Regulatory Initiative for Digital Africa (PRIDA), a joint initiative of the African Union (AU), the EU, and the ITU, was launched to enable legal and regulatory framework development across Africa. BEREC has acknowledged this initiative in its Strategy 2021-2025 and its Work Programmes and has committed itself to support this project. During the forum, the BEREC Chair also pointed out that the COVID-19 crisis has taught the importance of connectivity and that it cannot be underestimated. It should be widely recognised that the telecommunications sector has demonstrated its vital role for societies and economies in Europe and Africa. One of the most pressing issues that the pandemic has shown to the regulators and policymakers is the importance of addressing the so-called digital divide. Promoting full connectivity for all citizens in both continents is one of the main missions arising from this crisis.  BEREC is currently conducting a study on which measures NRAs can take to contribute to further closing the digital divide. The incoming BEREC Chair 2022 Annemarie Sipkes (ACM, the Netherlands) joined a discussion on the regional perspectives for the regulation of digital transformation and discussed the acceleration of inclusive connectivity, access and use, which is a part of BEREC priorities. She said that “BEREC contributes to digital connectivity through evidence based regulation and continuous dialogue.” The empowerment of end-users is especially relevant for inclusive connectivity. Here, the incoming Chair referred to the BEREC study on consumer behaviour and attitudes towards Digital Platforms, which will be published later this spring. She mentioned that it is essential to gain an evidence-based understanding of the interaction between the consumers and the digital platforms. She further presented examples of the work of BEREC in line with its strategic priorities. To promote full connectivity, BEREC will analyse the regulatory treatment for backhaul this year. In addition, to the support of sustainable and open digital markets, BEREC is working on harmonising the definitions for the over-the-top services' indicators.   About the event The “21st Global Symposium for Regulators: Regional Regulatory Roundtable for Europe and Africa” organised by the ITU gathered NRAs, regulatory associations and other international organisations from the two continents. The main aim of the event was to identify the key regulatory priorities at the regional level and foster regulatory dialogue across Europe and Africa.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8237-sharing-regulatory-best-practices-between-europe-and-africa-berec-at-the-itu-symposium

In the first three months of 2021, the traffic on fixed and mobile networks have increased during the Covid-19 crisis; however, no major congestion issues have ever been reported – says the new BEREC summary report, published on 6 April 2021. The published report summarises the main updates of an ongoing information-gathering exercise, and includes the most recent data provided to BEREC by its constituent National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) as of 30 March 2021 to indicate the overall status on internet capacity in their respective countries. Four NRAs have provided updates of substance on the status of internet capacity in their Member State, while 22 NRAs have explicitly mentioned that either the situation remains stable or there is nothing new to report. The National Regulatory Authorities also have responded to the BEREC request on the telecommunications networks' overall status in their respective countries, based on a traffic lights categorisation. All the NRAs reported that networks are working well; Covid-19 is not creating issues for Internet Authentication Service's (IAS) availability or general quality. BEREC will continue the monthly information-gathering exercise. In case of a sufficient amount of new information from NRAs, BEREC will publish the summary report every month.  Otherwise, the standard publication periodicity will be quarterly.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8224-berec-publishes-the-first-summary-report-in-2021-on-the-status-of-internet-network-capacity-regulatory-and-other-measures-in-light-of-the-covid-19-crisis

Already earlier this year, BEREC adopted the Outline BEREC Work Programme 2022, which is reflecting  the objectives of BEREC's work in the upcoming year. The objectives of BEREC's work in 2022 continue to be based on the mandatory tasks stemming from the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) and its four main goals coming out of Article 3 (2) EECC: Promoting connectivity and access to very high capacity networks, Promoting competition and efficient investment, Contributing to the development of the internal market, Promoting the interest of the citizens of the Union. Consistently implementing the EECC continues to be at the forefront of BEREC's work. The BEREC Strategy 2021-2025 and its high-level strategic priorities will be fundamental for meeting the objectives and the work that BEREC will undertake in 2022 overall. Furthermore, BEREC is committed to serving as a body for thoughtful and proactive debate that provides advice to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission in the field of electronic communications. Similarly, BEREC seeks to engage cooperatively and effectively with stakeholders. The Outline Work Programme 2022 also considers the preparation for the new challenges ahead resulting from political, economic and technological developments as an essential task – such as the Green Deal and the Agenda 2030 to foster sustainability. The incoming BEREC Chair encourages all stakeholders and interested parties to provide their views and contributions to the Work Programme 2022. Please forward your input via e-mail to BEREC-WP-2022@berec.europa.eu before 19 April 2021 (EoB). Input should contain: The title of the proposal, Which of BEREC’s proposed high-level strategic priorities, set out in the draft Strategy 2021-25, the project is intended to address, A short description of the project, which will allow BEREC to adequately consider its merits; which developments the project is to address, The name of the proposer, the organisation and contact details. In line with the practice of previous years and in accordance with Article 21 of the BEREC Regulation, the draft BEREC Work Programme 2022 will be consulted with the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on their priorities and will be subject to a public consultation. The public consultation will run for a four-week period in October and November 2021. The final BEREC Work Programme 2022 will be adopted at the final BEREC Board of Regulators meeting of the year, in December 2021. BEREC will publish and transmit the annual work programme to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission as soon as it is adopted.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8204-berec-launches-an-early-stakeholder-input-on-the-work-programme-2022
BEREC_UNK_0029	8208	2021-03-26	UNK	BEREC contributes to the Connectivity Toolbox	BEREC contributes to the Connectivity Toolbox 26 March 2021 Tweet Today, Member States agreed on a final list of best practices to help reach the Gigabit connectivity goals by 2025 and promote full connectivity. The publication of the Connectivity Toolbox kicks off the final step in the European Commission Connectivity Recommendation process, which is the implementation of identified measures. By 30 April 2021, each Member State should provide the Commission with a roadmap for implementing the Toolbox. In parallel to the Member states, the BEREC experts contributed to the Connectivity Recommendation process since its publication on 18 September 2020. During a joint workshop of BEREC and the Cost Reduction Sub-group of the Connectivity Special Group of COCOM, the BEREC experts presented their national experiences and best practices relevant for the Toolbox of the Connectivity Recommendation. The workshop focused on best practices concerning reduction of the cost and increase of the speed of deploying electronic communications networks, in particular, very high capacity networks.  Broadband Cost Reduction Directive The Recommendation calls on the Member States to identify and share a toolbox of best practices to speed up and lower the cost of very high capacity network roll-out and to ensure timely and investment-friendly access to 5G radio spectrum. The Toolbox aims to contribute to the Member States' preparation of their intended reforms in the context of the recovery and resilience plans in the area of digital, to which 20% of the funds have to be allocated. In the past years, BEREC has been actively working on implementing the Broadband Cost Reduction Directive (BCRD) and has published several reports related to this topic. In light of the planned review of the BCRD by the European Commission, BEREC also provided its expertise to the Commission, based on the experience of its members, in particular as a dispute settlement body and single information point at the national level. The BEREC Opinion on the Revision of the Broadband Cost Reduction Directive was published on 16 March 2021. In line with BEREC’s strategic priority of promoting full connectivity throughout Europe, BEREC highly supports this process, which will boost investment in very high-capacity broadband connectivity infrastructure, including 5G, on a European-wide level. BEREC prioritises work that improves the general conditions for the expansion and take-up of secure, competitive and reliable high-capacity networks (both fixed and wireless) across Europe while ensuring a smooth transition from legacy infrastructures.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8208-berec-contributes-to-the-connectivity-toolbox
BEREC_UNK_0030	8165	2021-03-16	UNK	BEREC’s Opinion on the revision of the Broadband Cost Reduction Directive	BEREC’s Opinion on the revision of the Broadband Cost Reduction Directive 16 March 2021 Tweet After the diligent work, the Board of Regulators adopted and published the BEREC Opinion on the Broadband Cost Reduction Directive (BCRD) revision. It is based on previous work related to this topic and the experiences gained by National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) with the BCRD, particularly as a dispute settlement body and single information point at a national level.  BEREC considers that access to existing physical infrastructure and coordination of civil works are important in order to reduce the costs and increase the speed of deploying high-speed electronic communications networks. However, network operators of other sectors and the electronic communications sector are often not interested in sharing their physical infrastructure with (other) electronic communications network operators. Therefore, the Board of Regulators agrees with the European Commission that the principle of the dispute settlement process is very important. Moreover, BEREC sees that the NRAs can play a vital role in this process at the national level. BEREC also endorses the NRAs role in performing the Single Information Point (SIP) functions that ensure transparency on the existing physical infrastructure available, at least for the NRAs which already perform the function of the SIP.  Wireless networks and sustainability The BEREC Opinion also focuses on the topics requested by the European Commission, such as wireless networks (e.g. 5G) and sustainability aspects. The European Commission has identified digital technologies as a critical enabler for attaining the sustainability goals of 'the European Green Deal' in many different sectors. It has also committed to assessing the need for incentives to promote the deployment of more sustainable electronic communications networks as part of the ICT sector's efforts to undergo its green transformation. BEREC emphasises that the coordination of civil works and joint use of existing physical infrastructure might reduce the environmental impact of electronic communications networks deployment. In line with BEREC's strategic priority of promoting full connectivity throughout Europe, BEREC highly supports the investment in very high-capacity broadband connectivity infrastructure, including 5G, on a European-wide level. BEREC prioritises work that improves the general conditions for the expansion and take-up of secure, competitive and reliable high-capacity networks (both fixed and wireless) across Europe, while ensuring a smooth transition from legacy infrastructures.  Shaping Europe's Digital Future In June 2020, the European Commission published a roadmap concerning the revision of the BCRD. The revision is part of the actions announced in the European Commission's Communication 'Shaping Europe's Digital Future'. For digital infrastructure and networks alone, the EU has an investment gap of EUR 65 billion per year. Despite the mobilised national and EU funding resources, it is crucial to further reduce network deployment cost, including for fibre and 5G networks. The Directive aims to facilitate and incentivise the roll-out of high-speed electronic communications networks by promoting the joint use of existing physical infrastructure and enabling a more efficient deployment of new physical infrastructure, in order that such networks can be rolled-out at lower cost.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8165-berecs-opinion-on-the-revision-of-the-broadband-cost-reduction-directive

He said: ”Fast roll-out of 5G networks is a prerequisite for the long-term competitiveness and sustainability of the EU. In the backdrop of the Connectivity Recommendation and the upcoming Broadband Cost Reduction review, we see a turnaround towards the “greening” of telecom infrastructure and services"". 5G is one of BEREC’s strategic priorities set out in the strategy for 2021 – 2025. The BEREC Chair underlined that the challenges to address range from work on standards, interoperability, new business models, spectrum availability to  network sharing, coverage, Quality of Service (QoS), security and resilience. During the virtual event, the BEREC Chair also emphasized that achieving full connectivity by massive deployment of 5G and fiber networks is essential. Therefore, BEREC also dedicates its work to the  copper switch off, backhaul, the Electromagnetic Fields workshop, exchange of 5G experiences and coverage indicators. Michel Van Bellinghen reminded that BEREC is a trustworthy partner to the EU institutions in the backdrop of the European digital policy. Within the NIS Cooperation Group, our expertise already contributes to the analysis of the implementation of 5G toolbox strategic measures, particularly the diversification of suppliers and strengthening national resilience.  During the conference, the BEREC Chair invited to seize the opportunity for enhancing the connectivity, benefiting end-users. With vaccination and end of the winter, the realm of freedom is still away. The improved connectivity will let people celebrate the end of the winter and the advent of the first sun,  at least virtually.  Enhanced connectivity of the end-users should be achieved in a sustainable manner since the green transition in telecoms is inevitable. One of the significant turnarounds of this green transition is the Connectivity Recommendation. It allows BEREC and the National Regulatory Authorities together with other competent authorities, such as RSPG, to be involved in the establishment of the Connectivity Toolbox."	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8072-5g-is-a-significant-economic-growth-driver

The co-legislators have entrusted BEREC to establish and the EU Agency for Support for BEREC to maintain the database. For this purpose, Member States shall transmit the relevant information to BEREC. The EECC made a step towards harmonisation, but many details remain in national competence. In this respect, BEREC is required to constantly monitor each Member State's implementation status to be able to establish the database and keep it up to date. Information regarding the number ranges with a right of extraterritorial use within the European Union or European Economic Area is organised in records. In the database, among other, there is information on country codes, number ranges, maximum and minimum number lengths. There are also links to the general rules or relevant conditions for the Member States in the database. Moreover, the database also contains information on the number ranges with a right of extraterritorial use only in European Union and European Economic Area. The European Electronic Communications Code foresees that the numbering resources database will enable an extraterritorial use of non-geographic numbers within the EU to provide non-interpersonal communications services.   The ‘extra-territorial use of numbers’ refers to the use of a particular country’s numbering resources by a foreign service provider in its home country. Hence, this term does not refer to permanent roaming situations. Whilst ‘non-interpersonal communications services’ encompasses different types of services. They include mobile internet access services, machine-to-machine/Internet of Things services and other services within an M2M/IoT context, such as communication with autonomous devices (e.g. remote setting of devices, etc.).	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/8032-the-new-numbering-resources-database-available-on-the-berec-website

The International Institute of Communications (IIC) organized a virtual discussion within the video series – IN CONVERSATION. During the informal discussion between two leaders, the incoming BEREC Chair emphasized the role of connectivity during the pandemics and in the future, highlighting the BEREC achievements in monitoring the potential network congestions during the past nine months. Michel Van Bellinghen said: “The period of pandemics was also an important test for our net neutrality regulation. In Europe, the operators are authorized to apply to exception traffic management measures to prevent congestion with an important condition – the equivalent categories of traffic shall be treated equally.” The FCC Chairman Ajit Pai mentioned the so-called “Keep Americans connected” pledge to ensure private-public partnerships during pandemics for the benefit of end-users. During the discussion, both speakers agreed that BEREC plays a vital role in pushing for fibre connectivity in Europe. Michel Van Bellighen explained that for the switch-off from copper to fibre, investments are crucial. Therefore, the regulatory and legal certainty can help to attract investors. Regarding the upcoming wireless plans, the incoming BEREC Chair shortly described the European situation in terms of coordination in 5G spectrum bands and security issues. The speakers concluded the discussion with the exchange of thoughts on the regulatory philosophy and how the public interest definition has changed. During this part of the talk, the European initiative to regulate digital platform was addressed. Mr. Pai also focused on whether there should be an American federal privacy law.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/7896-a-better-connectivity-for-a-better-future-agrees-berec-and-fcc-within-the-discussion

The event, the 3rd annual Baltic Sea Region 5G Ecosystem Forum, which is considered to be the leading 5G Forum in Europe, took place on 11-12 November 2020 online.The theme of this year’s Forum was the first year of 5G. In his keynote speech, devoted to giving BEREC’s perspective on 5G Deployment and Innovation, Dan Sjöblom spoke about 5G from a competition perspective as an alternative for fibre and a driver for innovation. BEREC Chair highlighted the BEREC’s contribution to the 5G deployment, providing as the examples the 5G Radar Report to be adopted by the end of this year at the forth BEREC Plenary 10-11th of December. He mentioned the report on the impact of 5G on regulation and the role of regulation in enabling the 5G ecosystem, adopted in the end of last year.  It was the first assessment based on stakeholder input. This report is the result of a “horizon scanning exercise”. It poses a range of questions, for example, how services might be rolled out, how markets might develop, and how any of these might raise new regulatory challenges for National Regulatory Authorities. He said that the new regulatory challenges do not mean more regulation per se; it could also mean more proportionate or less regulation, depending on the issue at hand. Dan Sjöblom also touched upon the review of the Broadband Reduction Cost Directive, outlining the BEREC’s significant role in its review. Stakeholders are invited to share their experience with the BEREC experts to contribute to obtaining an effective EU measure in this regard. He also described BEREC’s involvement in the EU work on cyber security and the 5G toolbox.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/7768-more-proportionate-or-less-regulation-berec-chair-outlines-the-contribution-to-the-5g-development-in-eu

At his keynote speech, the BEREC Chair said that the challenges that need to be addressed range from work on standards, interoperability, new business models, spectrum availability and network sharing, coverage, Quality of Service (QoS), security and resilience. During the virtual event, the BEREC Chair also emphasized that the fixed and wireless networks are essential infrastructure in Europe, even more so in times of crises. Therefore the misinformation about electromagnetic fields(EMF) and 5G may act as a barrier to the timely rollout of 5G networks. To address these challenges, Dan Sjöblom referred to a joint BEREC and Radio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG) statement, where both strongly support measures to protect the public and workers from harmful effects arising from exposure to EMF. Sjöblom also mentioned the BEREC commitment towards the network capacity during the pandemics. In March 2020, BEREC set up a special reporting mechanism to ensure regular monitoring of the Internet traffic situation in each EU Member State to be able to respond swiftly to capacity issues. Turn ON5G is the II National 5G Forum, which aims to bring together the best specialists in the 5G ecosystem. In its second edition, the event placed a particular emphasis on the economic reactivation after the Covid-19 crisis, reviewing the status of implementation and analyzing the first commercial experiences.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/7738-berec-chair-dan-sjoblom-highlights-the-5g-challenges-during-the-pandemics

The Body of Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) has asked the national regulatory authorities to indicate the overall status on internet capacity in their respective countries by using a traffic light system. 25 NRAs have responded to the request, all indicating that networks are continuing to work well in October - ‘status green’. No major network congestions were observed in October. In some countries, the data traffic demand across networks was trending higher, but thanks to measures taken by operators, there is sufficient capacity to meet demand. The updated BEREC summary report also informs about the new tracing. On 19 October 2020, the EU interoperability gateway went live to exploit the full potential of contact tracing and warning apps across borders and save lives. Using the new European gateway, the Austrian, German, Irish and Italian national contact tracing apps can now exchange contact-tracing data with each other. Apps of the other Member States, which also use a decentralized approach, are likely to follow.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/7733-berec-introduces-new-overview-on-the-status-of-networks-across-europe

It means prioritising work that improves the general conditions for the expansion and take-up of secure, competitive and reliable high-capacity networks across Europe while ensuring a smooth transition from legacy infrastructures. In his speech, the incoming BEREC Chair emphasised that crucial policy objective is to ensure that very high capacity networks and 5G services are available on time and in line with European values and interests - security, protection of the end-user and environmental challenges.  During the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, BEREC showed outstanding commitment in various areas such as monitoring internet openness and regulatory issues in general, supporting the European Commission on technical features of the tracing apps. Referring to the current situation worldwide, Michel Van Bellinghen assured, that BEREC will thoroughly analyse the experience gained during the COVID-19 crisis and will continue its effort further in the future.   ""One of the most pressing issues that the pandemic has shown regulators and policymakers is the importance of addressing the EU's digital divide. In that respect, the work done by the WIFI4EU program in collaboration with WBA to bring broadband to public spaces has and will continue to relieve some of these connectivity gaps,"" said the incoming BEREC Chair. Michel Van Bellinghen invited to seize this historic opportunity to come together to use new regulatory approaches to improve access to and the use of digital technologies for all its citizens, as this is the key for fighting pandemics. To achieve it, more efforts shall be put into strengthening connectivity and investments.  In his speech, Michel Van Bellinghen also touched upon the Digital Services Act – the new rulebook for the digital platforms. He called it as a game-changer for Europe and the rest of the world, as the main challenge relating to the digital transformation will be the need for more profound cooperation between regulators, on a national and a European scale."	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/7716-at-the-wireless-global-congress-the-incoming-berec-chair-invites-to-improve-access-to-and-the-use-of-digital-technologies-for-all-its-citizens

BEREC emphasizes that this is a clear, practical and transparent approach. BEREC also supports the termination rates and the implementation methods suggested in the DDA and agrees that under certain conditions, the termination rates for calls incoming from third countries should be bound by the maximum Union wide fixed and mobile termination rates.   In the mean-time, BEREC notes that in some cases, the current termination rates which are referenced in the DDA and the Staff Working Document (SWD) are outdated. In BEREC Opinion, it is indispensable that the EC considers the latest known rates for all Member States before the Delegated Act comes into force.   BEREC also highlights that non-price remedies could still be necessary, in many cases, to ensure effective competition in markets downstream of the termination markets. By setting maximum Europe-wide termination rates, the DDA is only addressing possible pricing abuses of an SMP position.   According to the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC), the EC shall adopt a Delegated Act setting the Union-wide voice termination rates by 31 December 2020.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/7680-berec-submits-its-opinion-on-draft-delegated-act-setting-the-union-wide-voice-termination-rates
BEREC_UNK_0053	7682	2020-10-16	UNK	BEREC adopts its Opinion on the draft EC Recommendations on relevant product and service markets susceptible to ex-ante regulation	BEREC adopts its Opinion on the draft EC Recommendations on relevant product and service markets susceptible to ex-ante regulation 16 October 2020 Tweet Today, 16 October 2020, the Board of Regulators has adopted the BEREC Opinion on the draft European Commission’s (EC) Recommendation on relevant product and service markets susceptible to ex-ante regulation. As stated in the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC), the EC shall adopt a new revised Recommendation by December 2020. The Commission shall take utmost account of the opinion of BEREC. In its Opinion, BEREC addresses the removal from the list of termination markets 1&2/2014 and of market 3b/2014, as well as the new markets 1/2020 and 2/2020, the potential new market for wholesale access to physical infrastructure and the transitional issues. Concerning the termination markets 1&2/2014, BEREC is not opposed to the removal of these markets from the relevant markets. However, concerns remain about the possible implications of this removal. Therefore, BEREC asks for an explicit acknowledgement in the text of the Recommendation of a situation, which could lead many NRAs - due to national circumstances - to continue applying SMP regulation in the termination markets. BEREC recognises and appreciates that the EC acknowledges the possibility for NRAs to also address the non-price related issues through Article 61 of EECC. In this regard, to both highlight the importance of this issue and to ensure regulatory certainty, BEREC asks the EC to specify in the text of the Recommendation itself that addressing relevant competition issues in the termination markets could be one of the justifications for applying Article 61(2) EECC. As a forward-looking analysis shows that high and non-transitory entry barriers will be observed in the majority of Member States, BEREC agrees with the EC on the importance of maintaining market 1/2020 in the list of relevant markets. BEREC also is with the same opinion with the EC on the need for a geographical analysis, which can lead to more targeted regulation of this wholesale market.  In the document, BEREC highlights the need for a case-by-case analysis regarding the substitution between local and central wholesale access and also notes that there is not a general trend for national cable footprints. BEREC believes that the EC’s view regarding the Union-wide competitiveness of the wholesale central access (WCA) market (former market 3b/2014) is premature and does not reflect the current and foreseeable future developments in the majority of Member States. BEREC is of the view that a more proportionate regulatory approach would be to engage in a detailed geographic analysis of the WCA market, which, depending on the national circumstances, could lead to a geographic segmentation of markets or remedies and to a regulatory intervention limited to specific sub-national geographic markets where the three criteria test is met. BEREC agrees with the EC that former market 4/2014, now market 2/2020 should be maintained in the list of relevant markets. Among other issues, BEREC also considers business-grade bitstream services may be part of the product market and suggests to maintain the definition of this market as a “high-quality wholesale access” market. On mobile backhaul, BEREC considers that that there is a need for regulated services in some countries, especially in the light of the expected deployment of 5G networks. BEREC also stresses the need to take into account the specificities of multi-site demand when dealing with both product and geographical market segmentation, when applicable. Regarding the potential new market for wholesale access to physical infrastructure, BEREC agrees on the approach taken by the EC and welcomes the detailed guidance provided in the Draft Explanatory Note. It will be useful for those NRAs considering, now or in the future, whether this market should be regulated separately. Finally, BEREC also raises a suggestion concerning the use of geographic surveys of networks in geographic market definitions to align recital 36 in the Draft Recommendation with Article 22 EECC. BEREC looks forward continuing its collaboration with the EC throughout the review process until the Recommendation finally comes into force.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/7682-berec-adopts-its-opinion-on-the-draft-ec-recommendations-on-relevant-product-and-service-markets-susceptible-to-ex-ante-regulation

BEREC seeks interested stakeholders (e.g. operators, associations, equipment vendors, towerCOs, municipalities) to present their views in relation infrastructure sharing in the context of 5G. The concept of stakeholder presentations is part of BEREC’s ongoing approach to improve stakeholder engagement.  By addressing some of the questions, it is intended that stakeholders provide targeted presentations referring to practical examples to support their views (c.5-7mins followed by short discussions with experts). The audience for presentations is the BEREC WNE WG.  Essentially, the experts will collect and discuss the content in the context of the 2019 Common Position.  The outcome of the workshop will be to draft potential next steps (if any) that may need to be taken to update the 2019 Common Position. Please express your interest to present by sending email with your contact details to pm@berec.europa.eu by 30 October 2020. Afterwards you will be contacted individually. Mobile infrastructure sharing is important to many stakeholders including BEREC.  BEREC’s current thinking on the subject is set out in document BoR(19) 110 (the “2019 Common Position”), which was based on document BoR(18) 116 (the “2018 Report”).  Essentially, the 2019 Common Position identifies and describes factors to be considered by NRAs when assessing an infrastructure sharing agreement, where they have competence to do so.   More recently, BEREC has issued preliminary views on the impact of regulation on 5G and the role of regulation in enabling the 5G ecosystem (document BoR(19) 245). In addition, BEREC initiated a public consultation on the BEREC 5G Radar (document BoR (20) 110).  In line with BEREC’s Work Programme 2020, and within this broad context, BEREC’s Wireless Network Evolution Working Group (“WNE WG”) is looking to collect information about possible future evolutions of the 2019 Common Position. In particular, the WNE WG is interested in understanding the reasons, if any, as to why, how, where, and when BEREC might wish to update its views on the issue of mobile infrastructure sharing as a result of 5G.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/7671-berec-invites-stakeholders-to-express-interest-in-presenting-their-views-at-the-virtual-workshop-on-mobile-infrastructure-sharing

Commenting on the joint paper, developed by RSPG and BEREC, Dan Sjöblom, BEREC Chair 2020, noted that “wireless connectivity is a cornerstone of our everyday lives.  The development of the fifth-generation (5G) technology standard for cellular networks, will be a game changer for the European economy and society: it will lay the ground not only for faster speeds but also for a plethora of new advanced use cases (transport and health being examples of them). At the same time, its beamforming capabilities together with the use of new frequency bands stimulated the discussion on the potential effects of electromagnetic fields exposure on human health anew.” Frank Krüger, current chair of the RSPG, a high-level advisory group to the commission on spectrum policy, said that “5G is the most important evolution of wireless broadband in the near future. The commercial launch of 5G has already started in many Member States. RSPG will further monitor the state of play of 5G awards and authorisations regarding the 5G pioneer bands and carry on to engage in the sharing of information and experience in support of a successful roll-out of 5G in the EU, including questions related to the measurement of EMF-limits.” The joint paper represents a precursor to future work for BEREC, recognising that, together with other competent authorities (health, environmental, radiation protection), it is important to remain open to hearing and understanding such concerns of European citizens. BEREC will, within its competence, continue to address potential barriers to wireless deployments. For example, in 2021 BEREC intends to continue to work on how best to communicate science-based EMF exposure limits recommended by experts, under its strategic pillar of promoting full connectivity. BEREC’s draft Work Programme 2021 is also open for consultation until 5 November 2020 (17:00 CET). The RSPG provides a platform to share experiences on planned or completed awards as the main precondition for the 5G deployment. It thus gives national regulators the opportunity to discuss the full range of issues linked to those authorisations, including, but not limited to, the connectivity, efficiency and efficacy of award procedures. BEREC and RSPG will continue to cooperate and exchange views on issues of mutual interest.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/7667-berec-and-rspg-adopt-joint-position-paper-on-spectrum-related-emf-issues

In his keynote speech, the BEREC Chair Dan Sjöblom invited the regulators to seize this historic opportunity to come together to use new regulatory approaches to accelerate the inclusive growth of ICTs. The BEREC Chair, who also is serving as the GSR-20 Chair, emphasized, that “the improving the access and use of digital technologies is now, perhaps more than ever, key for the achievement of global goals, such as fighting pandemics and reaching other global goals such as the Sustainable Development Goals.” Special attention was paid to the role of national regulatory authorities in shaping an enabling environment for the development of digital connectivity for all. The BEREC Vice–Chair Jeremy Godfrey introduced the participants with the regional trends and stressed that connectivity has saved lives by allowing people to work, shop and school from home during lockdown. He acknowledged the good job that the telecoms industry has done by ensuring that there was sufficient coverage and capacity to keep people connected as well as the proactive measures some took to increase end users data allowances, zero-rating traffic to health and educational websites and working with their customers to agree financial solutions for those in difficulty. Mr Godfrey outlined the role that BEREC played during the initial phase of the pandemic in Europe by gathering and publishing information from NRAs across all European member states regarding the evolution of internet traffic as well as measures taken by governments, regulators and operators in the ICT sector to mitigate the effects of Covid. Mr Godfrey noted that the pandemic has shown that there still is a digital divide and it will be important to ensure that those people in rural areas gain access to adequate broadband as much as those that already have adequate broadband gain access to the latest very high capacity networks. He went on to highlight the role that BEREC has to ensure the consistent application of the provisions of the new European Electronic Communications Code, which will come into effect in December this year and which contains several pro-investment measures, including wholesale-only and co-investment models. These provisions, along with end-user provisions such as independent comparison tools enabling the comparison and evaluation of different internet access services and publicly available communications services mean that BEREC has been working hard on providing guidelines on how these provisions should operate in practice, which will assist NRAs and provide regulatory certainty to industry players.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/7436-cooperation-between-stakeholders-the-key-principle-to-drive-the-development-of-the-digital-sphere-says-berec-chair-at-the-gsr-20-discussion

It shows that no major congestion issues occurred. In light of the fixed and mobile network traffic situation stabilizing, some NRAs have reduced the regularity of collecting the data on a weekly basis, however, operators are still obliged to report in case of drastic changes to the network traffic. As in many European countries the confinement measures are eased, some NRAs have informed on rescheduling the interrupted spectrum auctions. For example, in Austria the spectrum 700 MHz, 1500 MHz and 2.1 GHz bands auctions will resume for the second half of August. Finland will start the spectrum auction for 26 GHz band in the beginning of June as planned. With the increase of disinformation on the possible connection between the mobile technologies and the COVID-19, some countries reported on the attacks against telecommunications facilities. In order to disperse the false information an information campaigns to raise awareness on mobile technologies are taking place.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/7185-the-overall-internet-traffic-in-europe-continues-to-stabilize-says-the-berec-summary-report

However, due to the absence of legal competences for authorities under the previous Regulatory Framework, this impact has never been quantified.     To identify the metrics and indicators national regulatory authorities may collect, BEREC plans to organise a workshop on a harmonized OTT data collection at the end of 2020 and, consequently, to prepare a report in 2021.   The initial step for further work is information gathering on different OTT parameters. BEREC has prepared two separate questionnaires addressed to providers of interpersonal communications service over the public internet and to providers of video-streaming services. With this information gathering, BEREC aims to understand from providers, what is the information collected internally and, what are the definitions and methods used for such an assessment. BEREC invites the mentioned providers to request access to the questionnaires via email: pm@berec.europa.eu.    To gather a wider scope of opinions on the OTT parameters, BEREC extends the deadline to respond to the questionnaires. The providers of the interpersonal communications services are kindly invited to submit their responses to the questionnaires by 26 May 2020 and, the video-streaming services providers by 29 May 2020.

Instead, more and more countries report on stabilization in an overall traffic, according to the latest BEREC summary report on the internet capacity during the COVID-19 outbreak. This report summarises the main findings of the ongoing, twice-weekly information gathering exercise and includes the most recent data provided to BEREC by its constituent national regulatory authorities (NRAs) as of 14 April 2020. 31 NRAs have shared information about the impact of the crisis on the internet service providers (ISPs) networks and the actions taken so far. With the view to ease the situation due to the outbreak of COVID-19, particular steps will be taken in several EU Member States for the benefit of end-users. For example, in Portugal the professionals of the national health service dealing with COVID-19 patients will receive “communication benefits” such as 10 000 voice minutes for national fixed and mobile networks, 10 000 SMS for national mobile networks and 10GB of data. In Poland, the operators have increased the data caps, as well as extended the deadlines to pay invoices for elderly.    Apart from the periodical reporting, the ISPs are requested to immediately notify the NRAs about any exceptional measure put in place. This is particularly relevant for the application of any exceptional traffic management measure.  Pursuant to the Open Internet Regulation, the operators may apply exceptional traffic management measures to prevent impending network congestion and to mitigate the effects of exceptional or temporary network congestion, always under the condition that equivalent categories of traffic are treated equally. The next status update is due on Friday 17 April and can be found on BEREC website.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/6945-internet-capacity-remains-sufficient-says-the-updated-berec-summary-report

In the past, BEREC contributed to the development of the new Electronic Communications Code (EECC) with its expertise gained in almost ten years. Now, the Code is about to be published and in the near future BEREC will help to implement it in the Member States consistently. Gungl noted that some rules in the Code are completely new and therefore have to be interpreted without drawing on jurisdiction or earlier decisions or Commission guidance. Thus, there is little experience on that which adds uncertainty in the first place. In the upcoming two years, BEREC will issue eleven Guidelines to help implementing the EECC. For Gungl, they will be important in turning the Code provisions into useful tools: “We will be engaging with the industry as we develop them and hopefully we will answer as many questions as possible to provide certainty and predictability. I am very confident that the implementation and the application of the new rules will be consistent across Europe as we have shown on the Net Neutrality Regulation.”	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/5228-eecc-berec-will-provide-certainty-and-predictability

Now, the India Mobile Congress 2018 invited Mr Gungl as an Honoured Guest and Special Speaker to New Delhi. The BEREC chair seizes the chance thankfully to exchange with stakeholders not only from Asia. Especially, he can do so as a speaker in both panels “The Evolving Regulatory Landscape in the New Digital Ecosystem - Regulatory Brief” and “Pro-Innovation Regulation and Privacy- Encouraging New Digital Business Models”. The international congress showcases solutions in leading technology domains such as 5G, IoT, Artificial Intelligence, FinTech and encourages both bilateral discussions and knowledge sharing. Johannes Gungl’s participation at the India Mobile Congress 2018 blends in wonderfully with the international ambitions of BEREC. In June this year, BEREC signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Indian Regulatory Authority TRAI. Additionally this year, MoU with the Canadian CRTC and the American FCC were signed to strengthen international cooperation and exchange as foreseen in BEREC’s Work Programme 2018.

This shows in public consultations and in the annual Stakeholder Forum. Yesterday, 17 October, the telecoms and digital communications sector gathered for the 6th time to interact with BEREC. They were able to put forward their thoughts on the draft BEREC Work Programme 2019, BEREC’s effectiveness and stakeholder engagement, as well as efficient investment in European telecoms.       “BEREC already started with groundwork for the implementation of the new European Electronic Communications Code,” said BEREC Chair Johannes Gungl in its opening remarks and mentioned examples such as the “BEREC Report on the location of the network termination point” and the “Draft BEREC Report on contractual simplification”. The implementation of the Code (EECC) and the new BEREC Regulation will be central in the BEREC Work Programme 2019 and 2020. Also central will be the further development of BEREC. Johannes Gungl said: “We want to invite you to give feedback to us and we will listen. We want to intensify the dialogue with all different types of stakeholders and we want to get better.” Jeremy Godfrey, BEREC Chair 2019, then presented next year’s draft Work Programme. “Our industry is changing fast, so the new Code is totally necessary,” he said. BEREC will drive harmonization in Europe by issuing several Guidelines and Opinions to implement the EECC smoothly. “The BEREC Work Programme 2019 will also bring longer term planning,” Jeremy Godfrey said. “It will give the stakeholders more time to respond to public consultations.” This aim absolutely reflected the Stakeholders needs, as an interactive quick survey in the audience revealed. Seeking input from stakeholders earlier in projects, e.g. via early calls for input or workshops, found the audience the most effective way of optimising stakeholder engagement. Two panels and discussions gave the stakeholders chance to share their points of view. In the first one named “BEREC Effectiveness & Stakeholder Engagement”, BEREC tried to generate ideas for the Board of Regulators to reflect on, so that it can boost its duties under the new EECC. Panel two talked about efficient investments in the European telecoms sector. The purpose of this session was to explore the complex interplay between efficient investment, promotion of competition and consumer benefits. “Investments in high capacity networks is what the European Commission wants,” said Director General of DG Connect, Roberto Viola in his contribution from the European Commission. “And with the new Code we enter a new era in co-investments.” Closing the 6th BEREC Stakeholder Forum, Co-Chair Jeremy Godfrey announced a new record of participating Stakeholders. A copy of the live stream of the 6th BEREC Stakeholder Forum 2018 is available online.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/5173-recap-of-the-6th-berec-stakeholder-forum-2018

The BEREC Chair Johannes Gungl took part to the panel session on the “Ministerial interview: Access, fairness and competitiveness”. The panel discussed the move to 5G and fibre, trying to answer questions on the connectivity challenges. It also touched upon the impact of the Net Neutrality regulation on the 5G roll-out. Mr Gungl explained that BEREC had a clear goal in 2018 – to find out, if there are any hurdles for a swift roll-out of 5G in Europe in the context of the Net Neutrality rules. “According to our findings, there is no evidence for it on table. We haven’t seen any use case so far which wouldn’t be possible under the existing rules. Therefore, we think that the current Net Neutrality framework is flexible enough for 5G,” he confirmed. At the panel session on “Dialogue: 2020 Vision - The next generation” focusing on challenges and opportunities to be faced after the elections next year as well as new political objectives, pro-privacy initiatives and desired technology prowess, fast technological change and globalization, the Incoming BEREC Chair Mr Godfrey underlined the opportunity for Europe to become a leader in trust, saying that there is a lack of trust in big tech and a lack of trust in non-liberal democracies. Chaired by the Financial Times (FT), and organised in association with European Telecommunications Network Operators' Association (ETNO), the Summit gathered together leading policymakers, regulators, industry executives and investors from Europe and beyond to discuss and debate progress towards harmonized technology media and telecoms rules, and Europe’s role in an ever more connected world.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/5168-current-nn-framework-is-flexible-enough-for-5g-berec-chair-at-the-ft-etno-summit-2018

The telecommunication sector is no exception, especially given its growing interactions with other sectors that are at the core of data economy – online platforms, audio-visual content providers, sensors collecting data, and others. BEREC considers that it is important to study implications derived from data economy. For example, BEREC wants to find out, how the data economy will affect the market of electronic communications services and identify potential bottlenecks. Also of interests are leverage of market power and conglomerate effects, other potential competition issues derived from the use of data as well as opportunities and risks for consumers.   BEREC is fully committed in enhancing transparency and participation to its activities, and therefore encourages all stakeholders to submit their contributions via the BEREC online public consultation platform which will be available together with the traditional email submission.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/5160-berec-launches-four-public-consultations-to-run-until-7-and-21-november

This Public Debriefing by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications was held in Brussels, Belgium. Gungl put emphasise on the important work BEREC conducts to facilitate a fast and smooth deployment of 5G in Europe. An illustrated document introduced five key documents to contribute to this goal. All five of them are planned to be published this year, whereas two of them were already presented during this Public Debriefing. 5G and Mobile: Minimising costs, mutual understanding and engagement There are clear benefits to achieving a common understanding of how to monitor mobile coverage. The BEREC Common Position on Monitoring Mobile Coverage will facilitate a mutual understanding and foster a consistent approach on how this information can be made available and understandable throughout Europe. “To enhance the outcome of this Common Position, we really want to hear the stakeholder’s opinion on the technical specifications and common thresholds for monitoring mobile coverage in Europe. Therefore, we kindly invite them to participate in the public consultation starting today”, said Gungl. The second document presented was a Report on Infrastructure Sharing. “5G is based on small cells, meaning more base stations are needed for it to work properly. To help minimise the cost and boost the speed of 5G deployment, BEREC gathered information on infrastructure sharing across Europe”, explained Gungl. Market and Economic Analysis: Estimating price effects of mergers The European telecommunications market shows tendencies for more concentration, which has effects on the work of the national regulatory authorities (NRAs). Therefore, a Report on Mergers and Acquisitions by BEREC contributes to the literature on the estimation of post-merger price effects of three mergers in the European mobile market: Hutchison/Orange merger in Austria (2013); Hutchison/Telefónica (brands: 3 and O2) merger in Ireland (2014); Telefónica/KPN (brands: O2 and E-Plus) merger in Germany (2014). “Bedsides the effects of mergers and acquisitions on prices, this report also provides some evidence on effect on Quality of Service for Austria and Germany”, underlines Gungl. Next Generation Network: Descriptive analysis In order to get a deeper insight into “Layer 2 Wholesale Access Products” and to contribute to consistent access products as well as to foster the knowledge transfer between NRAs, Gungl presented a Report on the L2 WAP / advanced bitstream offers for undertakings (M4).

This year from 9th to 13th April, the BEREC Chair for 2018 Mr Johannes Gungl (RTR), and Vice-Chairs Mr Sébastien Soriano (ARCEP), Jeremy Godfrey (COMREG), Mr Dan Sjöblom (PTS), Mr George Michaelides (OCECPR) and Mr Vladica Tintor (RATEL), accompanied by Ms Elisabeth Dornetshumer (RTR) and Ms Anne Lenfant (ARCEP) travelled to Canada to meet institutional and industrial stakeholders. The meetings were held in Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa. They covered several topics that are of interest for BEREC and the evolution of the digital environment in Canada. The delegation discussed with the local NRA (CRTC), the ministry responsible for spectrum issues (ISED), operators and with organizations in the digital environment. The main topics were 5G, net neutrality and how to incentive investment and broadband deployment. The study trip was an occasion of the BEREC Chair and Vice-Chairs to engage in discussion with the Canadian Counterpart CRTC and to build a relationship for further cooperation. On their way home, the delegation made a stop in Washington, to visit the colleagues of the FCC, the FTC and the NTIA to discuss with them latest issues on spectrum and 5G. BEREC was also interested in an update on the latest net neutrality discussions in the US. BEREC will publish a report on the findings of the study trip soon.                                            Photos:  (above left) Meeting with CRTC - George Michaelides (OCECPR), Vladica Tintor (RATEL), Claude Doucet (CRTC), Jeremy Godfrey (COMREG), Dan Sjöblom (PTS), Sébastien Soriano (ARCEP), Ian Scott (CRTC), Dre Caroline J.

BEREC_UNK_0146	4810	2018-03-14	UNK	5G, International Roaming and Net Neutrality: BEREC holds a debriefing on important documents for the European Electronic Communications Market	5G, International Roaming and Net Neutrality: BEREC holds a debriefing on important documents for the European Electronic Communications Market 14 March 2018 Tweet Today a public debriefing was held by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) in Brussels, Belgium. BEREC Chair 2018, Johannes Gungl, presented the outcomes of the 34th BEREC Plenary Meetings. In his introduction he highlighted the focus areas for 2018 – displayed visually in the latest BEREC video. He laid special emphasis on a study on 5G, the latest data on International Roaming and a consultation paper regarding Net Neutrality.     Enabling 5G: Implications of deployment and future business models BEREC has made 5G a strategic priority for the next three years. It underlines this fact with a study commissioned by BEREC and conducted by DotEcon and Axon. From today, this 5G study is available for download on BEREC’s website. Gungl explained: “The goal is to contribute to the removal of potential hurdles for a smooth deployment of 5G in Europe.” With this said the study shows that the realisation of 5G use cases will be a step-by-step process. Many potential use cases are currently at very early stages of development. In order to better understand current and future network security issues BEREC held a workshop on 5G and “Internet of Things”. It was organized in cooperation with the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA). Latest data: RLAH significantly contributes to the single market BEREC, for the first time, is presenting data on the impact of „Roam Like At Home“ (RLAH). It shows the effects on the markets in terms of volumes, revenues and wholesale rates. The report reveals a substantial increase of data volumes in the EEA. Data volumes increased by 435% in the period from Q3 2016 to Q3 2017. The average consumption per month per subscriber in the EEA in Q3 2017 was 242 MB. Less significant is the increase of volumes in voice and SMS services. The report shows that the number of minutes of calls made per month per roaming customer increased from 8.8 minutes in Q3 2016 to 14.23 minutes in Q3 2017. “Although international roaming services demonstrate high seasonality, the results clearly indicate that the 2015 amendment of the Roaming Regulation has significantly contributed to the development of the single market”, Gungl said. Stakeholder Engagement: Evaluating the Net Neutrality Rules Best practice learning among the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and stakeholder engagement are crucial parts of BEREC’s work. So this plenary meeting was used to discuss ongoing Net Neutrality cases. This is vital for a consistent application of the rules across the EU. Now again, BEREC is reaching out to all its stakeholders via public consultation. This time the aim is to collect information for BEREC’s input to the Commission’s Evaluation of the Net Neutrality Regulation. The consultation paper consists of a series of open questions to the stakeholders on definitions, zero-rating practices, traffic management, specialised services, transparency and new technologies. Of special interest to BEREC is how stakeholders view Net Neutrality Rules in the context of 5G. The public consultation is envisaged to run from 14 March 2018 until 25 April 2018. Contributions are encouraged through the BEREC online public consultation platform. The results will be prepared for Plenary 4 2018, in December, for adoption for publication and as formal input to the European Commission. Regulatory framework review: BEREC’s expertise on Intra-EU Calls and its view on the Peer Review process BEREC recently published a preliminary analysis on the matter of intra-European Union (intra-EU) calls with a view to feeding the ongoing discussions on the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC). It will continue the analysis and will come up with additional analyses by the end of April. Regarding the Peer Review process, BEREC recently learnt that due to the outcome of the latest trilogue discussions it will not have a formal role in the peer review on award procedures. BEREC Chair Johannes Gungl says: “I regret this development and would like to reiterate that National Regulatory Authorities have and should have an important role on market shaping aspects of spectrum management.” According to Gungl it is important to acknowledge that both, BEREC, with its role in the functioning of the electronic communications markets, and the Radio Spectrum Policy Group, concerned with spectrum management in general, have a part to play based on their respective areas of expertise. A full list of public documents adopted at the plenary meetings is available on the BEREC website. The next BEREC plenary meetings will be held in Gdańsk-Sopot, Poland on 13-15 June 2018. A video recording from this public debriefing is available on the BEREC YouTube channel.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/4810-5g-international-roaming-and-net-neutrality-berec-holds-a-debriefing-on-important-documents-for-the-european-electronic-communications-market

During the event the draft BEREC study “Implications of 5G deployment and future business models” was presented to the participants of the workshop. The document is going to be approved by the Board of Regulators during its plenary meeting on 8 March and later published on the BEREC website. BEREC has made 5G a strategic priority for the next three years. The aim is to enable European scale solutions to help reap the benefits of early and coherent implementation of 5G: innovation, productivity and growth in the internal market. The European regulators within their scope of competence actively follow the development of 5G. It is done in order to contribute to the removal of potential hurdles to a smooth implementation of high-speed internet in the Member States. BEREC workshop was jointly organized with the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA).	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/4800-berec-organizes-an-internal-workshop-on-5g-iot-and-security

Being the 5G enabler in Europe, BEREC Chair Johannes Gungl engages with all the stakeholders at the congress: ""It is definitely an opportunity to listen to and to learn from each other. I think we all have similar challenges ahead like spectrum availability, speed of network roll-out or creating sufficient demand. So the dialogue is crucial for all of us."" For the take up of demand it is also crucial to have more and more convincing use cases. Thus, Gungl discusses the business cases of telecom operators for 5G: ""I expect to get a clearer picture about where the opportunities are lying for the telcos. It will be up to the regulators to do their part in order to help enabling these business cases."" The GSMA Mobile World Congress is a yearly four-day event in Barcelona, Spain.

An expert panel amongst Gungl discussed a roadmap for 5G and the delivery of a European Gigabit Society. BEREC, within the scope of its competence in 2018, actively and closely follows the development of 5G. It wants to contribute to the removal of potential hurdles to a smooth and quick implementation of 5G in the Member States. For Gungl it is not acceptable that building a mobile site takes 18 to 24 months due to permission and negotiation issues. “We want to give the industry the investment certainty it needs for a fast and consistent deployment of 5G in the Member States”, he said. With this aim BEREC is also supporting the EU Action Plan for 5G. The European 5G Conference 2018 took place on 12 and 13 February in Brussels and was focused on the connectivity, use cases and deployment models. It brought together high-level stakeholders for the discussion on the roadmap ahead in the continuous journey towards the Gigabit Society. *Frontpage photo by Forum Europe	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/4763-eliminating-hurdles-for-a-quick-roll-out-of-5g

The main topics discussed were related to the BEREC Chair’s priorities in 2018, ongoing regulatory debate on the European Electronic Communication Code (EECC) and implementation of Net Neutrality in Europe, including ongoing work on connectivity and questions on access regulation. J.Gungl outlined that the top priority for BEREC this year is 5G: “We have many topics to work on, but all designed to identify and eliminate hurdles to fast 5G deployment and if existing practices are adequate for 5G”. He also confirmed the supportive role BEREC has to give technical advice in the process of the ongoing regulatory debate on the EECC if requested and that BEREC is “ready to stand up if we see things move in the wrong direction”. It was the 7th edition of the regulatory summit – a platform for up to 200 high-level delegates, representing telecom operators, the EU institutions, regulators, academics, investors and other industry stakeholders, to discuss key EU regulatory issues. This year the focus was on regulation in 2018, a new access doctrine, business models, 5G, technological convergence and industry collaboration and spectrum policy.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/4758-5g-is-our-top-priority-this-year-says-berec-chair-at-the-etno-mlex-regulatory-summit-2018
BEREC_UNK_0152	4734	2018-01-10	UNK	BEREC and RSPG present solutions to facilitate mobile connectivity in challenge areas	BEREC and RSPG present solutions to facilitate mobile connectivity in challenge areas 10 January 2018 Tweet While the EU’s goal for 2020 is to ensure that all Europeans should have access to Internet speeds above 30 Mbit/s and at least 50% or more of European households subscribed to internet access above 100 Mbit/s, many countries still face difficulties meeting the increasing demand from users and local authorities for a mobile connectivity available in rural areas and in constrained areas (indoor locations, subways, tunnels, hot spots…). In line with its aim to enhance connectivity and innovation in Europe and in order to get a clearer picture of the situation in Europe regarding this issue, BEREC has adopted a common report with RSPG on facilitating mobile connectivity in “challenge areas”. This report first describes the main issues encountered to provide mobile connectivity in some ‘challenge areas’ where mobile connectivity is limited or non-existent. The report describes four categories of challenge areas: indoor, transportation means, non-profitable areas and other areas (such as protected areas, “grey” areas and low quality of service areas). It mainly compiles initiatives to facilitate mobile connectivity for each of these areas in Europe. The report presents various solutions such as developing network sharing, installing repeaters, Wi-Fi or imposing coverage obligations, depending on the issue at stake. Examples of limitations or drawbacks identified with some of these solutions or initiatives presented are discussed in the report. The report was published for publication consultation on 11 October until 8 November. The final report takes into account comments raised during this consultation. In 2018, BEREC will further work on mobile coverage issues in the context of 5G roll-out. BEREC will thus publish two best practices reports on spectrum authorization/award procedures and coverage obligations with a view to considering their suitability for 5G; and will also publish, after public consultation, two common positions on infrastructure sharing and monitoring of mobile coverage. The RSPG will be associated to this work.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/4734-berec-and-rspg-present-solutions-to-facilitate-mobile-connectivity-in-challenge-areas

In his keynote speech, BEREC Chair Sébastien Soriano highlighted that, to boost connectivity, Europe needs investments and that, to this end, the whole sector has to work together to ensure the investments needed are there. He stressed it is therefore important not to oppose the different actors of the sector; everyone is needed, entrepreneurs, alternative operators, incumbents, to meet the connectivity challenge. This challenge calls also for BEREC and regulators to help investors confront the new investment cliff that is marking the telecom sector: “Our job is not only to ensure competition anymore. Our new job is to accompany the telecom sector through the investment cycles of today and tomorrow”. In this regard, Mr Soriano acknowledged that a stable framework is of utmost importance in order to ensure predictability to operators and therefore facilitate investments.  In addition, BEREC Chair Mr Soriano and Incoming Chair Mr Gungl emphasized that 5G and connectivity are strategic priorities for BEREC in the coming years with the aim to enable European-scale solutions. “It is our goal to help reap the benefits of an early roll-out of 5G in Europe. BEREC will actively and closely follow the development and will work to identify and eliminate potential hurdles to a smooth deployment of 5G,” said Mr Gungl. BEREC Incoming Chair J. Gungl also stressed the importance of an independent BEREC and national regulatory authorities both from the industry and the governments to provide regulatory predictability and support long-term investment and innovation. “With significant investment ahead, transparency, continuity, predictability and consistency in an ever harmonized environment are more important than ever for the sector,” he said and underlined that the potential for such harmonization depends on the national regulators having a common set of competences to ensure a productive exchange at European level. In his speech, the Incoming Chair has also highlighted the ongoing work on net neutrality implementation. “All national regulators gathered in BEREC are well aware of the fact that the execution of the net neutrality rules in a consistent way across Europe is of utmost importance,” emphasized J.Gungl. On 7-8 December in Copenhagen at the last plenary meetings of the year, BEREC will discuss major net neutrality cases from different countries. On 13 December 2017, from 10.30-12.00 (CET) in Brussels, BEREC will hold a public debriefing to discuss, among other topics, net neutrality issues in light of the report presenting one year of implementation of net neutrality Regulation and related BEREC Guidelines. It will be live-streamed on the front page of www.berec.europa.eu.

It particularly focuses on regulatory and legal measures that have been adopted to resolve that issue. The draft report describes four categories of challenge areas: indoor, transportation means, non-profitable areas and other areas (protected areas, “grey” areas, low quality of service areas). For each type of challenge areas, the draft report describes the difficulties encountered in the identified challenge areas and describes different technical, regulatory or legal solutions and practices that have been implemented or considered by EU member states. BEREC and RSPG would like to get feedback from stakeholders on their draft joint report and thus launch a public consultation that will run from 31 October until 28 November. BEREC also invites all stakeholders to participate in the other ongoing public consultations, running until 8 November on the report analysing the impact of content and devices on the telecoms market, the preliminary report on monitoring of mobile coverage in view of a Common position and the BEREC Work programme for 2018. Do not miss the deadline to submit your contributions! BEREC values very much the views of all stakeholders, and expresses its appreciation and gratefulness for the time, resources and efforts that will be spent for this activity. As BEREC is fully committed in enhancing transparency and participation to its activities, all stakeholders are encouraged to submit contributions via online public consultation tool, available together with the traditional email submission.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/4618-berec-rspg-joint-report-on-facilitating-mobile-connectivity-in-challenge-areas-berec-and-rspg-seek-your-views-ends-28-november-2017

The objective of this study is to examine the approach taken by NRAs in selected non-European benchmark countries (Chile, India and USA) to address net-neutrality issues. The results of this study are now available and show many interesting takeaways for BEREC Work on this topic, bearing in mind that these different approaches reflect specific legal frameworks and market situations. Approaches to tackling net neutrality in selected countries The report shows that Quality of service (QoS) clearly has an impact on net neutrality. Regulators in the markets analysed are actively monitoring QoS, but have chosen to rely on a range of different methods to monitor net neutrality. For instance, the important role of the complaint systems in the USA and Chile in particular means that enforcement in these two countries has a primarily ex-post character (in contrast to the EU, where Regulation 2015/2120 requires NRAs to monitor proactively, on an ex-ante basis). Moreover, in some regulatory regimes, existing mechanisms and powers to deal with anti-competitive behaviour are preferred to tackle non-neutral practices, which provide regulators with future discretion. Third-party organisations can also provide useful complements to the NRAs, in terms of expertise and capacity building in measurement systems suitable for the detection of certain types of net-neutrality violations. In the end, the report demonstrates that many different tools are available to detect practices which may violate net neutrality (either ex ante or ex post), although no single tool would be able to provide a comprehensive solution. Given the obligation in the EU/EEA upon NRAs to actively monitor non-neutral practices themselves, multiple tools or methods are likely to be required, thus calling for the development of a toolkit that can grow over time as new risks are identified and as new forms of abuse are encountered. Case studies The study also presents four case studies from the selected countries.  Although none of the benchmark countries has tools and techniques which have been specifically designed for monitoring non- neutral practices, the case studies illustrate monitoring approaches which may be of use to European NRAs as they develop their approach for addressing net neutrality. Takeaways for BEREC This study will contribute to an informed public debate and constitute a valuable source of practical information for European NRAs and BEREC while implementing EU regulation 2015/2120. The study will also help BEREC and European NRAs to define their options for addressing net-neutrality issues and identify the requirements and challenges they may face in future.

This year’s edition will be devoted to many new challenges regulators face in a fast – changing environment. Investment in very high capacity networks being key in this new environment, the forum will thus be the occasion to further question the way investments and competition could be both incentivized without conflicting under the new access framework proposed by the Commission. The forum will also be dedicated to the question of how regulators can act to protect consumers’ rights as well as to foster innovation in this fast-changing environment.   The draft BEREC Work Programme for 2018 will be presented during the event. A public consultation on the Work Programme will be launched on that day and all stakeholders will be invited to contribute via BEREC online public consultation tool. The Forum is fully open to public but is subject to prior registration.  As there are a limited number of seats for the event, registration will be on a first come, first served basis. Live web streaming, with sign interpretation, will be provided on the BEREC website on the day of the event. Citizens and other interested parties will have an opportunity to watch it in real time and send comments or questions to the speakers through the official BEREC account on Twitter by using #BERECforum. The BEREC Stakeholder Forum was established in 2013 and aims at providing direct interactive platform for discussion between BEREC and actors of the digital and telecoms sectors.

[…] It is now to national regulators and BEREC to make sure that these rules are properly and consistently implemented over Europe” emphasized BEREC Chair for 2017 Sebastien Soriano (Arcep) at the “Digital-born Media Carnival” in Kotor, Montenegro on 17 July. The event was organised to gather hundreds of online media representatives, information explorers and digital rights enthusiasts to discuss the future challenges to freedom of expression and media professionalism in a connected public sphere. At the panel discussion “Promises and Perils of Net neutrality”, BEREC Chair Sebastien Soriano explained the benefits and challenges Europe is facing after adopting the rules on net neutrality. In his intervention, the BEREC Chair listed the actions National Regulatory Authorities can take in order to enforce the implementation of the rules (e.g. monitoring of the market, gathering information from internet service providers (ISPs) and customer complaint platforms and realizing measurements to detect traffic management practices). Such actions also include the NRAs’ capacity to undertake coercive actions (e.g. by requiring ISPs to deal with degradation of Internet Access Services (IAS), ceasing or revising problematic traffic management practices, ceasing provision of specialised services in certain limited cases and ultimately they can impose fines on ISPs whose practices infringe the Regulation). Sebastien Soriano again stressed that BEREC’s action is not just a matter of paperwork. It provides solutions, consistency and legal certainty. BEREC, as the umbrella organisation for enforcers of European Net neutrality rules, has a specific role to make net neutrality implementation a great success in Europe and safeguard an open environment for everyone: consumers, businesses and citizens.

BEREC_UNK_0162	4422	2017-06-19	UNK	BEREC publishes its response to the Commission’s Public Consultation on the Review of the SMP Guidelines 	BEREC publishes its response to the Commission’s Public Consultation on the Review of the SMP Guidelines 19 June 2017 Tweet BEREC welcomes the opportunity to provide an input to the Public Consultation on the Review of the “Commission guidelines on market analysis and the assessment of significant market power under the Community regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services” (“SMP Guidelines”), which has been launched on March 27th. The main messages included in the BEREC response are the following: - BEREC regrets that the review of the SMP Guidelines is conducted in parallel with the Framework Review, and not consecutively. Indeed, the current review of the Guidelines relies on the existing Framework, meaning that the possible evolution of the Framework will not necessarily be taken into account in this Guidelines Review - BEREC remarks that, in line with previous reports as well as on-going discussion on the new Code, there is a need to address competition issues derived from “tight oligopolies” - In addition, BEREC's response is mainly focused on requesting guidance on collective dominance. The evolution of electronic communication services markets from single SMP to oligopolistic structures makes the issue of identifying joint dominance more urgent. Yet, past experiences showed that NRAs have had problems when trying to identify joint dominance. All the specific issues addressed in BEREC responses were previously raised in its reports apart from a request of general guidance on addressing convergent markets and especially bundling practices that are becoming more relevant. This contribution is not to be considered as an exhaustive list of issues as BEREC may raise additional issues when providing its opinion on the draft of the new guidelines, and does not pre-empt the orientation of the BEREC Opinion that will be then provided.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/4422-berec-publishes-its-response-to-the-commissions-public-consultation-on-the-review-of-the-smp-guidelines

During the session, he outlined that BEREC and National Regulatory Authorities have a very technical and specific work in front of them to ensure that roaming like at home is a sustainable reality as we experience it today: “National Regulators in every country have to control the retail offers of operators to make sure they are respecting the roam like at home principle. We are also looking at the very limited number possible exceptions under the defined conditions. And we can also fix possible disputes between operators in the system.” When asked about the link between regulation and the global competitiveness of European operators, he pointed out that, while Europe has been lagging behind during the last 15 years in the field of smartphone production and digital platforms, it has now a part to play: “Today all the tech giants are in Asia or in US. So it is important to make sure that we have tech giants in Europe. In the telecoms sectors, it could be through the internet of things. It is a new wave of innovation. So, on this particular subject, we have to make sure that we are not over regulating.” In that regard, he referred to the forward-looking assessment of the current regulation conducted by BEREC and concluding that there is no need for a specific regulation for the internet of things. Mr Soriano believes it is an opportunity for start-ups to grow and for Europe to be back on track.   The Digital Assembly 2017, is an opportunity for stakeholders to debate, take stock and look ahead at how Europe and how its partners around the world are preparing for this digital transformation. It is also an opportunity to have a dialogue on the benefits of the Digital Union for citizens with a special focus on the younger generations.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/4427-our-role-is-to-ensure-that-roam-like-at-home-is-not-wishful-thinking-but-the-reality
BEREC_UNK_0164	4402	2017-06-09	UNK	BEREC adopts Guidelines on Wholesale Roaming	BEREC adopts Guidelines on Wholesale Roaming 09 June 2017 Tweet Wholesale Roaming Guidelines concern the wholesale roaming access obligations for mobile network operators and the rights for access seekers on the application of Article 3 of Regulation 531/2012. In the document BEREC provides guidance to the NRAs, which are required to take the utmost account of it in resolving any disputes or taking any enforcement action concerning Article 3. According to the mentioned Article, mobile network operators must meet all reasonable requests for wholesale roaming access, comprising of direct wholesale roaming access and wholesale roaming resale access. The new Guidelines replaces the BEREC Guidelines of 2012 (BoR (12) 107), the revision of which was necessary to include the changes of the amended Roaming Regulation. According to Article 3 (1) Roaming Regulation, mobile network operators (MNOs) shall meet all reasonable requests for wholesale roaming access, comprising of direct wholesale roaming access and wholesale roaming resale access. Direct access means that the retail provider contracts directly with a foreign EEA visited network for the purpose of allowing roaming customers to access the roaming services of the retail provider. It is worth noting that “direct” access is not necessarily physical. The concept also includes the possibility of a direct charging agreement between retailer and visited network operator, in conjunction with physical access negotiated with a host MNO. Resale access means that the retail provider bases its retail service on the wholesale service provided by an MNO usually, but not necessarily, in the end user’s home country. As from 1 July 2012, the roaming access agreements have fallen within the scope of Article 3 and its later amendments and request for other variants of direct or resale access must be met, provided only that they are reasonable, irrespective of whether the access seeker is an MNO, MVNO or reseller without systems. The Guidelines apply to “regulated” roaming services, as defined in the Regulation. Except where the Regulation explicitly applies to other services, the Regulation applies immediately to EU Member States. The Roaming Regulation also applies to the EEA EFTA states Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The amended obligations in Regulation (EU) 2017/920 will also apply when they are incorporated in the EEA agreement.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/4402-berec-adopts-guidelines-on-wholesale-roaming

This year the discussion will focus on the most significant aspects of connectivity and will be articulated around the following topics: Connectivity: investments in ultra-high capacity networks and bridging the digital gap; Mobile connectivity: spectrum issues; Rights in a connected world: net neutrality challenges. At the end of the Summit, a Joint Declaration will be adopted, which will be published on the BEREC website after the meeting. The Summit is a valuable opportunity to enhance the regulatory dialogue between the European NRAs and the counterparts from the Middle East and North Africa, Latin America and the Eastern European countries. The Summit will be kindly hosted by the Portuguese National Regulatory Authority – Autoridade Nacional de Comunicações (ANACOM). BEREC International cooperation In 2017, BEREC continues to develop and strengthen the contacts with regional regulatory networks such as EMERG, EaPeReg and Regulatel, in accordance with the BEREC Regulation and in cooperation with the EU external action services. Every year, it becomes ever more necessary for BEREC to engage in dialogue with NRAs based outside the EU, as well as with a variety of regulatory networks, policy-makers and institutions involved in electronic communications matters. The increasing volume of electronic communications flowing in and out of the EU and the globalisation of the telecommunications industry (similar to another industries) means that policies, legislation and regulations have to be seen from beyond the European perspective and take into account the global perspective. Therefore, BEREC is closely following international trends in technology and changing business models, so that to retain the capacity to address challenges swiftly and effectively as they arise.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/4355-berec-4-lateral-summit-connecting-regions-ensuring-connectivity-in-convergent-world

This year, the BEREC delegation, composed of BEREC Chair and Vice-Chairs visited India from 29 March until 5 April. The objective was in particular to meet with key stakeholders of the dynamic Indian digital ecosystem. On this occasion, the BEREC Chair and Vice-Chairs had a meeting with the Indian Regulatory Authority (TRAI).  Net neutrality, IT and digital ecosystem were among the most important topics to discuss between the BEREC delegation and TRAI. BEREC Chair Sebastien Soriano (Arcep) took this opportunity to emphasise that European regulators followed with great interest the Indian regulator’s move to ban Free Basics. He also expressed BEREC’s interest in the Indian industry’s dynamism, notably the impact of Reliance Jio on the market, the cost-sharing model through tower companies and the digital enabler Aadhaar.  This meeting was the occasion for BEREC Chair and Vice-Chairs to engage in a discussion with their Indian counterpart to find the points where they have a common understanding about net neutrality. “India is the most important democracy in the world; Europe is the second one. So, as net neutrality is a democratic issue, it’s really important that the most important democracies stick together to see if we are considering this the same way.”  In this regard, BEREC Chair informed the Indian regulator that BEREC intends to dedicate an important part of its work to net neutrality this year. In particular, a BEREC report on implementation of the net neutrality rules in the EU is to be issued this year. It is also envisaged that, in 2017, BEREC experts will elaborate a tool kit for quality of service measurements BEREC Chair interview in an Indian newspaper.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/4311-berec-seeks-common-understanding-on-net-neutrality-with-india

From 15 June 2017 onwards roaming providers should not levy any additional surcharge to the domestic retail price on roaming customers in any Member State for any regulated roaming service subject to a Fair Use Policy (FUP). The BEREC Guidelines are designed to explain the Roaming Regulation (at retail level) including the Commission Implementing Regulation laying down detailed rules on the application of a “fair use policy”, the methodology for assessing the sustainability of the abolition of retail roaming surcharges and on the application to be submitted by a roaming provider for the purposes of that assessment. These Guidelines replace the BEREC Guidelines published in 2016 (BoR (16) 34) dealing mainly with the transitional period. These Guidelines are complementary to the provisions set out in the Roaming Regulation and the Commission Implementing Regulation, and are not presented as an official legal interpretation of those provisions. NRAs are to take these BEREC Guidelines into utmost account when supervising the Roaming Regulation in their Member States.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/4302-berec-adopts-guidelines-on-regulation-eu-no-5312012-retail-roaming-guidelines

Three documents were adopted at the 30th plenary meetings: the draft BEREC Medium-term Strategy 2018-2020 consultation document, an updated survey on Universal Service provisions, and a summary report of the workshop on IoT technologies, held on February 1st in Brussels. BEREC Medium-term Strategy 2018-2020: involving stakeholders at an early stage with first open public consultation During the Plenary meetings, a consultation document on the BEREC Medium-term Strategy 2018-2020 was adopted. The current Medium-term Strategy covers the period 2015-2017 and is reviewed periodically. For the review of the current strategy, BEREC foresees a two-step process of stakeholder engagement, to meet the request expressed by stakeholders to be involved in BEREC’s work at an early stage. The first step is a consultation on broad and open questions to stakeholders on major market developments and how BEREC improves its dialogue with stakeholders. This consultation was launched on 8 March at the first BEREC public debriefing of 2017 and will take advantage of the new online public consultation tool which was recently deployed by the BEREC Office. After collecting the various inputs, the draft Medium-Term Strategy for 2018-2020 will be completed and a second public consultation will be conducted after the 31st BEREC plenary meetings in June. This review exercise, and the process followed, highlights BEREC’s commitment this year to bringing more agility and transparency to regulation as well as to enhance engagement with stakeholders. Universal Service provisions: contributing to the debate at EU level and updating to new uses BEREC has also adopted the BEREC update survey on the implementation and application of the Universal Service provisions. The document is a synthesis of the main results on the implementation and application of Universal Service provisions and is an update of the 2014 internal report. It is based on 31 answers from 27 EU member states as well as from 4 non EU member states. The document covers issues such as the designation of Universal Service Providers, assessment of net costs, compensation mechanisms, assessment of unfair burden and measures NRAs have implemented on the affordability aspect of universal service obligations, such as retail price caps. This work shall contribute to the reflections on the evolution of Universal Service in Europe. Workshop on IoT technologies (1 February): summary report, presentations and videos available on BEREC website Finally, the Board of Regulators adopted a summary report on the outcomes of the Workshop on IoT technologies that took place on 1 February in Brussels, as a follow up document to the workshop itself. In line with BEREC’s engagement to contribute to the enhancement of connectivity and innovation in Europe as well as to bringing more agility to regulation, the workshop was the occasion for stakeholders to discuss the regulatory implications and solutions that might be required to ensure a large-scale and sustainable IoT roll-out that delivers significant benefits to citizens and users across several industry sectors. All presentations and videos from the workshop are publicly available on the BEREC website. BEREC commitments in 2017 and next steps This year, BEREC intends to contribute to enhancing connectivity in Europe, especially through an important workstream on mobile issues. BEREC is also committed to safeguarding an open environment, in a constant dialogue with stakeholders. The implementation of net neutrality rules is an important step and BEREC will prepare several reports on this topic. Enlarging the discussion, the impact of devices and contents on telecom markets will also be analysed by BEREC. Bringing agility to regulation is another long-term goal for BEREC and the promotion of transparency tools will be part of it. BEREC will also play an important part in the review of the regulatory framework that will open new perspectives for regulators. A full list of documents adopted at the plenary meetings is on BEREC website. The next BEREC plenary meetings will be held in Cascais, Portugal on 1-2 June 2017.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/4282-outcomes-of-the-30th-berec-plenary-meetings-paris-france-on-23-24-february-2017

He also took part in several meetings with manufacturers and met with the new FCC Chairman, Mr Ajit Pai. On several occasions, Mr Soriano had the opportunity to express BEREC views on the ongoing review of the regulatory framework and to share BEREC’s commitment to facilitate the implementation of European digital policy, especially the Gigabit society, 5G, Internet of Things, and entry of new digital players. As such, policymakers and the industry can count on BEREC when it comes to ensuring the existence of competition as a driver for investment. Mr Soriano considered it a “nonsense” to oppose regulation and connectivity; the challenge being to adapt the regulatory toolbox to clear objectives set by the European legislators. He also insisted on the track record of BEREC to deliver as an independent body relying on the expertise of its members. On spectrum, the BEREC Chair welcomed the Commission’s proposal to harmonize NRAs’ competencies on market shaping aspects of spectrum management. Public authorities, including NRAs have the duty to ensure that connectivity and competition will be optimal in the future. He also warned that a futureproof framework cannot accommodate itself with 25 years individual rights over spectrum chunks that will be decisive for the whole society. Looking back at the great changes the mobile industry has gone through over the last 20 years, he recalled that innovation is such that no one can predict what will be the needs of the sector in 25 years’ time. To support future innovations, including new models and new entries, the framework will need both agility and certainty, which is not the case in the current proposal. Finally, the BEREC Chair emphasized that networks are a common good and defended the necessity for entrepreneurs and end-users to benefit from an open access to the internet. In this regard he insisted on the need, not only to pursue the transatlantic dialogue built between BEREC and the FCC, but also to enlarge the discussion to interested regulators around the world.

BEREC_UNK_0176	4225	2017-01-27	UNK	BEREC Workshop: Preparing the revolution for the Internet of Things	BEREC Workshop: Preparing the revolution for the Internet of Things 27 January 2017 Tweet On 1 February 2017, BEREC will hold an expert Workshop on the Internet of Things (IoT) in Brussels, with live streaming on the BEREC website (www.berec.europa.eu). Dedicated to the topic “Enabling the Internet of Things”, the event will bring together experts and stakeholders to discuss the regulatory implications and solutions required to ensure a large-scale and sustainable IoT roll-out, in order to deliver significant benefits to citizens and consumers across different industries. While telecom-specific topics (such as scarce resources and interoperability) will certainly be tackled, the Workshop will also consider broader issues pertaining to innovation and investment, consumer rights and data privacy. The first session of the Workshop will focus on privacy, network security and consumers’ rights, while the second session will focus on diversity of business models and interoperability. The topic of scarce resources (numbers and frequencies) will be dealt with in session 3, and in session 4 IoT industry use cases relating to energy and transportation will be presented. Opening remarks will be given by the BEREC Chair 2017 Sebastien Soriano, and Dr Wilhelm Eschweiler, BEREC Chair 2016, will close the workshop. More details on the event are available in the Agenda. Ongoing work on IoT The Workshop is a follow-up to BEREC’s February 2016 report on “Enabling the Internet of Things”, which assessed whether, and to what extent, existing telecoms rules (primarily construed for voice telephony) are also a fit for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. In light of the European Commission’s review of the telecoms framework, BEREC considers that, in general, no special treatment of IoT services and/or M2M communication is necessary, except for roaming, switching and number portability. With regard to privacy, BEREC sees the need for a careful evolution, though not a complete overhaul, of the existing EU data protection rules. This assessment does not preclude that within the European Commission’s review, further areas for amendments of the telecoms framework, taking into account the peculiarities of the Internet of Things services and/or M2M, might be identified. Dialogue with authorities and stakeholders With this workshop, BEREC provides a forum for dialogue between national regulatory authorities and authorities which are competent for other matters regarding the IoT as well as with other stakeholders in the industry in order to create awareness and foster both an innovation- and consumer-friendly environment. Further information The Workshop will be live streamed on the BEREC website (www.berec.europa.eu) from 9:00 till 17:30 (CET) and a video of the event will be available on the BEREC YouTube channel afterwards.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/4225-berec-workshop-preparing-the-revolution-for-the-internet-of-things

Soon after the publication of the European strategy for a Gigabit society and the legislative proposals for the telecoms review, this was one of the first major opportunities to discuss them at European level. During his speech at the panel discussion dedicated to analyse how pro-investment is the EC proposal, the BEREC Chair reiterated that evidence shows that in fact competition is the best driver for investment: market entrants have been challenging incumbent operators by rolling out their own infrastructure based on access regulation following the ladder of investment concept. So only a competitive environment can incentivize investment activities by the market players. Wilhelm Eschweiler underlined the importance to avoid any risk of eroding and undermining the principles of the SMP regime in outbalancing the current clear “rule and exception” relationship. Regarding any proposed preferential regulatory treatment of instruments such as “commercial agreements” and “co-investment” for the sake of fostering connectivity, the BEREC Chair urged for a rather cautious approach carefully weighting the pros and cons. BEREC is currently assessing the proposals by the EC in detail, but tentatively has some doubts on a number of proposed measures in its current form.  He also stressed, that there is a need to maintain the flexibility for NRA’s to respond to national circumstances with flexible regulatory toolbox to enable “tailor-made” solutions to achieve the connectivity aim.

The European Commission wants to ensure everyone in the European Union (EU) is having the best possible internet connection in order to fully participate in the digital economy and society. With the legislative proposals the European Commission aims to place the EU at the forefront of internet connectivity. The BEREC Chair reassured that BEREC is supportive of the aims set out in the legislative proposal establishing the Electronic Communications Code and that BEREC shares the European Commission’s objectives around high speed connectivity goals, ultra-fast broadband and 5G deployment. He also confirmed that BEREC welcomes the European Commission’s  Communication “Towards European Gigabit Society”. But at the same time the BEREC Chair underlined the neecessity to preserve the successful approach of the current framework that has been ensuring promotion of competition and infrastructural investment as well as high level end-user protection. in addition, Mr. Eschweiler outlined the further steps BEREC is going to take in the following months. He reminded that BEREC has already published an opinion on the telecoms review at the end of last year. In light of the now tabled legislative package BEREC will undertake a thorough examination of the European Commission’s proposals and evaluate the future directions proposed: firstly, through a BEREC opinion delivering high level messages by the end of this year and, secondly, an extensive in-depth analysis of the European Commission’s legislative proposals on an article-by-article basis in 2017. During his presentation the BEREC Chair mainly focused on two substantial issues at the heart of the legislative proposals: access regulation and institutional set up. The Digital Assembly 2016 took place on 28 and 29 September in Bratislava, Slovakia, co-organised by the European Commission and the Slovak Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The event featured two plenary sessions and six workshops to discuss some of the key topics of the Digital Single Market strategy.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/4072-berec-chair-preliminary-berec-views-on-the-ec-proposal-for-telecoms-review

During his speech the incoming BEREC Chair stressed the great importance of investments in the telecoms sector: “In order to boost connectivity, investment in the telecom sector — fixed and mobile — will be key”. But he insisted on the fact that regulation is not the enemy of investment as claimed by many operators:  opening telecom markets to competition has been, for the last two decades, essentially a matter of how to open and secure investment opportunities that should be open to all, not only to people in the place. As a key message, Mr Soriano stressed that investment should remain a priority, if not a necessity, to the operators. “I strongly believe in entrepreneurship as the essential driver of the digital revolution,” underlined Mr Soriano. “I consider risk taking and innovation — of all kinds — as fundamental pillars to build tomorrow’s networks. And this is certainly what made the opening of the telecom markets in Europe such a success.” Chaired by the Financial Times, and organised in association with ETNO (European Telecommunications Network Operators' Association), the Summit gathered together leading policymakers, regulators, industry executives and investors from Europe and beyond to discuss and debate the direction of sector reform (of its telecoms and digital laws) proposals, and their impact on the role of telecoms in the rapidly developing communications space.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/4067-invest-or-die-sebastien-soriano-message-at-ft-etno-summit-2016

In particular, Mr. Eschweiler participated as a speaker in the panel discussions regarding “Tomorrow’s Internet of Things (IoT)” on 23 June 2016 where he discussed the OECD report on IoT and highlighted the main messages of the BEREC Report on “Enabling the Internet of Things”. “Since connectivity is an essential part of, and a precondition for, the Internet of Things, it is vital that regulatory frameworks concerning telecommunication are fit for purpose”, the BEREC Chair emphasized. Depending on national circumstances, regulatory telecom frameworks might need a ”refreshment” in order to create an environment where IoT services can thrive and which fosters innovation and competition. Therefore, legislators should consider reviewing their telecom laws in order to adjust them if appropriate. In this line, the BEREC Report on “Enabling the Internet of Things” examines if and where adjustments to the EU regulatory telecom framework might be required. The BEREC Chair also pointed out that, from a regulator’s perspective, in particular the automotive industry and the energy industry are areas where the Internet of Things is becoming more and more important. For both types of IoT services – connected cars and smart meters – usually mobile connectivity and SIM cards are used. BEREC and national regulatory authorities in the European Union are in close dialogue in particular with these industries as well as network operators in order to remove existing barriers and to enable corresponding business models.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/3875-berec-participation-at-the-oecd-ministerial-meeting-on-the-digital-economy-innovation-growth-and-social-prosperity-in-cancun-mexico

In this context, every year, BEREC organises an international mission to a country outside the EU in order to garner insights regarding the country’s electronic communications market main activities, to exchange views regarding business models and to promote bilateral relations. This year, between 22 and 28 May, a BEREC delegation visited the United States (Boston, New York and Washington, D.C.) and held several meetings with organisations and companies related to the electronic communication and information technology sector, namely with universities, regulatory authorities, policy makers, content providers, electronic communications providers, start-ups, think tanks and investment funds. The purpose of this mission included the discussion of topics such as different regulatory models in Europe and the United States, future business models and investment perspectives, Internet of Things, open standards, (ultra)broadband or 5G. BEREC delegation was composed by the following NRA Heads: Wilhelm Eschweiler (BNetzA/Germany), BEREC Chair, Fátima Barros (ANACOM/Portugal), BEREC Vice-Chair, Sébastien Soriano (ARCEP/France), BEREC Vice-Chair, Angelo Cardani (AGCOM/Italy), BEREC Vice-Chair, Henk Don (ACM/The Netherlands), BEREC Vice-Chair and Ömer Fatih Sayan (BTK/Turkey), IRG Vice-Chair.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/3846-berec-international-mission-to-the-usa-2016

The focus of the discussion was on the priorities of the Framework Review, the tools for a future-oriented regulation and the possible evolution of the sectoral institutional governance. In relation to the connectivity goal stressed by the European Commission, the BEREC representative, clarifying that BEREC is not a policy maker, expressed though the Body’s support for such objective, as well as for the relevant cross-sectoral measures envisaged by the Digital Single Market Strategy and, with specific reference to access regulation, expressed the need to guarantee stability in the ex-ante approach as well as the necessary flexibility in the NRAs’ toolbox. During the discussion, the BEREC representative referred to how regulation could further help achieve the policy objectives enshrined in the current framework – competition, internal market, end-users’ interests – and underlined their enduring validity with a view to ensuring continuity to the investors. “In order for the entire system to work, it is fundamental for NRAs to have a common remit,” he pointed out and, in this respect, he referred to BEREC’s appreciation for the European Parliament’s first reading resolution relating to the TSM proposals, suggesting a standardisation of the NRAs’ institutional tasks. The event brought together more than 200 high-level delegates, representing telecom operators, the EU institutions, regulators, academics, investors and other industry stakeholders, to discuss key EU regulatory issues as a new set of rules for the European telecom sector is about to be presented by the European Commission to provide the regulation of the field for the next decade.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/3763-etno-mlex-regulatory-summit-discussion-on-future-oriented-eu-laws

He expressed some views on the review of the regulatory framework for electronic communications in Europe from the perspective of BEREC. During his presentation the BEREC Chair pointed out that more than thirteen years after its inception the regulatory framework needs to be adjusted to current market dynamics, developments and changing consumer needs. With a forward looking approach the framework needs to be flexible enough to cope with a fast changing digital ecosystem. He underlined that the review process provides a good opportunity to “re-fresh” the regulatory framework while preserving what is at the root of its success – its underlying principles. “BEREC’s view, balanced set of objectives – promotion of competition and investment, Internal European market and end-user interests – is still valid and fit for purpose.” Mr. Eschweiler also reflected on some key substantial of the framework review process. He underpinned that first of all the framework review is part of a wider Digital Single Market strategy by the European Commission. Secondly, from BEREC’s regulatory perspective the “holistic approach” taken by the European Commission makes perfectly sense as digitalisation and evolving technological developments impact a wide array of areas. At the same time it is important to ensure a consistent and coherent approach between various initiatives and to be realistic enough to take into account that regulation on its own doesn’t solve all problems or meet all challenges around the Digital Single Market. The BEREC Chair concluded his presentation by confirming that BEREC is ready to take up its role and to provide input based on its expertise as previously done. Various current BEREC workstreams are focusing on key telecoms review issues, among them major topics being at the heart of the review: access regulation and stemming issues around oligopolies; crucial role of spectrum for the roll-out future networks in an increasing IoT world; and over-the-top (OTT) services debate.	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/3724-berec-views-on-the-review-of-the-telecoms-framework-in-europe

New opportunities for growth and innovation are emerging in Europe, and it is crucial that the new regulatory requirements and challenges are anticipated and addressed at both national and European Union level, in a coordinated way. The evolution of the Internet and Internet-driven services like the presence of Content and Application Providers, the Internet of Things and Machine to Machine, Cloud Services and Cloud Computing, mean that some services will increasingly become available independent from location, device or platform. 	Additionally, consumers will demand hyper connectivity, superfast broadband, wide coverage, high-quality experience, and service ubiquity. Therefore, to make the most of the European digital economy, it is necessary to break down existing barriers, and use a holistic approach to promote the required cross-sectoral measures. The Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe presented by the European Commission last May, goes in this direction and identifies the key role of telecommunications and the importance of appropriate regulation. BEREC, the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications, will closely cooperate with the Commission in the Digital Single Market implementation and is already looking into possible areas of adjustment to the current electronic communications legislative framework. 	The main regulatory challenges are related to the fair treatment of players on new and cross-sectorial markets, demand take-up, and the promotion of competition as the main driver for investment in new infrastructures. In order to meet the long term connectivity needs of the European Union, exploit innovation and capitalize on the new digital economy, European regulators will need to have an active role and regulate and deregulate as and when needed."	https://berec.europa.eu/eng/news_and_publications/whats_new/3231-to-make-the-most-of-the-european-digital-economy-it-is-necessary-to-break-down-existing-barriers-berec-chair-at-the-contel-conference

The workshop will serve as a valuable input to BEREC’s update to its Report on Equivalent Access and Choice for Disabled End Users and BEREC will continue to follow the issues raised during the event. 	The workshop focused on four main issues: 	a)      The accessibility and usability challenges faced by disabled end-users when accessing electronic communications services; 	b)      The contribution of regulators to improving accessibility for disabled citizens; 	c)       Accessibility considered from the industry perspective; 	d)      Designing for all - A manufacturers and service providers’ challenge. 	The event was opened by the BEREC Chair (Prof. Fátima Barros) and there was active participation from around 70 representatives from regulators, manufacturers, disability associations, service providers, independent experts and from the European Commission. 	A number of recommendations and suggestions were made (directed to BEREC and to stakeholders) to improve policies and business practices and help promote equivalent access and choice for end-users with disabilities. These covered areas such as better monitoring, accessible information and better regulation. 	Regarding better monitoring, some participants suggested it would be important to benchmark relevant indicators for accessibility in communications markets; others were also in favour of collecting more detailed and more updated statistics across the EU; and participants looked forward to the update to BEREC’s Report on Equivalent Access and Choice for Disabled End-Users that is planned for the end of 2015. 	Concerning accessible information, particular emphasis was placed on the need for institutions and service providers to constantly improve the accessibility and usability of their websites; the value of accessible communications in helping to promote the inclusion of disabled citizens in the workplace was noted; and the importance of active engagement with disabled citizens and their representative organisations was highlighted, namely in order to gain more sensitivity and insight into disability issues and promote measures (e.g. consumer guides and comparison websites) that support better decision making by all end-users, in particular those with disabilities. 	As for better regulation, it was suggested that NRAs need to have a more regular and open dialogue with other public entities about disability issues; NRAs were recommended to strengthen their cooperation with disability associations, consumer associations and with the private sector; and participants also discussed issues around “universal design”, (industry-led) technical standardisation and the possibly of re-examining the provisions that operators make to serve disabled customers.

BEREC_UNK_0233	2821	2015-03-03	UNK	BEREC discussed the future of the sector in 5 years under the leadership of the BEREC Chair 2015 – Prof. Fátima Barros	"BEREC discussed the future of the sector in 5 years under the leadership of the BEREC Chair 2015 – Prof. Fátima Barros 03 March 2015 Tweet 	BEREC held its first Plenary meeting of the year in Bern, Switzerland, on 26 and 27 February 2015. 	The Plenary meeting was preceded by a public workshop, on 25 February 2015, to discuss the emergence of oligopolies in both fixed and mobile markets, and consider whether existing regulatory tools are adequate to address the potential for “collective dominance”. The workshop benefited from the active participation of stakeholders, as well as from NRAs from markets which have experienced recent market consolidation. More information about the workshop is available here. 	During the Plenary meeting BEREC members discussed the main challenges that the sector will face in the next five years, in an attempt to identify potential bottlenecks to be addressed by the next review of the EU regulatory framework. This was the first of a series of sessions for exchanging views with the European Commission aiming at supporting the Commission in its undertaking for the legislative review, in the context of the Digital Single Market (DSM). A number of high level key challenges were identified: in an all-digital society new competition bottlenecks may emerge and must be dealt with to protect consumer choice; ensuring all consumers available and affordable high-speed broadband must be addressed in rural and more sparsely populated areas; the framework must evolve to ensure consumers can engage with digital services with more and more confidence; despite the level and quality of broadband coverage in many regions, lack of demand remains a concern which has to be appropriately addressed. 	BEREC will hold a public workshop on equivalent access and choice for disabled end-users on 4 March in Brussels, which will inform the update of BEREC’s previous report on this issue. 	Finally, BEREC published its 14th benchmark report on roaming, under the Roaming III Regulation adopted in 2012. 	This was the first BEREC Plenary meeting under the chairmanship of Fátima Barros, President of the Portuguese Regulator, ANACOM.
