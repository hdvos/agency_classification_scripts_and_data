Many people seem to have switched from using trains to travelling by car in 2020 and 2021. As always in times of uncertainty, mathematical models based on available evidence can help to estimate the actual risks and add to more objectivity. That is why ERA develops in this study a first model to estimate the COVID-19 risk when travelling long-distance by train in order to provide the necessary knowledge that can be used by decision makers and the public. \u201cMost human beings, including decision makers, seem to have difficulty to estimate and manage risks [\u2026]When used correctly, the model can help to make the situation more tangible, yet controllable. However it is important to carefully take into account all assumptions, evidences and boundary conditions\u201d, says Torben Holvad, ERA\u2019s editor of the study. The study confirms that the overall fatality risk travelling by public transport is a multiple higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than in other times. However, individual car travel currently remains more dangerous than rail, taking into account the overall safety risk, also under the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context with vaccines being rapidly distributed, the overall picture is even clearer in terms of the ranking of overall fatality risk ranking between rail and car. Sensitivity testing, e.g. including more infectious new virus variants, has confirmed the robustness of the results that can be obtained by using the model. When safety measures are in place, like masks and distancing, cleaning and discouraging infected people to travel, the risk of being infected when travelling by train can be significantly reduced. \"During this pandemic the Agency is supporting the railway sector by giving technical advice, e.g. with the COVID-19 Rail Protocol and the COVID Ventilation Bulletin published in 2020 and it continues to closely monitor the situation in permanent contact with national authorities, the European Commission and its stakeholders\u201d, says Josef Doppelbauer, Executive Director of ERA. \u201cIn order to reach our climate goals and to avoid massive congestion problems when citizens continue to travel by car after the pandemic, it is essential to rebuild trust in railways and make rail the first choice.\"\u00a0This is the reason why ERA proposes a joint Post-Pandemic Rail Recovery Campaign, to be developed together with the European Commission and European sector organisations. In the European Year of Rail, this initiative would help to restore trust and promote both rail passenger and freight transport as currently the most sustainable mode of transport. About the EU Agency for Railways The European Union Agency for Railways was established in Valenciennes (offices) and Lille (meeting facilities) in 2004. Its 170 employees represent more than 22 European Member States and speak multiple languages. ERA has been providing EU Member States and the European Commission with technical assistance in the development and implementation of the Single European Railway Area. This comprises enhancing technical interoperability and harmonising rules, promoting simplified access for customers, developing a common approach to safety and safety culture, advising on telematics applications and ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System), monitoring National Safety Authorities and Notified Bodies and facilitating the exchange of information between the railway actors in Europe. Since 16th June 2019 the EU Agency for Railways is mandated to issue single safety certificates and vehicle (type) authorisations valid in multiple European countries and to ensure an interoperable European Rail Traffic Management System. The purpose of these activities is expressed by the slogan \u201cMaking the railway system work better for society.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.era.europa.eu/content/study-rail-travel-remains-safer-car-travel-even-during-pandemic_en"}, {"id": "ERA_NEWS_0013", "date": "2021-04-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Risk mitigation measures to resume transport of semi-trailers on pocket wagons in Denmark", "text": " Following the 13.01.2021 incident on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark, which happened at the same location as the severe accident of 02.01.2019, the Danish National Safety Authority imposed immediate measures which in practice have stopped the transport of semi-trailers on pocket wagons.

ERA presented the requirements structured in a Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycle and explained the overall safety assessment process, also supported by ERA guidance documents on safety certification: from the application submitted by railway companies, the role and task of assessors, and the assessment till the decision taken, including the conditions applicable for the renewal, modifications, restrictions or revocations of safety certificates.\u00a0 The French (EPSF) and Finnish (Traficom) national safety authorities reported on their experiences with issuing safety certificates and highlighted the benefits of the new EU legal regime, introduced under the 4th railway package. Specific attention had been given to the advantages of harmonised procedures, but also to the challenges posed by some requirements (e.g. \u00a0the integration of human and organisational factors or the development of a positive safety culture). The Ministry of Transport from Israel explained that a comparable safety certification scheme had been introduced in Isrel, and informed about the steps and processes used to certify, since 2018, the safety management system of its national railway operator, Israel Railways (ISR).\u00a0 On the second day, experts of ERA and national authorities described supervision as a key process to ensure the effective application of railway safety management systems, and pointed out the need for national safety authorities to design and implement a comprehensive strategy to supervise railway companies. The purpose of this strategy is to make sure railway companies effectively apply their safety management system provisions on a continuous basis during the period of validity of their safety certificates.\u00a0 To do so, ERA explained the way national safety authorities develop their strategies and implement subsequent plans addressing major railway risks, referring to some key principles such as proportionality, consistency, transparency, accountability, or cooperation to ensure sound and fair decision making. \u00a0 The Belgian national safety authority (SSICF/DVIS) provided an overview of the different supervision techniques used, from operational controls, on-site inspections to system audits, highlighting the need to go beyond compliance, and drive railway companies towards more efficiency and efficacy of their safety management systems.\u00a0 The Ministry of Transport from Tunisia reported on some of the tasks carried out to regulate safety, and to monitor the performance of its national operator, SNCFT, through indicators.

The report published today is based on data for the reporting period 2018, and where available, for 2019. This report provides a thorough overview of the development of railway safety and interoperability in the European Union. It should facilitate evidence-based policy-making at EU level. European railways remain among the safest in the world with one passenger fatality occurring each 25 billion kilometers on average. Major accidents with more than five fatalities are becoming increasingly rare, 2018 being the first year since the late 1980s with no major railway accident reported. ERA\u2019s Executive Director, Josef Doppelbauer however urges the sector: \u201dWe can never afford to be complacent. Unlike the European aviation and maritime industries, railways still have not implemented a systematic and comprehensive EU-wide safety occurrence reporting scheme, which would enable not only to learn effectively from major accidents, but also from incidents without victims. Several areas in which safety has been stagnating recently, such as level crossing and railway workers safety, or rolling stock fires, would particularly benefit from wider information sharing. I invite all railway parties to be strongly committed to enhancing railway safety by rigorously applying a robust Safety Management System and by implementing a positive railway safety culture.\u201d We notice a sound progress in railway interoperability concerning the alignment of operational frameworks in terms of rules, however only modest improvements are visible in making the railway assets interoperable. At border crossings the weaknesses in railway interoperability are most visible.

Dr. Doppelbauer stressed the important commitment of supporting railway safety and interoperability in the EUMedRail countries, the new role of the Agency as a rail authority in the EU and a Safety Management System based on risks, rules and behavior. The rapporteur of the EUYear of Rail 2021 in the European Parliament, Ms. Anna Deparnay-Grunenberg, emphasized railways for being a sustainable, innovative and safe mode of transport helping the EU to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. The EU Year of Rail 2021, she said, will praise rail as the sustainable mode of transport and fruitful discussions will follow to understand the needs to make the shift from road to rail. Improving digitalisation and interoperability, investments of rolling stock, accelerating the deployment of European train management systems (ERTMS) and promoting the use of cross-border night trains are some of the initiatives identified. The Secretary General of OTIF, Mr. K\u00fcpper, also intervened to stress the role of OTIF and the COTIF Convention to promote, improve and facilitate international traffic by rail. After these keynote interventions, the project officer, Mr. Ilyas Daoud, revised the actions undertaken in 2020, which due to the covid-19 pandemic and mobility restrictions had a mix format of physical and virtual meetings. The EUMedRail partners presented the latest initiatives implemented in the field of railways and explained the measures and protocol implemented to adapt the sector to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the meeting, the project partners had also the chance of providing additional comments to the evaluation on the Regional Transport Action Plan 2014-2020. The project manager, Mr. Peter Mihm, presented a proposal of activities envisaged for the years 2021 and 2022 including webinars, bilateral meetings ,seminars and as far as possible traineeships at ERA. The work plan for 2021 and 2022 considers actions in the field of Safety Management System through the promotion of safety operations and maintenance, institution capacity building, promotion of international railway transport and technical interoperability, involvement of the EUMedRail partners in the events organised by ERA and tailored assistance agreed with the countries.

We look forward to building synergies between the different transport modes: maritime transport for heavy and long distances, railway transport across borders and along corridors, and road transport for the last miles\u201d Following a first videoconference meeting which took place on Tuesday 5 May, Karima Delli, the chairwoman of the \u2018transport and tourism\u2019 committee of the European Parliament, together with the Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) and the CEOs of the European rail freight transport companies members of the Rail Freight Forward Initiative, have decided to set up a new coalition of rail freight. While rail freight lies within the cleanest transport modes when it comes to transport of goods, fostering modal shift across the EU appears to be a matter of top priority. It is one of the solutions to comply with the ambitions of the Green Deal as well as our climate goals. The current polycrisis that affects the whole World has however had significant impacts on the overall economy, then on rail freight too. The sector needs to be supported to be able to survive this crisis and to meet our expectations on sustainability over the upcoming months, which could lead to an effective European green logistic chain. The rail freight coalition aims at working on the ways to encourage modal shift and rail freight, with the ambition to increase the modal share of rail freight in Europe from currently 18% to 30% by 2030 and beyond. It is then about reversing the current trend which has been tending to let rail freight down. The stakeholders have identified four working issues: Rail freight as a priority: Rail and road freight do not face the same costs and competition issues. The Council must resume work and conclude the discussions on the Eurocharging directive as quick as possible, in order to launch trialogues over the upcoming months. A whole discussion on competition between road and rail must be held at the top level. Rail freight has been key during the Coronavirus crisis, and will keep on being essential. The sector is however not a priority compared to rail passenger transport. The situation should be balanced in the future. Rail freight is international and the revision of the Rail Freight Corridors Regulation 913/2010 should lead to the respective governance structures. Need of economic and financial support: The sector must be incentivised to be able to overcome the current crisis. Economic and financial support should however be conditioned to ecofriendly/green investments (see below).Member States should also take measures on track access fees, to make them lower for rail freight operators while compensating infrastructure managers for the loss of revenue, where there are losses; Investments: There is a clear need to undertake massive investments (e.g. new traffic control systems) to strengthen and foster modal shift across the EU and the rail freight sector. They should be targeted on infrastructure: digitalisation and investments in new technologies will make possible to set up more capacity on tracks, especially on Rail Freight Corridors. Those investments must comply with the climate objectives, when it comes to infrastructures and technologies. Investments in rail freight is not an end in itself. Rail operators should also pay close attention to what they deliver. Digitalisation: To make rail freight as effective and green as possible, new technologies are one of the solutions, in terms of digitalisation, standardisation etc (e.g. digital European capacity planning). The use of new technologies must however comply with preservation of jobs as well as with strict data policies. \u00a0 Delli Karima, Chairwoman of the \u2018transport\u2019 committee of the European Parliament Doppelbauer Josef, Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) Bedn\u00e1rik Ivan,\u00a0\u010cD\u00a0CargoDebaisieux Nicolas,\u00a0RailCoopDel Carmen Rinc\u00f3n Mar\u00eda,\u00a0RenfeDelorme Frederic,\u00a0SNCFEngstrand Gustaf,\u00a0T\u00e5gf\u00f6retagenFlore Sven,\u00a0SBB CargoFoerst Clemens,\u00a0RailCargoGiaconia Maria Annunziata,\u00a0MercitaliaMandl Andreas,\u00a0LTE GroupMaslikov Yuriy,\u00a0MT GroupNikutta Sigrid,\u00a0DBPauwels Geert,\u00a0LineasS\u00f6derholm Ted,\u00a0Green CargoStahl Dirk,\u00a0BLSVoz\u00e1r Martin,\u00a0ZSSK CargoWarsewicz Czes\u0142aw,\u00a0PKP CargoZenner Laurence,\u00a0CFL CargoFeighan Conor,\u00a0European Rail Freight Association (ERFA)Lochman Libor,\u00a0Community of European Railway and Infrastructure Companies\u00a0(CER) ", "url": "https://www.era.europa.eu/content/karima-delli-and-rail-freight-transport-sector-call-commission-and-member-states-foster_en"}, {"id": "ERA_NEWS_0029", "date": "2020-04-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Temporary measures to be adopted by railway Notified Bodies for the Evaluation activities", "text": " The exceptional circumstances and restrictions established by the vast majority of Member States to contain the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), are temporarily preventing NoBos from efficiently carrying out their planned evaluation activities.

The following days, on 16 and 17 October, experts participated in the CCRCC #ERTMS2019 - conference \u201cThe Engine for the Digital Future\u201d. This benchmark event gathered almost 500 experts from the Railway sector, including Railway Undertakings, Infrastructure Managers, Industry Suppliers and decision makers from across the world. The CCRCC 2019 dealt with the progress made on the ERTMS EDP (Deployment Plan) and high-level experts from Denmark, Italy, Belgium and Spain shared their experience on how they are making progress to meet the targets set by the ERTMS EDP. The Agency is the ERTMS system authority that manages the technical specifications for the European Train Control System (ETCS) and the Global System of Mobile Communications \u2013 Railway (GSM-R). The meeting revised the new responsibilities of the EU Agency for Railways regarding the ERTMS set by the Fourth Railway Package.

Market participants in Europe should learn about the advantages of this new authorisation regime, and lend it their support \u2013 as one of the key challenges for this process is the transposition of European legislation into national law, which will have to be complete by 2019/2020. The implementing acts that lay the foundation for these European processes will be voted by the EU Member States in the Railway Interoperability and Safety Committee (RISC) in July 2017. In and get a full-hearted buy-in of national decision makers for the new European processes, it is necessary to engage in an open an intense debate, and put forward clear and concise information about these new processes. The European Commission and the European Union Agency for Railways have therefore launched a series of regional debates, where stakeholders can voice their opinions and doubts in their native language, and get a clear idea of the benefits of the new process.
