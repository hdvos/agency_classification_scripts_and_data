ERA_NEWS_0005	2021-10-07	NEWS	Positive Safety Culture to Bring European Rail Safety to Next Level	 Rail officials honour the importance of the European Rail Climate Survey (ERA-SCS), the first pan-European sectoral survey on safety perception, as hallmark for a positive culture and important step for harmonising and improving rail safety in Europe The central role of railways for future sustainable European transport was acknowledged upon the arrival of the Connecting Europe Express to its final destination at Paris Gare de l’Est by the many officials present, celebrating the European Year of Rail 2021. The European Union Agency for Railways (ERA), together with SNCF Chairman and CEO Jean-Pierre Farandou, Henrik Hololei, Director-General for Mobility and Transport at the European Commission, and the Secretary-General of the European Transport Workers Federation (ETF) Livia Spera, used the occasion to promote the European Rail Climate Survey (ERA-SCS), a pan-European initiative to collect safety perception from the employees in the rail sector. While the survey is open until 31 October 2021, the Agency and its partners managed to obtain more than 43.000 responses from European rail workers since its launch in early 2021. The survey is the first of its kind to be launched at European level to an entire industry sector. Its findings will be used to improve rail safety in Europe. “The more answers to the ERA-SCS, the better the quality of the data and the higher relevance of the following analyses - so I count on the railway professionals in Europe to give us their honest opinion”, asserted Henrik Hololei. “This is a good step towards making sure workers’ voices are heard as they are the only ones who know the reality of their workplace. Health and safety at work is a right, not a privilege. Therefore ETF is pleased to have been part of the ERA-SCS”, said ETF General Secretary Livia Spera. SNCF Chairman and CEO Jean-Pierre Farandou added: “Safety has always been the top priority for the SNCF group. We are proud to have contributed close to 10.000 responses to this important pan-European survey.” ERA Executive Director Josef Doppelbauer concluded: “Safety is the essential precondition for successful rail business. The survey is still open until 31 October – so I urge all rail professionals in Europe to fill in the survey today!”   About the European Rail Safety Culture Survey (ERA-SCS) era-scs In order to further improve safety in the European rail system, the Agency is launching a unique safety perception survey open to all rail professionals working in the European Union and in EFTA states: the European Rail Safety Climate Survey (ERA-SCS).

ERA_NEWS_0012	2021-06-03	NEWS	Study: rail travel remains safer than car travel, even during the pandemic	" Available information suggests clearly that European citizens are concerned about travelling by train and other forms of collective transport during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people seem to have switched from using trains to travelling by car in 2020 and 2021. As always in times of uncertainty, mathematical models based on available evidence can help to estimate the actual risks and add to more objectivity. That is why ERA develops in this study a first model to estimate the COVID-19 risk when travelling long-distance by train in order to provide the necessary knowledge that can be used by decision makers and the public. “Most human beings, including decision makers, seem to have difficulty to estimate and manage risks […]When used correctly, the model can help to make the situation more tangible, yet controllable. However it is important to carefully take into account all assumptions, evidences and boundary conditions”, says Torben Holvad, ERA’s editor of the study. The study confirms that the overall fatality risk travelling by public transport is a multiple higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than in other times. However, individual car travel currently remains more dangerous than rail, taking into account the overall safety risk, also under the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context with vaccines being rapidly distributed, the overall picture is even clearer in terms of the ranking of overall fatality risk ranking between rail and car. Sensitivity testing, e.g. including more infectious new virus variants, has confirmed the robustness of the results that can be obtained by using the model. When safety measures are in place, like masks and distancing, cleaning and discouraging infected people to travel, the risk of being infected when travelling by train can be significantly reduced. ""During this pandemic the Agency is supporting the railway sector by giving technical advice, e.g. with the COVID-19 Rail Protocol and the COVID Ventilation Bulletin published in 2020 and it continues to closely monitor the situation in permanent contact with national authorities, the European Commission and its stakeholders”, says Josef Doppelbauer, Executive Director of ERA. “In order to reach our climate goals and to avoid massive congestion problems when citizens continue to travel by car after the pandemic, it is essential to rebuild trust in railways and make rail the first choice."" This is the reason why ERA proposes a joint Post-Pandemic Rail Recovery Campaign, to be developed together with the European Commission and European sector organisations. In the European Year of Rail, this initiative would help to restore trust and promote both rail passenger and freight transport as currently the most sustainable mode of transport. About the EU Agency for Railways The European Union Agency for Railways was established in Valenciennes (offices) and Lille (meeting facilities) in 2004. Its 170 employees represent more than 22 European Member States and speak multiple languages. ERA has been providing EU Member States and the European Commission with technical assistance in the development and implementation of the Single European Railway Area. This comprises enhancing technical interoperability and harmonising rules, promoting simplified access for customers, developing a common approach to safety and safety culture, advising on telematics applications and ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System), monitoring National Safety Authorities and Notified Bodies and facilitating the exchange of information between the railway actors in Europe. Since 16th June 2019 the EU Agency for Railways is mandated to issue single safety certificates and vehicle (type) authorisations valid in multiple European countries and to ensure an interoperable European Rail Traffic Management System. The purpose of these activities is expressed by the slogan “Making the railway system work better for society.” "	https://www.era.europa.eu/content/study-rail-travel-remains-safer-car-travel-even-during-pandemic_en

ERA_NEWS_0015	2021-05-28	NEWS	EUMedRail workshop on safety certification and supervision	 The purpose of the event was to reflect on how railway companies can demonstrate that they have established a functional safety management system, and how safety authorities can check and monitor the effectiveness and performance of such systems, as required by EU legislation.  The first day focused on safety certification and informed about the requirements laid down in EU regulations on railway safety management systems and the defined harmonised procedures to obtain from European authorities a safety certificate, as a prerequisite, to operate on the railway network in the European Union. ERA presented the requirements structured in a Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) cycle and explained the overall safety assessment process, also supported by ERA guidance documents on safety certification: from the application submitted by railway companies, the role and task of assessors, and the assessment till the decision taken, including the conditions applicable for the renewal, modifications, restrictions or revocations of safety certificates.  The French (EPSF) and Finnish (Traficom) national safety authorities reported on their experiences with issuing safety certificates and highlighted the benefits of the new EU legal regime, introduced under the 4th railway package. Specific attention had been given to the advantages of harmonised procedures, but also to the challenges posed by some requirements (e.g.  the integration of human and organisational factors or the development of a positive safety culture). The Ministry of Transport from Israel explained that a comparable safety certification scheme had been introduced in Isrel, and informed about the steps and processes used to certify, since 2018, the safety management system of its national railway operator, Israel Railways (ISR).  On the second day, experts of ERA and national authorities described supervision as a key process to ensure the effective application of railway safety management systems, and pointed out the need for national safety authorities to design and implement a comprehensive strategy to supervise railway companies. The purpose of this strategy is to make sure railway companies effectively apply their safety management system provisions on a continuous basis during the period of validity of their safety certificates.  To do so, ERA explained the way national safety authorities develop their strategies and implement subsequent plans addressing major railway risks, referring to some key principles such as proportionality, consistency, transparency, accountability, or cooperation to ensure sound and fair decision making.   The Belgian national safety authority (SSICF/DVIS) provided an overview of the different supervision techniques used, from operational controls, on-site inspections to system audits, highlighting the need to go beyond compliance, and drive railway companies towards more efficiency and efficacy of their safety management systems.  The Ministry of Transport from Tunisia reported on some of the tasks carried out to regulate safety, and to monitor the performance of its national operator, SNCFT, through indicators. Debates with participants focused on the need to strengthen safety management systems, create safety authorities in the region and foster cooperation with the EU and between partners of the region.

ERA_NEWS_0021	2020-07-16	NEWS	ERA publishes biennial Report on Progress with Railway Safety and Interoperability in the EU	 Monitoring safety and interoperability of the Union railway system is one of the key tasks of the European Union Agency for Railways. The report published today is based on data for the reporting period 2018, and where available, for 2019. This report provides a thorough overview of the development of railway safety and interoperability in the European Union. It should facilitate evidence-based policy-making at EU level. European railways remain among the safest in the world with one passenger fatality occurring each 25 billion kilometers on average. Major accidents with more than five fatalities are becoming increasingly rare, 2018 being the first year since the late 1980s with no major railway accident reported. ERA’s Executive Director, Josef Doppelbauer however urges the sector: ”We can never afford to be complacent. Unlike the European aviation and maritime industries, railways still have not implemented a systematic and comprehensive EU-wide safety occurrence reporting scheme, which would enable not only to learn effectively from major accidents, but also from incidents without victims. Several areas in which safety has been stagnating recently, such as level crossing and railway workers safety, or rolling stock fires, would particularly benefit from wider information sharing. I invite all railway parties to be strongly committed to enhancing railway safety by rigorously applying a robust Safety Management System and by implementing a positive railway safety culture.” We notice a sound progress in railway interoperability concerning the alignment of operational frameworks in terms of rules, however only modest improvements are visible in making the railway assets interoperable. At border crossings the weaknesses in railway interoperability are most visible. In many areas, delays in the implementation of legal requirements in a few Member States consequently delay the interoperable deployment of railways in other countries, depriving them of the full benefits from the harmonised system. “We all need to enhance our efforts in particular in the area of railway data interoperability”, says Josef Doppelbauer: “high quality interoperable railway data are essential for European railways. I invite all parties involved to intensify their collaboration with the Agency.” The report geographically covers the 28 Member States as of end 2019. Since Cyprus and Malta do not have railway systems that are covered by the EU legislation, the Union railway system is constituted by 26 Member States. Download the report.

Dr. Doppelbauer stressed the important commitment of supporting railway safety and interoperability in the EUMedRail countries, the new role of the Agency as a rail authority in the EU and a Safety Management System based on risks, rules and behavior. The rapporteur of the EUYear of Rail 2021 in the European Parliament, Ms. Anna Deparnay-Grunenberg, emphasized railways for being a sustainable, innovative and safe mode of transport helping the EU to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. The EU Year of Rail 2021, she said, will praise rail as the sustainable mode of transport and fruitful discussions will follow to understand the needs to make the shift from road to rail. Improving digitalisation and interoperability, investments of rolling stock, accelerating the deployment of European train management systems (ERTMS) and promoting the use of cross-border night trains are some of the initiatives identified. The Secretary General of OTIF, Mr. Küpper, also intervened to stress the role of OTIF and the COTIF Convention to promote, improve and facilitate international traffic by rail. After these keynote interventions, the project officer, Mr. Ilyas Daoud, revised the actions undertaken in 2020, which due to the covid-19 pandemic and mobility restrictions had a mix format of physical and virtual meetings. The EUMedRail partners presented the latest initiatives implemented in the field of railways and explained the measures and protocol implemented to adapt the sector to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the meeting, the project partners had also the chance of providing additional comments to the evaluation on the Regional Transport Action Plan 2014-2020. The project manager, Mr. Peter Mihm, presented a proposal of activities envisaged for the years 2021 and 2022 including webinars, bilateral meetings ,seminars and as far as possible traineeships at ERA. The work plan for 2021 and 2022 considers actions in the field of Safety Management System through the promotion of safety operations and maintenance, institution capacity building, promotion of international railway transport and technical interoperability, involvement of the EUMedRail partners in the events organised by ERA and tailored assistance agreed with the countries.

ERA_NEWS_0028	2020-05-28	NEWS	Karima Delli and the rail freight transport sector call on the Commission and the  Member States to foster modal shift	 “We are then all committed to relaunch rail freight as far as possible. We look forward to building synergies between the different transport modes: maritime transport for heavy and long distances, railway transport across borders and along corridors, and road transport for the last miles” Following a first videoconference meeting which took place on Tuesday 5 May, Karima Delli, the chairwoman of the ‘transport and tourism’ committee of the European Parliament, together with the Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) and the CEOs of the European rail freight transport companies members of the Rail Freight Forward Initiative, have decided to set up a new coalition of rail freight. While rail freight lies within the cleanest transport modes when it comes to transport of goods, fostering modal shift across the EU appears to be a matter of top priority. It is one of the solutions to comply with the ambitions of the Green Deal as well as our climate goals. The current polycrisis that affects the whole World has however had significant impacts on the overall economy, then on rail freight too. The sector needs to be supported to be able to survive this crisis and to meet our expectations on sustainability over the upcoming months, which could lead to an effective European green logistic chain. The rail freight coalition aims at working on the ways to encourage modal shift and rail freight, with the ambition to increase the modal share of rail freight in Europe from currently 18% to 30% by 2030 and beyond. It is then about reversing the current trend which has been tending to let rail freight down. The stakeholders have identified four working issues: Rail freight as a priority: Rail and road freight do not face the same costs and competition issues. The Council must resume work and conclude the discussions on the Eurocharging directive as quick as possible, in order to launch trialogues over the upcoming months. A whole discussion on competition between road and rail must be held at the top level. Rail freight has been key during the Coronavirus crisis, and will keep on being essential. The sector is however not a priority compared to rail passenger transport. The situation should be balanced in the future. Rail freight is international and the revision of the Rail Freight Corridors Regulation 913/2010 should lead to the respective governance structures. Need of economic and financial support: The sector must be incentivised to be able to overcome the current crisis. Economic and financial support should however be conditioned to ecofriendly/green investments (see below).Member States should also take measures on track access fees, to make them lower for rail freight operators while compensating infrastructure managers for the loss of revenue, where there are losses; Investments: There is a clear need to undertake massive investments (e.g. new traffic control systems) to strengthen and foster modal shift across the EU and the rail freight sector. They should be targeted on infrastructure: digitalisation and investments in new technologies will make possible to set up more capacity on tracks, especially on Rail Freight Corridors. Those investments must comply with the climate objectives, when it comes to infrastructures and technologies. Investments in rail freight is not an end in itself. Rail operators should also pay close attention to what they deliver. Digitalisation: To make rail freight as effective and green as possible, new technologies are one of the solutions, in terms of digitalisation, standardisation etc (e.g. digital European capacity planning). The use of new technologies must however comply with preservation of jobs as well as with strict data policies.   Delli Karima, Chairwoman of the ‘transport’ committee of the European Parliament Doppelbauer Josef, Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) Bednárik Ivan, ČD CargoDebaisieux Nicolas, RailCoopDel Carmen Rincón María, RenfeDelorme Frederic, SNCFEngstrand Gustaf, TågföretagenFlore Sven, SBB CargoFoerst Clemens, RailCargoGiaconia Maria Annunziata, MercitaliaMandl Andreas, LTE GroupMaslikov Yuriy, MT GroupNikutta Sigrid, DBPauwels Geert, LineasSöderholm Ted, Green CargoStahl Dirk, BLSVozár Martin, ZSSK CargoWarsewicz Czesław, PKP CargoZenner Laurence, CFL CargoFeighan Conor, European Rail Freight Association (ERFA)Lochman Libor, Community of European Railway and Infrastructure Companies (CER) 	https://www.era.europa.eu/content/karima-delli-and-rail-freight-transport-sector-call-commission-and-member-states-foster_en

ERA_NEWS_0032	2020-04-07	NEWS	First Safety Culture Series guidance now available	 To provide support to the European railway sector to effectively implement the complex concept of safety culture, the EU Agency for Railways has decided to publish a series of concise guidelines under a new sequence called “safety culture series”. The first volume of this guidance, Introduction to the European Railway Safety Culture Model, is published today. The aim of this first guide is to explain the European railway safety culture model as a tool to understand how safety culture develops and can be influenced. The target audience is wide, covering regulators, senior managers, rail safety managers, supervisors, researchers and all other individuals interested in the concept of safety culture. The European railway safety culture model is an effective tool to support all the players to contribute to improving railway safety. It is the result of the work of a dedicated task force with professionals from diverse backgrounds representing different types of organisations and from a variety of Member States. The model has been successfully tested and practically implemented to evaluate and improve railway safety culture. Safety is not only about regulation, rules and procedures. Safety is about a living and collective commitment. By developing useful instruments to support the sector, the European Union Agency for Railways is demonstrating its engagement to develop a positive safety culture. However we need the commitment of all players to achieve a sustainable and safe performance in the Single European Railway Area. You can find more information on safety culture on our website where you can also download the guidance.

ERA_NEWS_0050	2019-11-12	NEWS	Euromed and Western Balkans participate to the ERTMS Seminar and CCRCC 2019 organised by the EU Agency for Railways	 Throughout the seminar, delegations from Western Balkans and Southern Mediterranean countries expanded their knowledge on the European train protection system ERTMS, including the Regulatory framework, the technical components and had an introduction to ETCS. Participants also discussed with experts from the EU Agency for Railways the railway radio communication system, GSM-R, which is expected to be followed by the Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS) from 2030 onwards. The migration challenges and planning of investments raised interest from many of the representatives, too. The following days, on 16 and 17 October, experts participated in the CCRCC #ERTMS2019 - conference “The Engine for the Digital Future”. This benchmark event gathered almost 500 experts from the Railway sector, including Railway Undertakings, Infrastructure Managers, Industry Suppliers and decision makers from across the world. The CCRCC 2019 dealt with the progress made on the ERTMS EDP (Deployment Plan) and high-level experts from Denmark, Italy, Belgium and Spain shared their experience on how they are making progress to meet the targets set by the ERTMS EDP. The Agency is the ERTMS system authority that manages the technical specifications for the European Train Control System (ETCS) and the Global System of Mobile Communications – Railway (GSM-R). The meeting revised the new responsibilities of the EU Agency for Railways regarding the ERTMS set by the Fourth Railway Package. Since June 2019 ERA acts as authority for the certification of SMS but also authorization of railway vehicles. The new task authorising vehicles, including ERTMS on-board subsystem, marks an important milestone too. This goes in parallel to the process of ERMTS trackside approval. This conference assessed the challenges that the Future Rail Mobile Communications System (FRMCS) will represent as a successor of GSM-R. European Union and national representatives together with railway stakeholders voiced their opinion on the role that ERTMS, digitalisation and big-data should have and put forward the challenges that these new features represent for the railway industry innovation.

ERA_NEWS_0051	2019-06-16	NEWS	ERA becomes European authority for cross-border rail traffic in Europe	 Ushering a new era of simplified processes for the European rail market, companies operating across EU borders may now rely on one single, integrated process to obtain vehicle authorisations, single safety certificates or to request ERTMS* trackside approval. From 16 June 2019 onwards they must contact the European Union Agency for Railways in Valenciennes and file only one application through its One-Stop Shop IT tool (OSS). Upon receipt of an application, ERA assigns a project manager who is the personal contact for the applicant and who advises him/her throughout the process. Dedicated multilingual expert teams assess each application. This is a substantial change for the European rail system. Bulgaria, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, The Netherlands, Romania and Slovenia have adopted the new regime in June 2019, while other countries chose to transpose the new legislation by June 2020.

ERA_NEWS_0057	2019-05-07	NEWS	JNS urgent procedure ‘Great Belt Bridge accident 2nd Jan. 2019’	 In the wake of the tragic railway accident that occurred on the Great Belt Bridge on January 2nd, all the railway players across Europe are committed to maintaining rail as the safest land transport mode. The interim findings from the National Investigation Body (NIB) of Denmark show that semi-trailers may not be sufficiently secured against movement when transported on pocket wagons. In particular, the mechanism that ensures the locking of the kingpin in the hitch (type FW6170) of the pocket wagons was found to be unlocked on several occasions. Subsequently, the NIB has issued a corresponding safety alert. The National Safety Authority (NSA) of Denmark notified a request to launch a Joint Network Secretariat (JNS) Urgent Procedure. The JNS Panel, representing the entire railway sector, agreed and established a task force which was organised and chaired by the European Union Agency for Railways. The task force was composed of experts from the concerned sector organisations and has defined an action plan containing short-term mitigation measures. These measures aim at ensuring: appropriate maintenance of the hitch and in particular of the mechanism to lock the kingpin; correct positioning of semi-trailers on the pocket wagon for the entire duration of the trip; and the vertical locking of the semi-trailers’ kingpin. The measures can be found at the website of the European Union Agency for Railways and will be distributed to all actors involved in the transport of semi-trailers on pocket wagons.

ERA_NEWS_0084	2018-04-16	NEWS	Multimodal Year 2018 - Event on EU Freight	 Thanks to all Participants and Speakers for a Lively Debate - Presentations and Pictures Below The future of transport in Europe is driven by the need to dramatically reduce its environmental impact, while at the same time reaping the opportunities of the digital revolution and maintaining a strong position in global competition. The key for this future is multimodal transport. This is why European Commissioner Violeta Bulc has proclaimed 2018 the Year of Multimodality – and it is in this light that the European Commission, the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA), and the International Union for Road-Rail Combined Transport (UIRR) have joined forces to gather the different modes of transport in Europe to take stock of pressing regulatory issues at EU level, and have an overview of future technologies and business flows for freight transportation. You are cordially invited to join the lively debate with EU decision-makers and peers on 16 May 2018 at the EU Representation of the Free State of Bavaria.

ERA_NEWS_0087	2018-03-12	NEWS	EUMEDRAIL Project Strengthens Collaboration between Europe and Southern Mediterranean region	 ​Started in January 2017, the EUMEDRAIL is an EU-funded project under the leadership of the Agency, to promote best practices, regulation and standards to the beneficiaries of the Southern Mediterranean Region including Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia and regions under Palestinian Authority. In accordance with the Regional Transport Action Plan signed by the ministers of transport, ERA will provide technical assistance for building up National Safety Authorities and National Accident investigation bodies in those regions, in accordance with European railway regulations for safe and interoperable railway transport, and that of the Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail (OTIF). Many EU neighbour states pursue ambitious plans to modernise railway systems. For example, Marokko will open the first highspeed railway line in Africa by end of 2018. EUMEDRAIL is working closely with OTIF to promote urban transport projects in those regions, but also to implement effective safety management systems, accident investigation, and train driver trainings. The EUMEDRAIL activities are highly appreciated in the target regions, resulting in plans to establish further common and bilateral actions. Following the EUMEDRAIL Kick-off meeting in October 2017, as part of the collaboration with the 8 beneficiaries of the Southern Mediterranean Region, a workshop on international railway regulations was organised on 6 February 2018 in Belgrade, with high ranking delegations from all target countries. An 'action plan conference' will be held on 23-25 April 2018 in Ljubljana.

ERA_NEWS_0089	2018-02-13	NEWS	CEN, CENELEC and ERA restate their commitment to working together	 The signature on 12 February 2018 of the renewed cooperation agreement between the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) and the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) of the European Commission will further enhance the harmonization of technical standards for Railways. Renewed agreement reaffirms longstanding cooperation Through the agreement, CEN and CENELEC together with ERA will provide a comprehensive set of technical documents aiming to guarantee a high level of railway safety and interoperability, and improve the competitive position of the railway sector. The agreement reaffirms a longstanding cooperation in the field of technical standardization in support of Interoperability and Safety of Railways established under the previous Cooperation Agreement signed in May 2007. The partners already collaborate in a wide range of projects and technical fields, and aim at reducing the number of contradictory technical specifications still existing in the sector. Speaking on the occasion of the signing ceremony in Brussels on 12 February, Dr. Josef Doppelbauer, Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Railways said: “This agreement will strengthen the long-standing favourable cooperation between CEN and CENELEC and we look forward to working together to establish a sustainable and efficient railway transport system in Europe, taking also benefit of a reinforced collaboration between researchers, innovators and standardizers”. Elena Santiago Cid, Director General of CEN and CENELEC, added: “We look forward to continuing our productive co-operation with the Railway Agency and we welcome the good working exchanges aiming at developing harmonized standards supporting the Safety Essential Requirements of the Interoperability of the Rail System Directive, and complementing the Technical Specifications of Interoperability developed by the Agency.” Collaboration important for uptake of standardization in EU policies Standardization is a key element in many EU policies and for achieving policy goals. Therefore, a strong cross-sector and multi-disciplinary cooperation between CEN and CENELEC, and the European Agencies is vital to ensure effective uptake of standardization in EU policy making. As the Agency in charge of development of railway specifications, ERA provides the EU Member States and the Commission with technical assistance in the fields of railway safety and interoperability. This involves the development and implementation of Technical Specifications for Interoperability and a common approach to questions concerning railway safety.

Market participants in Europe should learn about the advantages of this new authorisation regime, and lend it their support – as one of the key challenges for this process is the transposition of European legislation into national law, which will have to be complete by 2019/2020. The implementing acts that lay the foundation for these European processes will be voted by the EU Member States in the Railway Interoperability and Safety Committee (RISC) in July 2017. In and get a full-hearted buy-in of national decision makers for the new European processes, it is necessary to engage in an open an intense debate, and put forward clear and concise information about these new processes. The European Commission and the European Union Agency for Railways have therefore launched a series of regional debates, where stakeholders can voice their opinions and doubts in their native language, and get a clear idea of the benefits of the new process.
