ERA_PR_0001	2021-06-03	PR	Study: rail travel remains safer than car travel, even during the pandemic	" Available information suggests clearly that European citizens are concerned about travelling by train and other forms of collective transport during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people seem to have switched from using trains to travelling by car in 2020 and 2021. As always in times of uncertainty, mathematical models based on available evidence can help to estimate the actual risks and add to more objectivity. That is why ERA develops in this study a first model to estimate the COVID-19 risk when travelling long-distance by train in order to provide the necessary knowledge that can be used by decision makers and the public. “Most human beings, including decision makers, seem to have difficulty to estimate and manage risks […]When used correctly, the model can help to make the situation more tangible, yet controllable. However it is important to carefully take into account all assumptions, evidences and boundary conditions”, says Torben Holvad, ERA’s editor of the study. The study confirms that the overall fatality risk travelling by public transport is a multiple higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than in other times. However, individual car travel currently remains more dangerous than rail, taking into account the overall safety risk, also under the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context with vaccines being rapidly distributed, the overall picture is even clearer in terms of the ranking of overall fatality risk ranking between rail and car. Sensitivity testing, e.g. including more infectious new virus variants, has confirmed the robustness of the results that can be obtained by using the model. When safety measures are in place, like masks and distancing, cleaning and discouraging infected people to travel, the risk of being infected when travelling by train can be significantly reduced. ""During this pandemic the Agency is supporting the railway sector by giving technical advice, e.g. with the COVID-19 Rail Protocol and the COVID Ventilation Bulletin published in 2020 and it continues to closely monitor the situation in permanent contact with national authorities, the European Commission and its stakeholders”, says Josef Doppelbauer, Executive Director of ERA. “In order to reach our climate goals and to avoid massive congestion problems when citizens continue to travel by car after the pandemic, it is essential to rebuild trust in railways and make rail the first choice."" This is the reason why ERA proposes a joint Post-Pandemic Rail Recovery Campaign, to be developed together with the European Commission and European sector organisations. In the European Year of Rail, this initiative would help to restore trust and promote both rail passenger and freight transport as currently the most sustainable mode of transport. About the EU Agency for Railways The European Union Agency for Railways was established in Valenciennes (offices) and Lille (meeting facilities) in 2004. Its 170 employees represent more than 22 European Member States and speak multiple languages. ERA has been providing EU Member States and the European Commission with technical assistance in the development and implementation of the Single European Railway Area. This comprises enhancing technical interoperability and harmonising rules, promoting simplified access for customers, developing a common approach to safety and safety culture, advising on telematics applications and ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System), monitoring National Safety Authorities and Notified Bodies and facilitating the exchange of information between the railway actors in Europe. Since 16th June 2019 the EU Agency for Railways is mandated to issue single safety certificates and vehicle (type) authorisations valid in multiple European countries and to ensure an interoperable European Rail Traffic Management System. The purpose of these activities is expressed by the slogan “Making the railway system work better for society.” "	https://www.era.europa.eu/content/study-rail-travel-remains-safer-car-travel-even-during-pandemic_en

ERA_PR_0003	2021-06-16	PR	Promoting of best practice in accident and incident investigation in the EuroMed region	 On 15 and 16 June, representatives from national authorities and railway operators of Egypt, Israel, Morocco, and Tunisia took part in international workshops organised in the scope of the EUMedRail project. The aim was to discuss the setting-up of a permanent and independent investigation body as well as how to improve national procedures taking into account of EU experiences.  The workshops gave an opportunity to address topics such as accident investigation starting from the notification of such event, via occurrence reconstruction, analysis of safety management systems and identification of root causes and contributory factors, till the issuing of safety recommendations and elaboration of investigation reports.  ERA underlined the benefits of a harmonised framework and approach to accident and incident reporting, with a view to share lessons learnt and address similar safety risks in the future.  National investigation bodies from Belgium, Finland and the Netherlands illustrated, with a series of study cases, how state of the art investigations are carried out and informed how collection and processing of evidence during on-site examinations are carried out, informed about the analysis of safety management systems performance and the incidence of human and organisational factors, besides the issuing and follow-up of safety recommendations.    Participants also reflected on the cooperation between national safety authorities and investigation bodies at EU level, and examined the possibility to set up a regional network to continue the exchange of information, to share good practice in data collection, and closely monitor safety developments. 	https://www.era.europa.eu/content/promoting-best-practice-accident-and-incident-investigation-euromed-region_en
ERA_PR_0004	2021-04-26	PR	Risk mitigation measures to resume transport of semi-trailers on pocket wagons in Denmark	 Following the 13.01.2021 incident on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark, which happened at the same location as the severe accident of 02.01.2019, the Danish National Safety Authority imposed immediate measures which in practice have stopped the transport of semi-trailers on pocket wagons. Understanding the impact this ban has on rail freight transport companies and the need to urgently find solutions, the European Union Agency for Railways established a JNS Urgent Procedure Task Force. This Task Force aimed at identifying short-term risk mitigation measures in order to resume as soon as possible the transport of semi-trailers on pocket wagons on the Danish network and in particular on the Great Belt bridge. (more information: Joint Network Secretariat (JNS) Urgent Procedure and Normal Procedure) The Task Force, coordinated by ERA, was composed of representatives from the national safety authorities of Denmark, Sweden, Germany and The Netherlands as well as experts from the railway sector. The Task Force had its kick-off meeting on 04.02.2021 and concluded its work with the following outcome: read more. 	https://www.era.europa.eu/content/risk-mitigation-measures-resume-transport-semi-trailers-pocket-wagons-denmark_en

ERA_PR_0007	2021-03-20	PR	Publication of a white paper on Cybersecurity in Railways	 During the ENISA-ERA online conference on Cybersecurity in Railways, Laurent Cebulski, Managing Director of EPSF, the French National Safety Authority, announced a White Paper on how cybersecurity is considered by the railway sector in France. A Working Group composed of EPSF, ANSSI, the French Cybersecurity Agency, SNCF Réseaux, SNCF Voyageurs and the EU Agency for Railways has developed this White Paper to investigate how both the French/EU railway regulatory framework and the French/EU cybersecurity framework influence the measures to be taken to tackle cybersecurity in railways. 	https://www.era.europa.eu/content/publication-white-paper-cybersecurity-railways_en
ERA_PR_0008	2020-07-16	PR	ERA publishes biennial Report on Progress with Railway Safety and Interoperability in the EU	 Monitoring safety and interoperability of the Union railway system is one of the key tasks of the European Union Agency for Railways. The report published today is based on data for the reporting period 2018, and where available, for 2019. This report provides a thorough overview of the development of railway safety and interoperability in the European Union. It should facilitate evidence-based policy-making at EU level. European railways remain among the safest in the world with one passenger fatality occurring each 25 billion kilometers on average. Major accidents with more than five fatalities are becoming increasingly rare, 2018 being the first year since the late 1980s with no major railway accident reported. ERA’s Executive Director, Josef Doppelbauer however urges the sector: ”We can never afford to be complacent. Unlike the European aviation and maritime industries, railways still have not implemented a systematic and comprehensive EU-wide safety occurrence reporting scheme, which would enable not only to learn effectively from major accidents, but also from incidents without victims. Several areas in which safety has been stagnating recently, such as level crossing and railway workers safety, or rolling stock fires, would particularly benefit from wider information sharing. I invite all railway parties to be strongly committed to enhancing railway safety by rigorously applying a robust Safety Management System and by implementing a positive railway safety culture.” We notice a sound progress in railway interoperability concerning the alignment of operational frameworks in terms of rules, however only modest improvements are visible in making the railway assets interoperable. At border crossings the weaknesses in railway interoperability are most visible. In many areas, delays in the implementation of legal requirements in a few Member States consequently delay the interoperable deployment of railways in other countries, depriving them of the full benefits from the harmonised system. “We all need to enhance our efforts in particular in the area of railway data interoperability”, says Josef Doppelbauer: “high quality interoperable railway data are essential for European railways. I invite all parties involved to intensify their collaboration with the Agency.” The report geographically covers the 28 Member States as of end 2019. Since Cyprus and Malta do not have railway systems that are covered by the EU legislation, the Union railway system is constituted by 26 Member States. Download the report.

ERA_PR_0009	2019-11-27	PR	Term of ERA Executive Director, Josef Doppelbauer extended for another five-year term	 Taking office in January 2015, Josef Doppelbauer led the Agency to a new era as a European authority, where EU-wide vehicle authorisation, safety certification, and ERTMS trackside approval are granted. Preparing the Agency for these new tasks entailed a thorough internal restructuring, with staff numbers going up from roughly 160 in 2015 to close to 200 in 2019. The Agency welcomed a number of new highly trained experts from all over Europe in order to ensure the new tasks can be performed at all times and in all official EU languages. Another important item under Josef Doppelbauer’s leadership was the reduction of national rules, which is seen as vital precondition for the functional integration of the European rail market. Whereas there were more than 16.000 technical rules in 2016, the number has been reduced to little more than a 1.000 in 2019, with further reductions in the pipeline. 	https://www.era.europa.eu/content/term-era-executive-director-josef-doppelbauer-extended-another-five-year-term_en
ERA_PR_0010	2019-11-22	PR	ERA issues a single safety certificate for THALYS	" Josef Doppelbauer, Executive Director of ERA, signed today the single safety certificate for THALYS (THI Factory). This certificate is valid for a period of five years and covers an area of operation currently limited to France. THALYS continues to operate in Belgium under their safety certificates Part A and Part B until their validity expires. Patrice Lambert, Safety Director at THALYS, summarises: ""This certificate demonstrates THALYS’ commitment to the safety of its operations. By following ERA's processes, we have demonstrated our commitment to transparency and we are delighted that these efforts have been recognised by the European authorities. Engaging with ERA before the submission of the application and during the course of the assessment gave us a better understanding of the procedural stages and of what was expected from THALYS. This considerably facilitated the processing of the application. The One-Stop Shop supports the applicant in preparing its application file in a structured way, which should make updating and follow up during the supervision phase more transparent for the railway undertaking”. ERA’s Executive Director, Josef Doppelbauer, welcomes the positive experiences during the certification process with THALYS: “I am satisfied about the good collaboration of ERA staff with the French national safety authority (EPSF)”, he said, “but we recognise that there is more work to do to streamline the process for the benefit of all those involved.” "	https://www.era.europa.eu/content/era-issues-single-safety-certificate-thalys_en
ERA_PR_0011	2019-09-24	PR	First 100 days of new processes at ERA have proven successful	 Since June 16th 2019 ERA is the European institution mandated to authorise vehicles that operate across borders in Europe, to issue single safety certificates which are valid in multiple European states, and to ensure an interoperable European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). “Today, after 100 days of intense activities at the Agency as authorising entity, we are proud that the new processes are running smoothly”, says Josef Doppelbauer, Executive Director of ERA. The success of the first 100 days is an endorsement of the preparatory work done by the Agency that included, cooperation agreements with National Safety Authorities, peer review with the Management Board, an extensive programme of learning cases and positive collaboration with the National Safety Authorities. The Management Board will continue to monitor the implementation period in 2020 through its subgroup, the 4th Railway Package steering group.

ERA_PR_0012	2019-10-01	PR	Dutch railway industry leaders signed the European Railway Safety Culture Declaration in Utrecht	 Organised by the Dutch National Safety Authority, Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport (ILT), today’s conference brought together the leaders of the Dutch railway sector in Utrecht to discuss safety and leadership. Many leaders from the Dutch railway sector followed the call from Josef Doppelbauer, Executive Director of the EU Agency for Railways (ERA), and signed the European Railway Safety Culture Declaration, committing to raise awareness and to promote a positive safety culture throughout the entire industry. A positive safety culture reinforces the effects of a Safety Management System, improving the capability and efficiency of safety management. The EU Agency for Railways’ understanding of safety culture is: safety culture refers to the interaction between the requirements of the Safety Management System, how people make sense of them, based on their attitudes, values and beliefs and what they actually do, as seen in decisions and behaviours. A positive safety culture is characterised by a collective commitment by leaders and individuals to always act safely, in particular when confronted with competing goals. The EU Agency for Railways has developed safety leadership training, supporting the role of leaders in delivering safe performance, which it can deliver on request.

ERA has assigned dedicated multilingual expert teams to assess each application. 	https://www.era.europa.eu/content/era-issues-first-vehicle-authorisation-decision_en
ERA_PR_0016	2019-06-16	PR	ERA becomes European authority for cross-border rail traffic in Europe	 Ushering a new era of simplified processes for the European rail market, companies operating across EU borders may now rely on one single, integrated process to obtain vehicle authorisations, single safety certificates or to request ERTMS* trackside approval. From 16 June 2019 onwards they must contact the European Union Agency for Railways in Valenciennes and file only one application through its One-Stop Shop IT tool (OSS). Upon receipt of an application, ERA assigns a project manager who is the personal contact for the applicant and who advises him/her throughout the process. Dedicated multilingual expert teams assess each application. This is a substantial change for the European rail system. Bulgaria, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, The Netherlands, Romania and Slovenia have adopted the new regime in June 2019, while other countries chose to transpose the new legislation by June 2020. Switzerland will adopt the new regime on a case-by-case basis from June 2019. Dr Josef Doppelbauer, Executive Director of ERA stated: “For years, railway’s progress in Europe has been hampered by technical barriers and excessive cost. The new, simplified certification processes help breaking down the barriers and increasing harmonisation, which will improve the competitive position of railways.” Read more  For further information about this event, please contact us by email 	https://www.era.europa.eu/content/era-becomes-european-authority-cross-border-rail-traffic-europe_en
ERA_PR_0017	2019-05-07	PR	JNS urgent procedure ‘Great Belt Bridge accident 2nd Jan. 2019’	 In the wake of the tragic railway accident that occurred on the Great Belt Bridge on January 2nd, all the railway players across Europe are committed to maintaining rail as the safest land transport mode. The interim findings from the National Investigation Body (NIB) of Denmark show that semi-trailers may not be sufficiently secured against movement when transported on pocket wagons. In particular, the mechanism that ensures the locking of the kingpin in the hitch (type FW6170) of the pocket wagons was found to be unlocked on several occasions. Subsequently, the NIB has issued a corresponding safety alert. The National Safety Authority (NSA) of Denmark notified a request to launch a Joint Network Secretariat (JNS) Urgent Procedure. The JNS Panel, representing the entire railway sector, agreed and established a task force which was organised and chaired by the European Union Agency for Railways. The task force was composed of experts from the concerned sector organisations and has defined an action plan containing short-term mitigation measures. These measures aim at ensuring: appropriate maintenance of the hitch and in particular of the mechanism to lock the kingpin; correct positioning of semi-trailers on the pocket wagon for the entire duration of the trip; and the vertical locking of the semi-trailers’ kingpin. The measures can be found at the website of the European Union Agency for Railways and will be distributed to all actors involved in the transport of semi-trailers on pocket wagons.
