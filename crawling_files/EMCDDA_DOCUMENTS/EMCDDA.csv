EMCDDA_UNK_0001	2021-10-18	UNK	EMCDDA releases new European miniguides on responding to drug problems	 What are the most effective treatment options for cannabis problems? How to respond to new trends in cocaine use? How to help prevent the non-medical use of medicines? These are among the questions explored in a new collection of miniguides being launched today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). The miniguides — being released in four successive bundles between October 2021 and early 2022 — focus on patterns of use, harms, settings and vulnerable groups. Together, they make up the agency’s latest overview of actions and interventions now available to respond to the consequences of illicit drug use. Drawing on a fresh global review of the evidence, and insights from 29 countries (27 EU, Turkey and Norway), the miniguides are designed to support practitioners and policymakers in addressing the negative consequences of drug use. The resources are presented in a digital and modular format, designed to improve accessibility, to be easier to read across a range of devices and to facilitate regular updates and translations. Throughout the guides, ‘Spotlights’ focus on a number of hot topics requiring special attention today. These include COVID-19, drug use and sexual health, and the use of synthetic cannabinoids, fentanils and performance- and image-enhancing drugs. How to identify problems and choose the most appropriate responses is covered in an action framework accompanying the guides. First up this month are the miniguides on responding to specific patterns of drug use, covering cannabis, medicines, opioids, polydrug use, stimulants and new psychoactive substances (see below). Each miniguide provides an overview of the most important aspects to consider when planning or delivering health and social responses to particular drug-related problems. The miniguides review the availability and effectiveness of responses and consider implications for policy and practice. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘The EMCDDA is committed to assisting policymakers and practitioners in planning and delivering policies and programmes that contribute to a healthier and more secure Europe. Our latest European responses miniguides, delivered in a digital and modular format, examine some of the key public health challenges in the drugs field today and offer timely and practical advice for designing, targeting and implementing effective responses. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw how drug services were quick to adapt and innovate in a fast-moving crisis and in the face of an ever-more complex drugs phenomenon. We hope that these practical guides will equip them with the tools to respond to the drug problems of today, but also to prepare for those of tomorrow’.

EMCDDA_UNK_0003	2021-10-07	UNK	In Memoriam — Father Vítor Feytor Pinto	 It was with great sadness that the EMCDDA learned this week of the death of Father Vítor Feytor Pinto. The first Chair of the EMCDDA Management Board — a position he held between 1994 and 1997 — Father Feytor Pinto made a fundamental contribution to the creation of the agency and its early operational activities. As High Commissioner for Projecto VIDA (Project LIFE) and Drug coordinator of Portugal, Father Feytor Pinto also promoted the establishment of Observatório VIDA, the first Portuguese national focal point of the Reitox network. Here he dedicated his efforts to the smooth functioning of the focal point and a national network of data and information sources. In the late 1980s, Father Feytor Pinto was among the pioneers of a new approach to the drugs problem, both in Portugal and Europe, promoting awareness among policymakers of the importance of knowledge over dogma and ideology. He also highlighted the relevance of the health aspects of the drugs problem in an area hitherto dominated by a security perspective and control of supply. The Director of the EMCDDA and his staff acknowledge, and express their gratitude for, the role played by Father Vítor Feytor Pinto in the life of the agency, and send their heartfelt condolences to his family. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/memoriam-father-vitor-feytor-pinto_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0004	2021-10-04	UNK	Registration opens for European Drugs Winter and Summer Schools 2022	 The EMCDDA and the University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL) are pleased to open registration today for two upcoming joint events in 2022: the European Drugs Winter School (EDWS) and the European Drugs Summer School (EDSS) (1) (2). EDWS: 14–25 February 2022 (online): Following the success of the first EDWS in 2021, the organisers have decided to deliver the second virtual EDWS in 2022, this time on the theme of ‘Cannabis: practice, policies and debates in the EU and beyond’. Adopting a similar structure to the 2021 edition, the two-week course will feature live lunchtime lectures with experts and practitioners, followed by afternoon exercises. Virtual fieldwork tours will also be offered. Completion of exercises and an exam are compulsory for those wishing to obtain credits. The sessions will be recorded and available for subsequent viewing. Increasing the offer of online training is in line with the EMCDDA’s digital transformation objectives. EDSS: 27 June to 8 July 2022 (Lisbon): This time, the two-week course will focus on ‘Community-based interventions for drug-related issues’. Sessions will include lectures on community-based interventions, such as low-threshold facilities, drug consumption rooms and outreach units. Study visits will be organised to one of the Portuguese commissions for dissuasion as well as a local harm reduction centre. During the course, students will participate in interactive workshops to discuss their own projects and views. The course will conclude with an open debate with guest speakers, followed by an exam for those wishing to obtain credits. All recommended COVID-19 safety measures will be put in place, if applicable. Deposits and fees will be reimbursed if the summer school is cancelled in case of force majeure. The target audiences for the two events are: university students, researchers, professionals and administrators interested in working on drug issues. The previous rounds of these courses brought together students from the EU Member States as well as from Africa, Asia, Australia and the Americas. Profiles of former alumni and their testimonials can be found on the official summer school website and their statements viewed in a promotional video (3). The courses prepare professionals and students to meet the complex policy challenges that face Europe in the field of drugs. Involving scientific experts from the EMCDDA, university professors and policymakers, they provide a multi-disciplinary and inclusive approach to the study of the drugs problem in Europe and beyond. Details on scholarships in 2022 are available on the event web pages. Both events will be conducted in English. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/registration-opens-european-drugs-winter-and-summer-schools-2022_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0005	2021-09-30	UNK	News from EU4Monitoring Drugs, an EMCDDA technical cooperation project	 This content was published in the EU4MD update released on 30.09.2021. This update also presents a section on partnerships, announcements, studies, upcoming events, and a research corner. Focus on: Methamphetamine from Afghanistan Europe should be better prepared for the prospect of methamphetamine coming from Afghanistan, according to a new EMCDDA report published on 29 September. Methamphetamine from Afghanistan: ‘signals indicate that Europe should be better prepared’ ’examines the recent emergence of methamphetamine production in the country and identifies actions that may be taken in Europe to mitigate the risks. The publication is the result of research conducted under the agency’s EU4MD and IPA7 projects, both funded by the European Commission. Spotlight on project experts For our first expert, we have selected Dr Viktor Mravčík, the head of the Czech National Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction at the Office of the Government. The Czech National Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is a member of the Reitox network  – a network of the national focal points in 27 EU Member States, Norway and Turkey, and the main source of drug-related information for the EMCDDA. What is your involvement in the EU4MD project?   I have been involved in training and coaching treatment monitoring experts from European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) countries to carry out treatment facility surveys using the European Facility Survey Questionnaire (EFSQ). The partner countries are currently finalising their country reports and I will work with those to prepare a multi-country analysis of treatment systems and capacities. I hope that this final analysis will become available in 2022.Why did you find it important to get involved in technical cooperation projects like EU4MD? Technical cooperation is very important. The experts from ENP countries get the chance to become familiar with the European standards and methodologies for monitoring of drug phenomena. I find it inspiring to be able to work with partners in the Neighbourhood and to see how my experience may contribute to their ability to better identify strengths and gaps in existing monitoring and drug treatment systems. I particularly like that this collaboration enables networking. We can exchange our know-how and, in the end, it results in better quality data. I believe that everyone involved has been profiting from the experience so far. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/news-eu4monitoring-drugs-emcdda-technical-cooperation-project_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0006	2021-09-29	UNK	Methamphetamine from Afghanistan: ‘signals indicate that Europe should be better prepared’, says new EMCDDA report 	 This report was prepared before recent developments in Afghanistan and before the withdrawal of US military and other NATO allies from the country. The findings of this report are preliminary and will need to be reviewed and updated as more information becomes available from the region. Europe should be better prepared for the prospect of methamphetamine coming from Afghanistan, according to a new report published today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) (1). The report examines the relatively recent emergence of methamphetamine production in the country and identifies actions that may be taken in Europe to mitigate the risks. The publication is the result of research conducted under the agency’s EU4MD and IPA7 projects, both funded by the European Commission. Afghanistan: a new player in the global methamphetamine market The expansion of the methamphetamine industry in Afghanistan in recent years follows the realisation by Afghan drug traders that ephedra plants (growing wild for centuries in the country’s central highlands) were a natural source of ephedrine, a precursor chemical used to make methamphetamine. Today’s report explains that methamphetamine production was already occurring in the country between 2013 and 2017, but was based on ephedrine extracted from imported medicines (e.g. cough syrups), in a costly process requiring specialised chemists. The country’s move into large-scale ephedra-based methamphetamine production from 2017 appears to have occurred relatively rapidly, resulting in a ‘thriving cottage industry’ for the extraction of ephedrine from dried ephedra crops by relatively low-skilled workers (2). Evidence suggests that large quantities of low-cost methamphetamine are manufactured in specialised facilities in the country by more skilled operators, known as ‘cooks’. The ‘full extent of ephedrine and methamphetamine production in Afghanistan remains unknown, but it could be considerable’, the report says. And while the availability of Afghan-origin methamphetamine on regional and international markets is difficult to estimate, chemical profiling by law enforcement suggests that it may have become available on consumer markets as far afield as east Africa and Australia. Iran: from producer to transit nation Iran has a longer history of methamphetamine production than neighbouring Afghanistan but there are signs that it is shifting from a producer to a transit nation. Since 2010, methamphetamine producers in Iran have faced growing economic, regulatory and law-enforcement pressures that have limited domestic production and led to a growing reliance on cheaper imports from Afghanistan. The Iranian authorities are reported to have played a key part in making domestic production riskier and less profitable. EMCDDA research points to the availability of ‘cheap Afghan meth’ across consumer markets in Iran, and very low retail prices have been noted. Seizure data suggest that Afghan ephedrine and methamphetamine (sometimes in liquid form) are potentially being reprocessed in Iran, raising concern that the phenomenon is growing and has the potential to spread. Possible consumer markets Seizures of methamphetamine in the EU have increased in the last 10 years, although not to levels observed elsewhere in the world. The current market for methamphetamine in Europe is much smaller than for other stimulants (e.g. cocaine and MDMA), with consumption restricted to specific countries, regions or user groups. ‘Nonetheless, there are concerns that interest in the drug may be growing and that it could have the potential to play a greater role in Europe’s future drugs problem’, states the report. Production inside Europe (located mostly in the Netherlands and Czechia) seems to be more than sufficient to satisfy current demand among European consumers. But the production of comparatively cheap and pure methamphetamine in Afghanistan remains a significant threat, as the drug could enter the European drug market via the well-established trafficking routes for smuggling Afghan heroin (notably the Balkan route via Iran and Turkey). As shown above, Afghan-origin methamphetamine is seen to be making its way to other consumer markets (e.g.  in east and southern Africa, South-East Asia and Oceania). Mitigating the risks in Europe To build on this strategic understanding of the situation, fill knowledge gaps and mitigate the risks, the report stresses the importance of increasing awareness on this issue among policy- and decision-makers in Europe and law-enforcement authorities (especially those located along traditional heroin trafficking routes). Also cited as a priority is training for customs officials, border guards and police authorities along the Balkan, southern and northern routes and at other key border crossing points, maritime ports and airports. Here, the risk of smuggling methamphetamine in liquid form should deserve particular consideration. Finally, the report underlines the need to monitor for any increased availability of crystal methamphetamine in Europe by drawing the attention, and boosting the preparedness, of drug service providers. In addition, the application of chemical profiling of methamphetamine seizures by forensic services, to investigate their route of manufacture, will also help to maintain vigilance on this issue. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/methamphetamine-afghanistan-signals-indicate-europe-should-be-better-prepared_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0007	2021-09-28	UNK	Green light for two-year work programme on bilateral cooperation with Georgia	 A two-year work programme on bilateral cooperation with Georgia was agreed upon today at the first advisory committee meeting of the EMCDDA4Georgia project, hosted virtually by the agency. Launched on 3 May this year, the project aims to enhance national responses to drug-related health and security threats and focuses primarily on knowledge transfer and capacity-building in the areas of drug monitoring, reporting, prevention and treatment. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel opened today’s meeting, underlining the importance of the project and thanking all partners for their commitment. He also welcomed and acknowledged the valuable participation of His Excellency Beka Dzamashvili, Deputy Minister of Justice of Georgia and Catalin Gherman, Deputy Head of Cooperation Section, Delegation of the European Union to Georgia. Deputy Minister Dzamashvili emphasised the longstanding collaboration between the Georgian government and the EMCDDA in the field of drugs and drug addiction, while Mr Gherman underlined that the challenges can only be tackled by joint efforts of all parties involved. The meeting was attended by representatives of the Delegation of the European Union to Georgia, as well as the European Commission’s Directorates-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations (DG NEAR) and Migration and Home Affairs (DG HOME), the Georgian National Drug Observatory, the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) and representatives and experts from a variety of Georgian Ministries.EMCDDA4GE is being implemented by the EMCDDA under the supervision of the Delegation of the EU to Georgia. The EMCDDA and Georgia have a long tradition of cooperation, illustrated, among others, by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the agency and the Georgian Ministry of Justice in 2015, which is currently being updated. The EMCDDA4GE project will build on the achievements and results of previous, and current, EMCDDA technical cooperation projects involving the country. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/green-light-two-year-work-programme-bilateral-cooperation-georgia_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0008	2021-09-28	UNK	Six steps to improve the quality of drug services and systems — EMCDDA launches new practical manual for decision-makers	 Six steps to help improve the quality of drug services and systems in Europe are presented today in a new manual from the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). Entitled Implementing quality standards for drug services and systems: a six-step guide to support quality assurance, the publication offers practical advice for professionals implementing quality assurance in the area of drug demand reduction. The guide provides a broad introduction to quality standards, followed by six practical steps designed for those intending to use or implement quality processes and standards at local, regional or national level. While the guide is primarily targeted at professionals commissioning, planning, funding or providing drug services, it may also be of interest to other stakeholders, such as licensing and inspectorate bodies or recipients of interventions, service users or advocacy groups. The guide describes how quality standards in drug demand reduction have been a priority in the last two EU drugs strategies and action plans and how more countries now report having guidelines and standards for interventions and accreditation systems for service provision. The current EU Drugs Action Plan 2021–2025 (Action 38) calls for services to be guided by the minimum quality standards for drug demand reduction interventions in the EU. ‘One of the main functions of quality assurance is embedding a culture of reflection and continuous improvement in drug services and systems’, says EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel. ‘Quality assurance mechanisms can help professionals work better and improve services for patients, clients, staff and communities, also encouraging user involvement, transparency and accountability. Good quality drug demand reduction interventions, based on evidence and firmly located in human rights, can help improve people’s lives and life chances. At a time when there is more need than ever to ensure continuity in the financing of drug services, well-documented evidence of the quality and evaluation of these services is a must.’ Various types and purposes of quality standards are described in the guide. Some standards are needed for drug services to be accredited (e.g. staff qualifications), while others may regulate the physical space and facilities where a service is provided (e.g. fire safety, infection control, medicines management). And while some cover the overall outcome that a service or system aims to achieve (e.g. respect for human rights, privacy), others include recommendations for concrete actions (e.g. auditing). Six steps The manual identifies the following six steps to consider when implementing quality assurance processes and standards: Diagnosis: What is the problem the quality assurance project will address? Scoping: What are the goals and who to involve? Mapping and selection: What standards apply and how can we verify them? Assessing systems and services: How to evaluate Drafting an improvement plan and disseminating results: When, where and to whom to communicate Preparing for the next cycle: How to ensure continuous evaluation 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/six-steps-improve-quality-drug-services-and-systems_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0009	2021-09-10	UNK	In memoriam — His Excellency Dr Jorge Sampaio	 It was with great sadness that the EMCDDA learned today of the passing of His Excellency Dr Jorge Sampaio, former President of the Portuguese Republic. Dr Jorge Sampaio was a highly-esteemed friend of the EMCDDA. He supported the work of the agency for over two decades, particularly in the early days, providing a symbolic, but invaluable, contribution to its development and that of the European drug information system it manages. He will also be remembered for his commitment to tackling the drugs problem and his contribution to shaping drug policy in Portugal and internationally. In the period 1997–2005, Dr Sampaio visited the EMCDDA four times and participated in a number of EMCDDA-related activities: November 1997 — presiding over the launch of the 1997 Annual Report on the State of the Drugs Problem in the European Union; October 1998 — conceiving and promoting the Euro-Ibero American Seminar on ‘Cooperation between the European Union and Latin America in the field of drugs’, held in Oporto with the support of the Portuguese Government, the European Commission and the EMCDDA; February 1999 — visiting the EMCDDA with the President of France, His Excellency Jacques Chirac; November 1999 — visiting the EMCDDA with King Albert II of the Belgians and Queen Paola, accompanied by the First Lady of Portugal; and December 2005 — visiting the EMCDDA for an insight into the latest trends and developments in the drug situation in Europe, and in Portugal in particular. Dr Sampaio also regularly attended diplomatic receptions at the EMCDDA to mark International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking on 26 June. President Sampaio often praised the work of the EMCDDA in offering sound scientific bases to formulate drug policies in the EU, moving away from responses based on ideology to those based on facts. His comment in 2005, ‘We need to know more to make better decisions’, still rings true today. The EMCDDA Director and staff will observe a minute of silence today in Dr Sampaio’s memory. Dr Jorge Sampaio will be greatly missed at the EMCDDA and the Director and staff send their condolences to his wife, former First Lady Maria José Ritta, his family and friends. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/memoriam-jorge-sampaio_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0010	2021-09-09	UNK	New report highlights public health and social risks posed by synthetic cannabinoids in Europe	 Synthetic cannabinoids come under the spotlight today in a new report released by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). Widely available across Europe and highly potent, these substances are placing some users at a ‘high risk of poisoning’, the agency warns. Synthetic cannabinoids are the largest group of new psychoactive substances (NPS) monitored by the EMCDDA through the EU Early Warning System, with 209 detected between 2008 and 2020. They began to appear in Europe in the mid-2000s, in smoking mixtures such as ‘Spice’, and sold as ‘legal’ replacements for cannabis. But it was soon discovered that these potent substances could poison users, who were often inadvertently exposed to high doses (1). In such cases, this led to outbreaks of mass poisonings in parts of Europe, Canada, Russia and the United States. Today’s report describes how synthetic cannabinoids are still used recreationally as ‘legal’ cannabis replacements, but that their low cost and powerful intoxicating effects have led to the availability of a wider range of products (e.g. vaping liquids) and to use by marginalised groups (e.g. high-risk drug users, people in prison or homeless). It also shows how the market in, and use of, synthetic cannabinoids have been linked to social problems, such as violence, bullying and debt. Recent EMCDDA risk assessments of two synthetic cannabinoids — 4F-MDMB-BICA and MDMB-4en-PINACA — reveal how these drugs are increasingly found in prisons, smuggled in via letters, photographs and clothing impregnated with the substances. The new report highlights concerns over these substances being mis-sold as, or used to adulterate, other drugs or products. In particular, it cites synthetic cannabinoids being mis-sold as THC and CBD vaping liquids or being used to adulterate low-THC cannabis products. Users unaware that a product contains synthetic cannabinoids are exposed to higher health risks.  Similar to other NPS, synthetic cannabinoids are shipped as bulk powders from companies in China to Europe, where they are processed into finished products. Reviewing the current body of knowledge on the chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of synthetic cannabinoids in Europe, the report aims to support early-warning and risk-assessment activities and strengthen situational awareness of this group of substances. ‘In the future, it can be expected that synthetic cannabinoids with high potency, and that are easy to synthesise, will continue to be introduced into the market’, states the report. It concludes that, in order to reduce the public health and social threats posed by synthetic cannabinoids, strong early-warning systems are needed in order to detect, assess and respond to emerging threats in a timely manner. Seven synthetic cannabinoids have been the focus of EMCDDA risk assessments and brought under control in the EU since 2016. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/new-report-highlights-public-health-and-social-risks-posed-synthetic-cannabinoids-europe_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0011	2021-09-03	UNK	EMCDDA expert meeting on digital health innovation 	 Recent EMCDDA studies on the impact of COVID-19 containment measures on drug services in Europe highlighted the rapid and widespread adoption of telemedicine and online communication. In some countries, core drug treatment modalities moved online and virtual technologies were used to support more conventional treatment approaches. In line with these developments, the EMCDDA is hosting an expert meeting today dedicated to digital health innovation. In order to monitor the rapid developments unfolding in this area, and to fully understand the potential and challenges of these approaches, there is a need to map, categorise and build a taxonomy of the types of digital interventions currently available. There is also a need to identify inclusion and exclusion criteria to select and, in time, evaluate case studies. The aim of today’s expert meeting is to reach consensus on the taxonomy, criteria and the case studies identified thus far. The digital health taxonomy and examples of practice, are planned to be completed in 2022 and will be accessible through the EMCDDA’s Best Practice Portal. These practical tools aim to facilitate the monitoring of availability of digital health services for drug problems in the future. They will also increase understanding of how digital health innovation can support improvements in the treatment of addiction and in the delivery and organisation of addiction services, in keeping with the resources, infrastructure and legal framework of individual countries. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/emcdda-expert-meeting-digital-health-innovation_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0012	2021-08-31	UNK	International Overdose Awareness Day: EMCDDA answers key questions on drug-related deaths	 How many people die every year in Europe from a drug-related death? Are women and men affected equally? What substances are involved in these fatalities? These are some of the questions answered in the EMCDDA’s ‘Frequently asked questions (FAQs): drug overdose deaths in Europe’, published today to mark International Overdose Awareness Day. The European Drug Report 2021 describes how over 5 100 deaths, involving one or more illicit drug, were reported in the European Union in 2019. This estimate exceeds 5 700 deaths when Turkey and Norway are included. Most overdose deaths in Europe are linked to the use of opioids (heroin or synthetic opioids), although cocaine, other stimulant drugs and medicines also play a role. Effective preventive and response measures exist that would allow many of these deaths to be prevented. These include programmes providing take-home naloxone (the overdose reversal drug) and drug consumption facilities, which ensure a safer drug use environment. The FAQs pull together the most recent data on drug-related deaths in Europe to raise awareness on the nature and scale of the problem. The resource also presents common risk factors for overdose as well as methodologies, references and links to further reading. New trends and developments are illustrated through a range of maps and graphics. The FAQs also focus on two important areas: deaths relating to MDMA (ecstasy) and new psychoactive substances (NPS) across Europe. A recent review on MDMA-related deaths pointed to an increase in the number of these deaths in all countries participating in the study. A second review on NPS-related deaths found that one in six drug-related deaths in Europe involved an NPS in 2017. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: 'Across Europe, overdose is a leading cause of avoidable death among people who use drugs. Most fatalities occur among people in their late thirties and early forties. Today, it is possible to avoid these premature deaths. The EMCDDA contributes to a healthier Europe by helping to improve the quality and delivery of measures to reduce drug-related harm. Our priority is to support the implementation and evaluation of targeted harm-reduction measures. Take-home naloxone and drug consumption rooms are part of a broader portfolio of interventions that reduce harm for people who use drugs. Evidence, innovation and vision are essential to prevent this unacceptable loss of life in Europe every year. As we face unprecedented availability of drugs and increasingly complex patterns of use, we need to do the right thing and to include overdose in our strategies.' The material released today contributes to a better understanding of drug overdoses and responses to them in Europe to support sound policymaking in this area. Addressing drug-related harm and reducing drug-related deaths are priorities enshrined in the new EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan 2021–25. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/international-overdose-awareness-day-emcdda-answers-key-questions-drug-related-deaths_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0013	2021-07-28	UNK	EMCDDA launches new resources to help European countries beat viral hepatitis 	 On World Hepatitis Day, the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) is launching a new set of resources to help European countries meet health targets to eliminate viral hepatitis. The resources, presented in an online toolkit, are part of a wider EMCDDA harm-reduction initiative supporting countries in their efforts to prevent and control infectious diseases among people who inject drugs (PWID). Eliminating hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 is a target set under the UN Sustainable Development Goal on Health (SDG 3) (1). The focus of World Hepatitis Day this year is ‘Hep can't wait!'. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common infectious disease among PWID, being easily transmitted through the sharing of needles and syringes. While HCV antibody prevalence in the EU general population is below 2%, studies conducted among PWID show it can exceed 50%, making this a key target group for programmes to eliminate the virus. Data collected from those entering drug treatment in Europe show HCV testing rates to be low in this group. Today’s toolkit includes an interactive elimination barometer for mapping countries’ progress in eliminating viral hepatitis among PWID and a manual to facilitate a participatory hepatitis diagnostic process at national or local level. It also showcases innovative models of care in some countries that have increased access to HCV testing and treatment through drug services. Interactive hepatitis elimination barometer to help countries map progress The updated interactive version of the EMCDDA’s hepatitis elimination barometer is designed to help countries (EU 27, Turkey and Norway) assess their progress in eliminating viral hepatitis as a public health threat among PWID by 2030. Through this tool, public health workers, policymakers and other interested users can access data to gauge their country’s performance according to 10 epidemiological indicators (2). Users can download data tables and infographics and view which countries have achieved the targets set. Monitoring data suggest that most European countries are lagging behind in meeting goals, underlining the need to scale up access to stigma-free hepatitis prevention, testing and care in this population (3). Step-by-step manual to boost HCV testing and access to care The new EMCDDA manual aims to help improve access to hepatitis C testing and care for PWID via drug services. Hepatitis testing services tend to be mainly located in hospitals or specialist clinics that are often ‘out of reach’ for this group. The manual focuses on bringing HCV screening closer to this population by prioritising testing in harm-reduction and drug treatment settings. Targeted at drug services and at professionals planning and managing infectious diseases, the manual proposes a practical three-step diagnostic process (mapping, consulting, monitoring) involving a variety of stakeholders to identify problems and areas for improvement (4). The manual also presents user-friendly checklists, templates and links to a knowledge questionnaire, designed to help drug service staff refresh their knowledge on viral hepatitis, identify training needs and advise PWID on testing and risks. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘Although preventable and curable, hepatitis C virus infection is highly prevalent among people who inject drugs in Europe, yet HCV testing in this group remains low. Staff working in drug services play a vital role in reaching people at risk of hepatitis infections and in linking them to HCV testing, treatment and care. The EMCDDA hepatitis toolkit provides practical instruments to improve existing practice and help eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat in our communities. Bringing health services to those who need them is part of ensuring a people-centred approach to health’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/emcdda-launches-new-resources-help-european-countries-beat-viral-hepatitis_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0014	2021-07-21	UNK	France: Parliamentary Committee reports on cannabis regulation	 In May 2021, a multidisciplinary committee established by the French Parliament published three reports on cannabis regulation. The reports, totalling 450 pages, address the regulation and impact of three types of cannabis use, namely: medicinal, recreational and use in the context of ‘wellness’ (focusing on cannabidiol (CBD) use). The committee’s work was based on analyses of the situation in countries that have regulated these different types of cannabis use within the European Union and internationally (particularly in North America). The multidisciplinary committee included representatives of six parliamentary commissions (Economic Affairs, Social Affairs, Law, Finance, Cultural and Educational Affairs and Sustainable Development) and comprised around 30 parliamentarians from governing and opposition parties. The group carried out approximately 100 hearings with experts, professionals, researchers, institutional representatives and associations over a period of more than one year. The investigations covered issues related to cannabis and public health and safety, economic development and regional planning, as well as looking at the hemp business sector. The report on medicinal uses of cannabis focuses on the new French experiment on prescribing cannabis products for therapeutic use (a programme that began in March 2021) while also looking ahead to fully implementing the programme, facilitating patient access and allowing the development of a new medical cannabis sector. The report on CBD calls for a broad consideration of all potential legal aspects while recommending an information, evaluation and regulatory system to maintain consumer safety. Lastly, the report on recreational use supports the regulated supply of cannabis while proposing a major national debate on key questions that would ensure state control of the trade and the protection of young people. In response to these proposals, the French government has supported the current experimental programme on prescribing cannabis for therapeutic use. A revision of the legal framework is also currently being studied, which would allow for the sale of low-THC cannabis products while preserving public health and safety. Nevertheless, the French government has reiterated its opposition to the legalisation of recreational cannabis. All reports, as well as the hearings, can be accessed online (in French) on the website of the French Parliament. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/france-parliamentary-committee-reports-cannabis-regulation_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0015	2021-07-08	UNK	In memoriam — Tomáš Zábranský	 It was with great sadness that the EMCDDA learned this week of the passing of its long-term friend and colleague Tomáš Zábranský MD, PhD. Dr Zábranský was a highly-esteemed Czech epidemiologist, who played a key role in developing the country’s drug policy. He was specialised in the epidemiology of blood-borne diseases and mortality among people who use drugs and in the economic evaluation of drug programmes and policies. In recent years, Tomáš served on the EMCDDA Management Board, representing the European Parliament. In the period 1999–2001, Dr Zábranský participated in the establishment of the Czech national focal point — the National Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addictions — and was the main author of the first Annual Report on the State of Drugs in the Czech Republic (2001). He also taught and led research projects at the country’s Centre for Addictology — now the Department of Addictology of the 1st Medical Faculty of Charles University and the General University Hospital in Prague. Dr Zábranský authored over 100 publications in peer-reviewed journals and monographs and two professional books (see scholar.google.cz). He also published on drugs in the print and electronic media and appeared regularly on television and radio. Tomáš will be greatly missed at the EMCDDA and we send our condolences to his family and friends.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/memoriam-tomas-zabransky_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0016	2021-07-07	UNK	EMCDDA Best practice portal update (3/2021)	 Contingency Management – evidence continues to build-up, time to start talking about implementation? According to the just published EMCDDA European Drug Report cocaine is the second most commonly used illicit drug in Europe and the number of people entering treatment for the first time has risen over the last 5 years. Treatments for cocaine use disorders are limited and no pharmacotherapy has been approved in Europe. Current treatment options rely mainly on psychosocial interventions. Numerous meta-analyses have attempted to search for positive treatment outcomes however, none reported improvements among pharmacotherapies, while meta-analyses of psychosocial interventions have reported variable effect sizes. Contingency management (CM) programmes, which comprise positive reinforcement of drug abstinence, have repetitively shown treatment benefits in counter-tendency with the trends above. In our latest update round of the Best Practice Portal (BPP), a very recent review adds yet another confirmation. The study performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of all treatments for cocaine use disorders published over 22 years to examine which treatment approaches, if any, were associated with a reduction in cocaine use. Only contingency management programmes were consistently associated with a significant reduction in urinalysis-confirmed cocaine use. In addition, the results of another meta-analysis found no evidence that adding another formal psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy or motivational enhancement therapy, to contingency management improves the short-term or long-term effects of CM treatment. Contingency management (CM) programmes are also showing positive results with specific target populations such as psychiatric patients. A recent review included in the EMCDDA BPP found a potentially positive effect of CM in psychotic patients with substance use disorders. While evidence is growing, we do not know enough about the implementation of CM interventions: what approaches are being used? How is it funded? What are the obstacles? Time to kick-off research and discussions at the European level! Comorbidity of substance use and mental health disorders New BPP updates highlight the difficulty of finding effective interventions to treat the comorbidity of substance use and mental health disorders. A recent review investigated the effects of psychotherapy to improve mental health and treatment outcomes in patients with comorbid bipolar and substance use disorders without definite conclusions. More promising results were found by another meta-analysis that looked into the pharmacological treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance use disorders. Medications had a small but positive effect in reducing substance use and improving ADHD symptoms. An interesting European initiative on the subject is the SABAA project that is looking at the overlap between autism and addiction. The project aims to identify research gaps and priorities as well as to provide guidance for future work. Party drugs and crime prevention toolkit The European Crime Prevention Network aims to connect at local, national and European level and to promote crime prevention knowledge and practices among the EU Member States. They have recently published a Toolbox on Party drugs and crime that extensively refers to the EMCDDA BPP and provides excellent examples of effective approaches and real-life cases.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/emcdda-best-practice-portal-update-3-2021_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0017	2021-06-30	UNK	News from EU4Monitoring Drugs, an EMCDDA technical cooperation project	 This content was published in the EU4MD update released on 30.06.2021. This update also presents a section on partnerships, annoucements, studies, upcoming events, and a research corner. Focus on: European Drug Report 2021  How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected drug use and supply in Europe? Which drugs are causing the most concern today? What are the latest trends in drug production and trafficking? Find out more in the European Drug Report 2021: Trends and Developments. The report is based on data from 29 countries (EU 27, Turkey and Norway) and delivers the latest overview of the drug situation in Europe This year, the publication takes a new, concise format, opening with sections on: lessons to be learnt from the report, the COVID-19 pandemic and Europe’s drug phenomenon at a glance. These are followed by chapters organised primarily by drug type, offering the latest insights into drug supply, illicit drug use and associated public health challenges. National data sets are also provided across these themes and on key harm-reduction interventions. Available in 24 languages, the publication is an essential resource for developing evidence-based policies and responses. Accompanying the report is the 2021 Statistical Bulletin and a study on new benzodiazepines in Europe. Spotlight on Algeria In April 2021, the Algerian Ministry of Justice organised ‘virtual meetings’ which brought together the EMCDDA staff and national experts from various ministries, law enforcement and health institutions. On the table were discussions on drug policy, responses to prevent trafficking of drugs, ongoing prevention and harm reduction programmes, and the most recent drug-related trends. Ms Nora Benabbas, Research and Synthesis Officer at the Ministry of Justice, is sharing her views about the drug situation in Algeria, highlighting the main challenges and threats the country faces whilst reflecting on successful national efforts and her views on future cooperation with the EU4MD project. What are the main drug-related challenges facing Algeria? In Algeria, drug-related challenges are evolving rapidly. That is why we are reaching out and looking for approaches which allow us to be prepared and to deal effectively with these challenges. Several factors contribute to the complex situation we are facing, such as the country’s geographical location, the security crisis affecting the region, the interlinks between different kinds of transnational organised crime and illegal immigration.  The response measures to reduce drug supply and drug demand as well as the associated risks in Algeria require a significant amount of human and financial resources.What are the current health and security threats related to drugs? Algeria is facing an increasing number of threats to security, public health and sustainable development. The data from law enforcement give us an idea of the type of criminal organisations involved in the drugs trade, the amount of revenue generated from these illicit activities, and drug-related crime rates'. In terms of public health, the number of users arrested and the number of people seeking treatment in specialised centres indicates an increase in drug use. What has been done to address the challenges posed by drugs? The National Office for the Fight against Drugs and Drug Addiction (Office National de Lutte Contre la Drogue et la Toxicomanie, ONLCDT) has developed a National Strategy for the Fight against Drugs. This five-year document sets the objectives and actions that need to be implemented. The strategy addresses the reduction of drug supply by bringing together all the relevant law enforcement actors of the country. It further develops on drug demand reduction by relying on the 14 ministerial departments that are involved in the action. And finally, under harm reduction, the strategy encourages actions by the Ministry of Health and the non-governmental partners. Where and how can the EU4MD project make a difference? The EU4MD project can greatly contribute to achieving our objectives. We welcome training sessions on drug prevention and on the drug supply measures for all our national partners, such as the Ministries of Justice, Health and National Education, ONLCDT, the National Gendarmerie and the National Security and Customs. We are looking forward to receiving technical assistance from the EU4MD project with the implementation of wastewater analysis, the creation of an early warning system and data collection and analysis.   Moroccco: The Government proposes draft law to regulate cannabis for industrial and medical purposes In December 2020, at the UN’s Commission for Narcotic Drugs (CND), countries voted to change aspects of the UN drug control framework. As a result, cannabis and cannabis resin have now been removed from Schedule IV of the 1961 convention that declared it to be particularly dangerous and have no significant therapeutic properties. Morocco had voted in favour of this change. Following this, in April 2021 the Interior Minister of Morocco presented draft law number 13-21 to Parliament, that would establish a national agency to regulate cannabis and the farmers’ cooperatives in the sector (applicants for production permits must be Moroccan nationals and belong to a cooperative). This is strictly aimed at production for industrial and medicinal purposes, there is no intent for recreational purposes here. Most of the draft law appears to focus on producing and selling to foreign medical cannabis consumers; there is little detail on possible domestic medical cannabis consumers. The draft law states that cooperatives could only sell to approved clients, and that any production greater than agreed contracted amounts should be destroyed immediately. It would allow growers to diversify into other products. The draft also establishes several areas for which details would need to be specified by later decrees, such as the areas where production is permitted, annual production quotas, THC limits for industrial cannabis, the varieties of cannabis approved for growing, the specifications of the contracts between cooperatives and buyers. Various offences and penalties are also established for breaches of regulations, up to two years in prison. Some experts have observed the potential economic benefits of producing cannabis for medicinal purposes when an increasing number of EU countries are permitting prescription of such products. Professor Jallal Toufiq, the Head of the National Centre for Drug Abuse Prevention and Research, Director of the Moroccan National Observatory on Drugs and Addictions, Director of the Ar-razi University Psychiatric Hospital and Professor of Psychiatry at the Rabat Faculty of Medicine, who was involved in the revision of the draft law, comments: 'The draft law is about regulating the culture of cannabis exclusive edical, medicinal, scientific and industrial purposes. The cannabis agency will be established, which will bg licences, dispensing authorisations, monitoring seeds import, culture, harvest, stocks, distribution, export among other things.'

EMCDDA_UNK_0018	2021-06-25	UNK	New EMCDDA report underlines need to scale up drug services in prisons	 Current insights and future challenges on drugs and prison in Europe are explored today in a major new study published by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA)(1). Released on the eve of International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking, the report, Prison and drugs in Europe: current and future challenges, takes an in-depth look at a wide range of issues in the prison setting, including drug use and harms, health and social responses and drug supply. It notes that, while, in several European countries, services in prison for people with drug problems have increased, treatment and care options available to this group remain limited and need to be scaled up. On any given day, there are over 856 000 individuals in prison in Europe. People in prison are more likely than their peers in the community to have used drugs, to use drugs regularly or to experience drug-related problems. They also have higher rates of infection of HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and tuberculosis. For those injecting opioids, the risk of dying from a drug overdose increases markedly in the initial period after release. Given that people in prison come from, and eventually return to, the community, interventions delivered in this setting are likely to have a significant impact on overall public health. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: 'It is vital that we have a sound understanding of the patterns and prevalence of drug use among the prison population and identify what kind of responses are available and work best. Often, it is in prison that people who use drugs access health and social services for the first time. This report highlights some of the challenges, but also the opportunities, arising in this setting to intervene and provide support to reduce drug-related harm. It also outlines how EMCDDA tools are helping to strengthen monitoring, exchange best practice and inform countries in their policy decisions and service planning in this area'. The importance of the prison setting for tackling drug problems is underlined in the new EU Drugs Strategy 2021–2025 (2), which includes a strategic priority aimed at addressing the health and social needs of people who use drugs in prison and after release. The EMCDDA has developed a methodological framework to monitor drugs in this setting, including tools such as the European questionnaire on drug use among people in prison (EQDP). Based on data from 30 countries, today’s report presents the latest developments in the field of drugs and prison, identifying knowledge gaps and implications for policy, practice and research. Key findings People who use drugs are over-represented in prison and the prevalence of drug-related problems in this population is substantially higher than in the general population. Women in prison are especially vulnerable and at risk of problem drug use. Although many people stop using drugs when they enter prison, some continue, or start, to use drugs in this setting. Drug use inside prison is indicated by all 11 countries reporting data on this topic. The use of new psychoactive substances (NPS) in prison has been a growing challenge in recent years, particularly the use of synthetic cannabinoids. New technologies are increasingly used to supply drugs to prisons (e.g. deliveries by drone), but are also employed to restrict supply (e.g. new scanning technology to examine the contents of post). People in prison have poorer physical and mental health and social well-being than their peers in the community and a lower life expectancy. While prison conditions can negatively affect the already impaired health of people who use drugs, these are also settings that may provide health services to those previously hard-to-reach. Opioid substitution treatment (OST) is available in prison in 29 of the 30 countries but, in most of the countries, coverage in this setting is low. Access to testing and treatment for infectious diseases is available in most countries, although coverage needs to be expanded. Other harm-reduction interventions (e.g. needle and syringe programmes, take-home naloxone at release from prison) are available in a few countries. Alternatives to coercive sanctions have been implemented in many European countries. Diverting offenders with problem drug use towards rehabilitation may have a number of positive effects (e.g.  avoiding the harmful effects of detention and contributing to reducing the costs of the prison system). Providing equity and continuity of care, as people move between prison and the community, is key to achieving sustainable and effective treatment outcomes; yet this is not achieved in most countries. There is a need to scale up drug-related interventions in prisons, which have proven effective in other settings. While the evidence base is gradually increasing, there is a need for greater data comparability across countries and for more studies on the outcomes of interventions targeting demand as well as supply reduction in prison. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/8/new-emcdda-report-underlines-need-scale-drug-services-in-prisons_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0019	2021-06-22	UNK	Council approves EU Drugs Action Plan 2021–2025	 The Council of the EU (Foreign Affairs) approved on 21 June the EU Drugs Action Plan for 2021–2025. The new plan presents the concrete actions needed to achieve the priorities of the EU Drugs Strategy, adopted in December 2020 (1). The action plan sets out a specific timetable for these actions, a list of responsible parties and a series of indicators to measure effectiveness. The plan was prepared by national and EU representatives on the Council’s Horizontal Working Party on Drugs (HDG) under the Portuguese Presidency of the EU. With the current EU Drugs Strategy, the EU and its Member States reaffirm their commitment to a balanced, evidence-based approach to address the drug phenomenon in Europe, with the preservation of human rights at its core. The strategy draws on lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic in the drugs area and takes a future-oriented approach, promoting research, innovation and foresight to respond more effectively to, and anticipate, forthcoming challenges. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/council-approves-eu-drugs-action-plan-2021-2025_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0020	2021-06-15	UNK	A year in review: General Report of Activities 2020 published today	 Resilience, agility and innovation are among the recurring themes in the latest EMCDDA General Report of Activities, released today. The annual publication — presenting key achievements and governance — relates how the EMCDDA executed its work programme in 2020, a special year marking its 25 years of monitoring, but also the arrival of COVID-19. Despite teleworking and lockdowns, the report describes how the EMCDDA team rose to the challenge of the pandemic and delivered some of its most successful products and services to date, including 35 scientific and corporate publications. Interest in the agency over the 12 months was illustrated by the estimated 1.6 million visitors to the EMCDDA website. Although 2020 began with a clear list of priorities defined by the annual work programme, the organisation had to adapt swiftly to the new reality. The priority, more than ever, was to serve the EMCDDA’s primary customers with timely analyses, such as on the impact of COVID-19 on drug use, services and markets. To that end, 11 new projects (including trendspotting exercises), were launched, and a rich set of resources was produced and disseminated as a result. As crises often bring opportunity, lockdown meant an acceleration of the agency’s plans for digital transformation. In the core business area, highlights included the digital launch of the European Drug Report 2020 with European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson. The agency’s knowledge-transfer offer was enriched in 2020 with a new webinar series, seven of which focused on COVID-19. The EMCDDA’s training and capacity-building activities also went digital, benefitting close to 500 drug professionals (e.g. health practitioners, law enforcement officers and policymakers). Meanwhile, at corporate level, a mobility transformation programme began, designed to equip staff with mobile workstations to help boost flexibility and efficiency during remote or hybrid working. Many other highlights are presented in today’s report, including: enhanced partnerships, in particular with the Reitox network of national focal points; funding for a bilateral technical assistance project with Georgia; adoption of the EU drugs strategy for 2021–2025, with technical input from the EMCDDA; and the successful implementation of the 2020 Roadmap of the EMCDDA Strategy 2025. In a set of Spotlight videos, released in the run-up to the report launch, members of the EMCDDA team share some of their highlights of this extraordinary year. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/general-report-activities-2020-published-today_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0021	2021-06-09	UNK	European drug market proves resilient to COVID-19 disruption 	 Today, the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) publishes its European Drug Report 2021: Trends and Developments, the latest annual review of the drug situation in Europe (1). Based on data from 29 countries (EU 27, Turkey and Norway), the report offers new insights into the health and security implications of a complex and evolving drugs problem and of a drug market resilient to COVID-19 disruption. The report warns of the risks to public health posed by the availability and use of a wider range of substances, often of high potency or purity. It also describes how organised crime groups have intensified illegal drug production inside Europe to evade anti-trafficking measures, creating environmental, health and security risks. Drawing on the latest EMCDDA rapid assessment study, the report explores the recent effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on drug markets, use and services (2). European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson says: ‘Drugs are a persistent and ever-present threat, affecting the lives of millions. The European Drug Report 2021 provides the latest evidence on this vital issue, which corrupts the fabric of our society, fuelling violence and risking the health and security of our citizens. I am particularly concerned by the highly pure and potent substances available on our streets and online and by the 46 new drugs detected in the EU in 2020 alone. With the new EU strategies on security and on drugs, our Member States will have robust tools to address this emergency through a balanced approach, tackling both supply and demand, supported by the EMCDDA.’ EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel adds: ‘The European Drug Report 2021 illustrates just how much the drug situation has changed over the past 25 years, with drugs now a highly pervasive problem, impacting across all major policy areas. We are witnessing a dynamic and adaptive drug market, resilient to COVID-19 restrictions. We are also seeing patterns of drug use that are increasingly complex, as consumers are exposed to a wider range of highly potent natural and synthetic substances. We need urgently to recognise that, not only is a wider variety of people now personally experiencing drug problems, but these problems are impacting on our communities in a wider variety of ways. This is why I believe it is crucial, across the areas of social, health and security policy, to develop the evidence-based and integrated responses envisioned by the new EU Drugs Strategy'. COVID-19: what impact on drug supply and use? A resilient and more digitally-enabled drug market — Presenting findings from the latest EMCDDA trendspotter study, today’s report illustrates how the drug market continues to adjust to COVID-19 disruption, as drug traffickers adapt to travel restrictions and border closures. At wholesale level, this is reflected in some changes in trafficking routes and methods, with more reliance on smuggling via intermodal containers and commercial supply chains and less reliance on the use of human couriers. Cannabis cultivation and synthetic drug production within the EU appear stable at pre-pandemic levels, with no decline seen in the detection of production sites. Although street-based retail drug markets were disrupted during the early lockdowns, and some localised shortages reported, drug sellers and buyers adapted by increasing their use of encrypted messaging services, social media apps, online sources and mail and home delivery services. This draws attention to whether a long-term impact of the pandemic could be the further digitalisation of drug markets. From nightlife to homelife — Evidence shows that, in the early lockdown periods, there was less consumer interest in substances usually associated with recreational events (e.g., MDMA) as people stayed at home. However, analysis of wastewater samples (available for some European cities) suggests that levels of use of most drugs bounced back as restrictions on movement, travel and social gatherings were eased in summer 2020. Among the worrying developments linked to the pandemic are signs of a possible increase in crack cocaine availability and use in some countries. Benzodiazepines in the spotlight — Specific concerns are raised around the misuse of benzodiazepines, either diverted from therapeutic use or not licenced for medical use in Europe. A rise in use of these drugs is seen among high-risk drug users, prisoners and some groups of recreational drug users, potentially reflecting the high availability and low cost of these substances and pandemic-related mental health issues. Published alongside today’s report is an EMCDDA study on the risks of uncontrolled ‘new benzodiazepines’ appearing on the NPS market, which have been linked to poisonings and deaths (3). European Drug Report 2021: key findings Cannabis use remains stable at high levels, but increased THC content raises health concerns — Rise observed in the THC content of cannabis resin (average range: 20%–28%). Health alerts warn of cannabis adulterated with highly-potent synthetic cannabinoids. Record cocaine seizures, a worrying signal of potential for increased health harms — A record 213 tonnes were seized in 2019 (up from 177 tonnes in 2018). Cocaine purity has increased and more people are entering treatment for the first time. Preliminary seizure data in 2020 suggest availability has not declined in the pandemic. Stable amphetamine demand makes domestic production near consumers profitable — Alongside the dismantling of production facilities in 2019, chemicals used to manufacture amphetamine were also seized in the EU, including 14 500 litres of BMK and 31 tonnes of MAPA (up from 7 tonnes in 2018). Methamphetamine production and trafficking highlight potential for increased use in Europe — Both large-scale and smaller production facilities are being detected in Europe and large quantities of the drug are being transhipped through the EU to other markets.  Risks to health from supply of high-strength MDMA products — In addition to increases in the average MDMA content in tablets and the purity of powders, products with very high levels of MDMA are also being detected. Preliminary data from 2020 suggest there was less interest in this drug during periods of lockdown. Harmful potent new psychoactive substances continue to emerge — Among these are new synthetic cannabinoids and new synthetic opioids. A total of 46 new psychoactive substances (NPS) were reported for the first time in Europe in 2020, bringing the total number monitored by EMCDDA to 830. Are less commonly used drugs posing increasing challenges for public health? — These drugs include hallucinogens, ketamine and GHB. Worryingly, intensive patterns of use are reported in some settings. Large heroin seizures signal potential for increased use and harms — Large volumes of heroin are still being seized in the EU (7.9 tonnes in 2019), raising concerns around the possible impact on levels of use. Organised crime groups intensify illegal drug production within Europe — A total of 370 illegal laboratories were dismantled in 2019. Drug law offences increase, with cannabis possession and supply predominant — An estimated 1.5 million drug law offences were reported in the EU in 2019; 82% were related to use or possession for personal use. First-time treatment clients for heroin use continue to inject less — Although injecting drug use has been declining in Europe for the past decade, it remains a major cause of drug-related harms. Scaling up treatment and prevention is required to reach HIV and HCV Sustainable Development Goals — Increased access to integrated testing and treatment services is an important part of reaching targets. Overdose deaths driven by opioids and other drugs highlight need for service development — High-risk substance use and polydrug use continue to fuel drug-induced deaths in Europe. Chair of the EMCDDA Management Board Laura d’Arrigo concludes: ‘As Europe’s drug problems continue to evolve, so too must Europe’s response to them. The COVID-19 crisis has shown us the value of information that is scientific, evidence-based and comparable across countries. Today’s report provides a timely analysis to help decision-makers keep pace with new trends and developments and identify areas requiring rapid action. The new EU Drugs Strategy not only defines for us the way forward but will further reinforce our capacity to act concertedly to protect the health, well-being and security of EU citizens’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/7/european-drug-report-2021-highlights_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0022	2021-06-09	UNK	New report highlights public health risks and increasing availability of ‘designer benzodiazepines’ in Europe	 New benzodiazepines, which are not controlled by international drug laws, come under the spotlight today in a new report released by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) (1). Often marketed as ‘designer benzodiazepines’, these substances are sold as ‘legal’ replacements for controlled benzodiazepines and are becoming increasingly available in Europe. They are monitored by the agency as new psychoactive substances (NPS) through the EU Early Warning System (EWS). The EMCDDA currently monitors 30 new benzodiazepines, over 80% of which were detected for the first time between 2014 and 2020. Despite this relatively large number, the new benzodiazepine market in Europe is currently dominated by etizolam and flualprazolam — although this may change, as both substances were placed under international control in November 2020. In 2019, 1 240 seizures of new benzodiazepines were reported by the EU Member States (around 5% of NPS seizures). Initially, the substances were sold as ‘legal highs’ or ‘research chemicals’ under their own names (e.g. phenazepam, pyrazolam). While this continues to be the case, increasingly, they are also used by criminal groups to manufacture fake versions of commonly prescribed benzodiazepine medicines (e.g. Valium®, Xanax®), which are then sold on the illicit market. Users may be unaware of the substances or doses they are taking, increasing the risk of severe poisoning, particularly if consumed with alcohol or other sedatives. As some new benzodiazepines (e.g. flualprazolam and etizolam) are placed under control, there is a risk that other substances will take their place. One possibility is the re-emergence of flubromazolam and deschloroetizolam, which were first notified in Europe in 2014. ‘New benzodiazepines have firmly established themselves on the new drugs market in Europe’, says EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel. ‘It is likely that more substances from this group will continue to appear as users seek new drug experiences or alternatives to unavailable prescription medicines. Drugs today are everywhere and the boundaries between what is licit and illicit are increasingly blurred. Faced with a complex market and high demand, we must strengthen our ability to detect, assess and respond to new benzodiazepines and the public health and social harms they cause’. An increase in insomnia and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic may lead more people to self-medicate with new benzodiazepines, or inadvertently use fake benzodiazepine medicines. Similar to other NPS, some new benzodiazepines appear to be shipped from companies in China as bulk powders to Europe, where they are processed into finished products (e.g., tablets, capsules, blotters, and e-liquids for vaping). Produced by licensed pharmaceutical companies, benzodiazepines are the most widely prescribed group of medicines in the world and are used to treat a range of conditions (e.g.  anxiety, insomnia, epilepsy, alcohol withdrawal). In most countries, benzodiazepines authorised as medicines are controlled under drug control laws and available by prescription only. This is in line with the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, which currently controls 38 benzodiazepines.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/6/report-highlights-public-health-risks-and-increasing-availability-designer-benzodiazepines-europe_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0023	2021-06-09	UNK	Speech delivered by Laura d’Arrigo, Chair of the EMCDDA Management Board, on the launch of the European Drug Report 2021	 Since early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on the way in which we live. Countries in Europe, and around the world, have had to introduce unprecedented measures to protect public health. All aspects of the drug phenomenon in Europe — including production, trafficking, distribution and use — have also been affected by the pandemic. The European Drug Report 2021 this year provides the latest overview of these developments. Several indicators suggest that the availability of illicit drugs in Europe is very high. The interception of a growing number of shipments of cocaine, cannabis and, to a lesser extent, heroin, reveals the worrying fact that organised crime groups are infiltrating Europe and have adapted rapidly to restrictions linked to the pandemic. Europe has also become an active area for the production of illicit drugs, notably synthetic drugs destined for European and global markets. Online platforms, whether on the surface or dark web, are increasingly exploited by drug traffickers. The growing complexity of the drug market also poses new challenges: the availability and use of a wider range of substances, often of high potency and purity, can present greater risks to public health. Therefore, it is even more important today that we join forces, at European and international level, to identify changing trafficking methods and routes, to rapidly detect new substances appearing on the market, to improve our knowledge of consumption patterns and associated risks and to provide adequate drug services for all those in need. But, equally, we need to work to prevent substance use, notably by reinforcing young people’s psychosocial skills, their critical spirit, their autonomy and their ability to resist when offered these products. The new EU Drugs Strategy 2021–2025 provides a robust and comprehensive framework for concerted action to protect and improve public health and wellbeing and to offer a high level of security. It reaffirms the commitment of the EU to a balanced, integrated and science-based approach to a complex drug phenomenon. I welcome the fact that the new strategy fully recognises the important role of the EMCDDA both in providing timely evidence to inform policymaking across the Member States and in offering support through early warning, threat and risk assessment, research, innovation and foresight. The EMCDDA is thus a precious tool, both for decision-makers and for professionals. It enables us to tackle our own experiences and identify effective methods and practices that can be usefully adapted to other contexts. I would like to convey my special thanks to the EMCDDA Director and to all of his staff for this high-quality report, once again produced in a difficult context. My thanks also go to the national focal points, to the EMCDDA Scientific Committee, and to all national, European and international partners who helped enrich this analysis. I salute their commitment. The challenges continue to evolve and so must our common response. The work of the EMCDDA is crucial to ensure that drug and addiction policies are founded on the best possible analysis and, therefore, contribute to safeguarding the health and security of European citizens. Today’s report shows how timely and scientific information are critical for keeping pace with new threats and developments and for identifying areas requiring rapid action. This is the clear added value that the EMCDDA brings to Europe, and that should be reinforced in the years to come. Thank you for your attention. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/written-speech-chair-emcdda-management-board-laura-darrigo_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0024	2021-06-09	UNK	What are the lessons to be learnt from the European Drug Report 2021?	 The new EU Drugs Strategy 2021–25 makes explicit that the European response to drugs should be evidence-based and delivered through a balanced and integrated approach, which ultimately must be judged on its impact on the health, safety and wellbeing of our citizens. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is tasked with helping to provide the evidence needed to ensure that European policies and actions on drugs are effective, well-targeted and responsive to new threats and challenges. The European Drug Report 2021, launched today, arrives at a difficult time for meeting this objective, as the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted greatly on all areas of life, including the drug situation and our ability to monitor it. I am therefore extremely pleased that we can still provide the detailed analysis presented in this report, which includes an early assessment of the effect of the pandemic on drug markets and drug use. However, I also believe the value of our work is not simply delivered through accurately documenting past events. We also need to look forward and consider what lessons emerge from the findings of the report in order to ensure that we continue in the future to provide the relevant and timely information required to keep our policies and actions commensurate with the growing challenges we face in the drugs area. In 2019, the EMCDDA conducted, with its stakeholders, a foresight and horizon-scanning exercise to increase our awareness of how the evolution of the drug situation may impact on our work. Among the overarching conclusions of this work was that many of the factors that would shape the drug problems of the future were external ones. Globalisation, developments in information technology, demographic shifts, alongside issues like climate change and human migration, are likely to have important implications for the future drug problems we face. We already see this, as both the drug market and patterns of drug use are becoming ever more dynamic, complex and globally connected. This has made us reflect on the need for more timely reporting, and to consider if, both the data sources we use, and the targets we select for our analysis, are sufficient to meet both current and future policy development needs. What we did not expect was that the events of 2020 would demonstrate so profoundly the importance of this reflection. Within a few weeks, we needed to reorientate our work to support our stakeholders by providing enhanced resources for sharing information and best practices. The speed of developments required us to recognise that this could only be achieved through a more interactive model for knowledge co-production. I am proud of the work of the EMCDDA during this period, but I recognise that this was only possible because of the input we received from stakeholders across Europe. Particularly important was the possibility provided by our Reitox network of national focal points to engage in an ongoing conversation on national responses to the pandemic. This highlighted the value of sharing experiences and preliminary information when there is a need for rapid action. Beyond this, we also launched a series of trendspotter studies to collate qualitative and emerging quantitative data to provide a near real-time complementary data source to accompany our routine monitoring information. The latest insights from our third COVID-19 trendspotter, published recently, are summarised in the report. These results are preliminary, but they help us identify some of the possible longer-term effects of the pandemic on drug markets, drug use and our responses. Despite interdiction efforts, all our routine indicators suggest that, at the beginning of 2020, the European drug market was characterised by the widespread availability of a diverse range of drugs of increasingly high purity or potency. This is illustrated by the large seizures of cocaine and other drugs we observed during 2020. We can also see from a range of indicators that patterns of use are becoming more complex, with people who use drugs being presented with a greater selection of substances. This is creating various health harms, as a result of the use of more novel substances or from the interaction of the effects when multiple substances are used in combination. This convinces me that we need to invest more in understanding the implications of patterns of polydrug use and how they can increase harm. An example of this is visible in the growing concerns around the misuse of benzodiazepines diverted from therapeutic use or appearing as new benzodiazepines on the new psychoactive substances market. These substances can be harmful in themselves but when combined with opioids or alcohol they also increase the risk of overdose, though their role may go undetected. This kind of polydrug use, and more generally the growing importance of synthetic substances, highlights the urgent need to further develop forensic and toxicological resources if we are to better understand and respond to the increasingly complex drug problems we face today. As you will see from the data presented in the report, cannabis is another area in which the issues we face are growing in complexity, which is only likely to increase in the future. We are seeing, partly because of developments outside of the European Union, more forms of cannabis appearing and new ways of consuming them emerging. Within Europe, we also see concerns growing about the availability of high-potency products on the one hand, and how to respond to low-THC products on the other hand. Synthetic cannabinoids, and the health risks they pose, only complicate this picture further, as evidenced by deaths reported in 2020 linked to the use of these substances and the fact that we have recently had to release public health alerts warning of the presence on the market of natural cannabis products adulterated with highly potent synthetic cannabinoids. I believe that providing policymakers with the up-to-date and scientifically robust information they need in this area will be of growing importance for the work of the EMCDDA over the coming years. Drug production and trafficking appears to have adapted rapidly to pandemic-related restrictions, and we have seen little evidence of any major disruptions in supply. Social distancing measures may have affected retail drug dealing, but this appears to have led to a greater adoption of new technologies to facilitate drug distribution, possibly accelerating the trend we have seen in recent years, where the market is becoming increasingly digitally enabled. More positively, technology has also created opportunities for responding to drug problems. We can see this in the way that many drug services in Europe have also demonstrated resilience by adopting telemedicine approaches to allow them to continue offering support to people who use drugs during this difficult period. The EMCDDA is also increasingly incorporating innovative approaches to monitoring and developing new data sources that complement established indicators. This is essential, in my view, if we are to keep pace with the changes we are seeing and meet our stakeholders’ needs by reporting on the role drugs play in exacerbating problems across a broader set of policy areas. Digitalisation also offers us greater opportunities, I believe, in the future for working more dynamically and interactively with our stakeholders to ensure that our policies and actions in the drugs area are informed by a sound understanding of contemporary drug problems and shaped by a shared understanding of the most effective responses. In conclusion, the data provided by the European Drug Report 2021 illustrate how much the drug situation has changed over the last 25 years. The events of the past year also highlight a growing need to respond rapidly, and this requires us to increase our capacity for the early identification of threats emerging from an increasingly dynamic and adaptive drug market. Today, drugs have become a much more pervasive problem, one that impacts in some way across all major policy areas. We also see diversification, both in the products available and the people who use them. To ensure we are well-prepared to meet the future consequences of this hyper-availability, we need urgently to recognise that not only is a wider variety of people now personally experiencing drug problems, but drug problems are impacting on our communities in a wider variety of ways. This is why I believe it is crucial, across the areas of social, health and security policy, to develop the evidence-based and integrated responses envisioned by the new EU drugs strategy.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/2/lessons-to-be-learnt-from-the-european-drug-report-2021_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0026	2021-05-18	UNK	Latest wastewater data reveal drug-taking habits in a record 82 European cities 	 The 2020 findings from the largest European project in the science of wastewater analysis are revealed today in Wastewater analysis and drugs — a European multi-city study, published by the Europe-wide SCORE group, in association with the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) (1)(2). The project analysed wastewater in 82 European cities (18 countries) to explore the drug-taking behaviours of their inhabitants. This is the highest number of cities participating to date, despite COVID-19 disruption in the study period concerned. While the 2019 results pointed to an overall rise in the detection of stimulants, the 2020 findings are more mixed, with diverse geographical and temporal patterns seen across the study locations. Samples in 2020 may have been collected during lockdowns, which could have impacted on drug availability and patterns of use. From Zagreb to Lisbon and Helsinki to Istanbul, the study analysed daily wastewater samples in the catchment areas of wastewater treatment plants over a one-week period between March and May 2020. Wastewater from some 25 million people was analysed for traces of four illicit stimulant drugs (cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA/ecstasy) as well as cannabis. The SCORE group has been conducting annual wastewater monitoring campaigns since 2011, when 19 cities participated. Alexis Goosdeel, EMCDDA Director says: ‘Over the last decade, wastewater analysis has established itself as an important tool for monitoring illicit drug use in Europe. By delivering almost real-time data on consumption patterns, both geographically and over time, this novel approach can offer a valuable snapshot of drug use in key cities and locations and an insight into emerging changes in behaviour. As we look ahead, today’s study explores the exciting potential for wastewater research in the future, from identifying new psychoactive substances to assessing the outcome of interventions targeting drug supply’. Key findings 2020 MDMA: The highest residues of MDMA were found in cities in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Slovenia. Almost half of the cities with data for 2020 and 2019 (24 of 49) reported a decrease in detections in 2020, possibly due to the closure of nightlife venues during the pandemic, where this drug is often consumed. Cocaine: Cocaine residues in wastewater were highest in western and southern European cities, particularly in Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. Very low levels were found in the majority of eastern European cities, although some increases are seen in the latest data. Overall, the picture is mixed: of the 49 cities with data for 2020 and 2019, 19 reported increases and 16 decreases. Amphetamine: The level of amphetamine residues varied considerably across the cities, with the highest reported in cities in the north and east of Europe and much lower levels in cities in the south. Of the 48 cities with data for 2019 and 2020, 20 cities reported an increase and 19 a decrease. Methamphetamine: Traditionally concentrated in Czechia and Slovakia, this drug is now present in Cyprus, the east of Germany, Spain and several northern European countries (e.g. Denmark, Lithuania, Finland, Norway). Unlike the other three stimulants, residues were very low to negligible in most locations. Cannabis: The highest loads of the cannabis metabolite (THC-COOH) were found in cities in Croatia, France and the Netherlands. Use appears to have been less affected by COVID-19 lockdowns than other drugs. City variations: The study revealed differences between cities in the same country, which may be partly explained by their different social and demographic characteristics (age distribution, universities, nightlife). In most countries with multiple study sites, residues were higher in large cities compared to smaller locations for three of the stimulants. No such differences were detected for amphetamine and cannabis. Weekly patterns: Wastewater analysis can detect fluctuations in weekly patterns of drug use. More than three-quarters of the cities showed higher residues of the typically recreational drugs, cocaine and MDMA, at the weekend (Fri–Mon) than on weekdays, despite much of the night-time economy being closed in Europe in 2020. In contrast, residues of the other three drugs were distributed more evenly throughout the week. New interactive features Today’s study includes an innovative interactive map allowing the user to look at geographical and temporal patterns and to zoom in on results per city and per drug. This interactive feature has been redesigned this year to be more accessible and user-friendly and to perform better on mobile and desktop devices. For the first time, and in line with the EMCDDA’s commitment to open data, all of the source tables behind the tool can be easily downloaded by researchers, data journalists or anyone interested in using the data in their work.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/4/latest-wastewater-data-reveal-drug-taking-habits-record-82-european-cities_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0027	2021-05-04	UNK	Legalisation of cannabis in 3 US states: New York, Virginia, New Mexico	 In the last few weeks, three US states have legalised cannabis for recreational purposes, all via the legislature and not via public ballots. New York, Virginia and New Mexico will begin by permitting cannabis use in private and home cultivation, for adults aged over 21 (out of sight and away from children). The intention is to introduce commercial markets in the coming years, after detailed regulatory requirements are agreed. For these three states, there is more emphasis on social justice than in previous legalisation frameworks in the United States. All three have agreed to automatic removal of minor cannabis convictions from the records of previous offenders, and New York and Virginia have established funds to support individuals and communities who were previously disadvantaged by drug law enforcement. The laws of New York and New Mexico also contain two specific aspects. The first is to provide for the establishment of specific consumption areas, such as cafes; these areas allow consumption by people who are not permitted to consume in their rented accommodation (tenancy agreements usually prohibit drug use) and who cannot find space to legally consume in public. The second is to allow for delivery to consumers, perhaps reflecting the post-COVID retail world. New York State has also introduced taxation that is dependent on THC content and product type, permitting the state to regulate different types of product according to their effects on health.

EMCDDA_UNK_0028	2021-05-03	UNK	EMCDDA launches its first bilateral technical cooperation project with Georgia 	 The EMCDDA has launched today its first bilateral technical cooperation project with Georgia aimed at enhancing national responses to drug-related health and security threats. The EMCDDA4Georgia project (EMCDDA4GE) will focus primarily on knowledge transfer and capacity-building in the areas of drug monitoring, reporting, prevention and treatment. The EMCDDA and Georgia have a long tradition of cooperation, illustrated, among others, by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the agency and the Georgian Ministry of Justice in 2015. EMCDDA4GE will build on the achievements and results of previous, and current, EMCDDA technical cooperation projects involving the country (such as EU4MD) as well as on the ongoing EU-funded project currently implemented in Georgia (EU-ACT). The new project will further familiarise the agency’s Georgian partners with the EU drug information system and its methodologies and tools, as well as with the transfer of best practice in the area of interventions. It will also support the strengthening of the newly-created National Drug Observatory. EMCDDA4GE will be implemented by the EMCDDA under the supervision of the Delegation of the EU in Georgia. The agency will also proactively engage during the project with the European Commission (DG NEAR and DG HOME) and with the European External Action Service (EEAS).

EMCDDA_UNK_0029	2021-04-30	UNK	EMCDDA releases third trendspotter study on COVID-19 and drugs	 In the third in its series of rapid ‘trendspotter’ studies, the EMCDDA explores the impact of COVID-19 on the drug situation and responses to it. Revisiting and reviewing findings from two studies in 2020 on the effects of the pandemic on drug use and services, the report identifies new trends and developments which may have implications for policy and practice. The report explores the situation in the EU Member States from June 2020 to February 2021, particularly changes in drug markets, patterns of use, harms and drug services, both in the community and in prisons. The EMCDDA’s trendspotter methodology examines emerging drug-related trends by rapidly collecting and triangulating data from a variety of sources to allow for timely assessments of topics of concern. Specifically, for this COVID-19 impact study, the methodology was adapted to suit online investigation, taking into account the national emergency restrictions on both the EMCDDA team and the study participants. The study was designed to be carried out in successive waves. The new analysis draws on a range of sources, including: three online surveys, eight virtual facilitated groups, data and literature reviews. Key findings Drug market The drug market proved to be ‘remarkably resilient’ to disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the detection of synthetic drug production sites and levels of cannabis cultivation in European countries appearing relatively stable. There were few indications that the pandemic made much impact on Europe’s cocaine market, with large seizures of the drug continuing into 2021. At wholesale level, some changes in routes and methods were reported, with more reliance on smuggling via intermodal containers and commercial supply chains. At retail market level, following disruption in early lockdowns, drug sellers and buyers adapted by increasing their use of encrypted messaging services, social media apps, online sources and mail and home delivery services. Drug use and potential harms Study findings indicate a reduced consumer interest in drugs usually associated with recreational events (e.g., MDMA), and some increased interest in drugs more associated with solitary or home use. Despite some reductions during the initial lockdown period, the easing of restrictions during the summer period was associated with a rebound in stimulant drug use (including MDMA, cocaine and amphetamine) in some cities. There were also reports of increased experimentation with psychedelic and dissociative drugs, including LSD, 2C-B, ketamine and GHB. Some countries reported an increase in crack cocaine availability and use. There were increasing reports of cannabis adulterated with highly potent synthetic cannabinoids (some outbreaks of acute harms and deaths associated with these substances). Specific concerns were also raised about the misuse of benzodiazepines, either diverted from therapeutic uses or not licensed for medical use. Increased use was reported among high-risk drug users, people in prison and recreational drug users. Services Drug services across Europe, including low-threshold services, drug consumption rooms and residential and outpatient treatment services, returned to operation in most countries from June 2020 (with strict COVID-19 measures and reduced capacity). Overall, drug services reported rapid adaptation, innovation and increased flexibility. While many professionals reported positive experiences of moving services online, some concerns were raised about reduced accessibility of telemedicine for certain client groups and associated challenges for treatment retention. Repeated school closures and online schooling proved challenging for implementing prevention and health-promoting programmes during the pandemic. In most European countries, the provision of drug services in prisons remained reduced throughout 2020, although efforts were made to maintain the provision of opioid substitution treatment as well as testing and treatment for infectious diseases.   Sign up to receive our news releases. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/emcdda-releases-third-trendspotter-study-on-covid-19-and-drugs_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0030	2021-04-23	UNK	Austrian Minister for the EU and Constitution visits the EMCDDA	 Austrian Federal Minister for the European Union and Constitution Karoline Edtstadler, visits the EMCDDA today where she will meet EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel. The Minister will receive a briefing on the agency’s ongoing activities under EMCDDA Strategy 2025 and how it contributes to a healthier and more secure Europe through better-informed drug policy and action. Federal Minister Edtstadler, took up her position in January 2020 and is paying her first visit to the EMCDDA. The Minister will be accompanied by a delegation of Austrian dignitaries, including Austrian Ambassador to Portugal, Robert Zischg. Speaking ahead of the visit, Alexis Goosdeel said: ‘I am delighted to welcome Federal Minister Edtstadler and her delegation to the EMCDDA today. Austria is one of the agency’s longest-standing members and its strong drug monitoring capacity provides a firm evidence base on the national drug situation in the European context. We look forward to continued cooperation with our Austrian partners as we build on the achievements of the past 25 years and face the challenges ahead’. Austria has been a member of the EMCDDA since 1995 and sits on its Management Board. Current representative for Austria, Franz Pietsch (Federal Ministry of Health), serves in the position of Vice-Chair of the Board. Austria contributes data to the agency, among others, via the Reitox network of national focal points. The Austrian national focal point is located at the Austrian Public Health Institute (Gesundheit Österreich GmbH), a public body funded by the Federal Ministry of Health. It was one of the first focal points to be EMCDDA certified on 31 March 2020. Following the visit to the EMCDDA, the Minister will proceed to the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/austrian-minister-eu-and-constitution-visits-emcdda_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0031	2021-04-16	UNK	News from EU4Monitoring Drugs, an EMCDDA technical cooperation project	 This content was published in the EU4MD update released on 16.04.2021. This update also presents a section on partnerships, annoucements, studies, upcoming events, and a research corner. Focus on: Methamphetamine trade in Iran This report builds on the study published by the EMCDDA on the Afghan methamphetamine trade and addresses the threats posed by Iran’s potential emergence as a transhipment point for Afghan methamphetamine, as suggested by a reported increase of methamphetamine seizures originating from Iran and bound for countries in Southeast Asia and Oceania. The report is the result of research conducted under the EU4Monitoring Drugs (EU4MD) project, funded by the European Commission. Iran is a key transhipment point for illicit drugs along the Balkan and Southern trafficking routes. Seizures of methamphetamine, which is known locally as ‘shisheh’ (meaning ‘glass’ in Persian), increased dramatically between March 2019 and March 2020, with almost 17 tonnes seized and a 208% increase compared with the previous year. The study is based on interviews with Iranian drug treatment practitioners, law enforcement officers, United Nations officials, and key informants involved in drug supply, in combination with an analysis of more than 70 Iranian newspaper articles and several Turkish, Kurdish, and Australian news articles to outline the scale of methamphetamine trafficking from Iran. Spotlight on Lybia What are the main drug-related challenges facing Libya? The drug-related challenges that Libya faces cannot be dissociated from the country’s political and socio-economic situation, which affects the efficiency of our units charged with addressing drugs issues. This situation may also have implications on how our administration can keep the pace required for rapid information exchange, intelligence developments and improving the technical and professional skills of staff. There has been a proliferation of the trade in illicit weapons in the central and southern regions of the country. We have observed that smugglers use more remote areas and opt for routes crossing the desert: these are vast areas requiring control, which is challenging for the administration. In many places, organised crime groups establish close relationships with local communities, which may help and facilitate an on-going illicit trade. Another concern is how the money gained from drug trafficking influences the private sector and the performance of the administration in general. This link between drug trafficking, terrorism and money laundering is particularly problematic for us, especially because we have not yet developed enough investigative capacities in the area of money laundering. Other issues to address are the lack of effective controls on the import and turnover of chemical precursors, unregulated trade in legal goods and weak control mechanisms for air freight and courier companies. We should also remember illegal immigration, boosted by regional and international organised crime groups. The same groups may also be involved in drug trafficking. Rapid changes in the new psychoactive substances appearing on the market, as well as difficulty in adapting laws and control of these substances are factors that contribute to the spread of drugs. Faced with so many concerns, there is no debate on drug-related harms and we see a lot of misinformation in the media. What are the current health and security threats related to drugs? The most common health threats we see associated with drug use in Libya are HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C infections and mental health disorders. In terms of security, our concern is drug-related criminal offences. There are many armed robberies and domestic violence crimes.   What has been done to address the challenges posed by drugs? The Libyan authorities acknowledge the challenges they face, and are continuously adopting measures to address them. I can say in all confidence that international cooperation is one of our priorities. I would like to underline the importance of the cooperation with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in the framework of the EU4Monitoring drugs project. Where and how can the EU4MD project make a difference? We see this project as an opportunity to increase the professional skills of the staff working in my department. We would like to continue exchanging good practices on how to address identified drug-related threats and participate in capacity-building activities and experience-sharing forums offered by the Agency. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/update-eu4monitoring-drugs-project-april_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0032	2021-04-15	UNK	EMCDDA Best practice portal update (2/2021)	 School-based programmes to improve mental health and well-being and reduce risks Adolescents spend a significant part of their lifetime in school and, therefore, this environment plays an important role in their social, emotional and psychological development. Psychological distress can appear during adolescence in the form of mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. It is also manifested in external symptoms including impulsiveness and aggression, which are the later predictors of stress levels and risk behaviours, such as substance use. Schools could serve as a vehicle for the promotion of positive youth development and effective learning.   In our latest Best Practice Portal update, we highlight the results of recent systematic reviews on school interventions addressing the mental health and well-being of young people. School-based multi-component positive psychology interventions aim to improve well-being and mental health and reduce the most common psychological distress indicators (i.e., depression, anxiety and stress) in adolescents. Positive psychology interventions focus on strengthening positive emotions, thoughts and behaviours through activities that can be easily implemented in daily routines. These interventions were found to be effective in improving psychological well-being and reducing depression symptoms. Bullying is a major target for universal prevention given the high prevalence rates, association with increased lifetime prevalence of mental health disorders, and the fact that evidence is emerging which suggests that school anti-bullying interventions have valuable population impact. A recent meta-analysis documented that anti-bulling interventions can be more effective than very established interventions for specific health conditions. Authors were able to calculate the Population Impact Number (PIN), which is the number of people who should be exposed to an intervention in order to prevent one case. They found that, on average, an anti-bullying intervention needs to include 140 pupils to prevent one case of bullying exposure and 107 to improve mental health problems. To put these results into context, 35 450 people need to take aspirin for six months after a first non-haemorrhagic stroke to avoid one death or 324 girls needs to be vaccinated for human papillomavirus to prevent one case of cervical cancer. In the EMCDDA Best Practice Portal, we host a specific registry of evaluated prevention programmes – the Xchange Registry. The following list highlights the Xchange entries rated as beneficial, or likely to be beneficial, school-based programmes aimed at tackling risk behaviours and focusing on life-skills training:     Eigenstandig Werden (Becoming independent): life-skills training with a focus on substance use and bullying     Unplugged - a Comprehensive Social Influence programme for schools: life-skills training with correction of normative beliefs     KiVa (Anti-bullying programme): Combined universal and indicated type of an anti-bullying programme for school children     Olweus Bullying Prevention Programme: a school-wide programme designed to prevent bullying amongst children     IPSY: life skills training with discussions on school context and learning climate E-health in schools Results are still not clear on whether e-health school-based interventions addressing multiple lifestyle risk behaviours have an effect on alcohol and smoking. Multiple health behaviour change interventions target risk factors in combination and are a promising method to improve lifelong health. This approach capitalises on evidence that changing one lifestyle behaviour could increase self-efficacy to improve others. Given that teaching time is often restricted, interventions that simultaneously address multiple risk behaviours are particularly advantageous in school settings. E-health interventions (delivered via the internet, computers, tablets, mobile technology or tele-health) offer increased student engagement, fidelity and scalability. Internet technology is becoming increasingly embedded in school education. The conclusions of the review, included in the BPP, highlight that e-health school-based interventions addressing multiple lifestyle risk behaviours can be effective in improving physical activity, screen time, and fruit and vegetable intake, however, effects are small and only evident immediately after the intervention. No effect was seen for alcohol or smoking. Brief interventions for substance use in teens A new BPP update highlights the positive effects of brief behavioural interventions on alcohol use but not on cannabis. A recent review investigated the effects of brief interventions, including motivational interviewing (MI), psycho-education, and treatment as usual, in adolescents for substance use in adolescents. The results of the meta-analysis confirm the evidence, which was already coming together for adults, that MI reduces heavy alcohol use and alcohol use days also in adolescents. However, it does not reduce cannabis use days. Webinar series The EMCDDA will host a new webinar on the 28 April and it will address the application of science-based strategies in policy- and decision-making at local level. The European Prevention Curriculum (EUPC) includes training for Decision-, Opinion-, and Policy-makers (DOPs) on how to prioritise evidence-based interventions and policies and on how to advocate for them. This represents a paradigm shift from offering guidance (‘let things happen’) to actively promoting change in decision-making (‘make things happen’). Speakers and stakeholders from Belgium, Germany, Estonia and Croatia will gather in conversation around this topic.

EMCDDA_UNK_0033	2021-04-12	UNK	Commissioner Johansson acknowledges value of EMCDDA analysis in informing drug policy	 European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson paid her first visit to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) today during a day of events relating to the fight against organised crime. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel welcomed the Commissioner to the agency for talks on its current priorities and challenges. As Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson is responsible for the EU drugs portfolio, overseeing implementation of the new EU drugs strategy 2021–2025, adopted by the Council of the EU in December 2020. The new strategy, which sets out the political framework and priorities for the EU's drug policy over the next five years, will be accompanied by an action plan presenting concrete measures to achieve these priorities. This plan is currently under preparation and is expected to be adopted under the Portuguese Presidency of the EU in June. Before arriving at the agency, the Commissioner spoke at the the launch of the Europol 2021 Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment (SOCTA) report, to which the EMCDDA contributed. Underlining the value of the EMCDDA as provider of independent, scientific evidence on the drug phenomenon, Commissioner Johansson said: ‘The drug market in the EU is estimated at a minimum of EUR 30 billion per year. We need the EMCDDA’s analysis for informed decision-making on drug policies. EMCDDA data show that the availability and purity of drugs are on the rise. This causes more problems for drug users and leads to deaths. On my first visit to the EMCDDA, I received the most recent picture of the EU drug phenomenon and discussed how to take the agency’s important work forward.’ EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel expressed the agency’s full support for the EU drugs strategy and its commitment to the European balanced approach, addressing both the health and security threats posed by illicit drugs. He said: ‘Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, availability across all drug types has remained high and the economic repercussions of the crisis may see some in our communities becoming more vulnerable to drug problems and drug market involvement. This has raised the stakes, underscoring the importance of protecting EU citizens from drug-related harms. The strength of the agency will lie in its agility and capacity to adapt rapidly to new realities in the future.’ This week, the EMCDDA forms part of the EU delegation at the 64th session of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (Vienna,12–16 April 2021). Alexis Goosdeel will be speaking at side events on the COVID-19 pandemic and its influence on the world drug problem: New challenges and prospects (12 April) and on the EU drugs strategy (13 April) where he will reflect on ‘How to address the complexity of drugs in a post-COVID world.’ Following the visit to the agency, the Commissioner proceeded to the Maritime Analysis and Operation Centre – Narcotics (MAOC-N) to discuss practical cooperation to fight drugs trafficking by sea and air. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/3/european-commissioner-ylva-johansson-visits-eu-drugs-agency-in-lisbon_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0034	2021-03-18	UNK	EMCDDA launches 2021 European Web Survey on Drugs to assess patterns of drug use in over 30 countries	 Do you use drugs? How many? How often? These are among the questions posed in the latest European Web Survey on Drugs, launched today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). Targeted at people, aged 18 and over, who have used drugs, the survey aims to improve understanding of patterns of drug use in Europe and help shape future drug policies and interventions (1). The voluntary, anonymous survey — one of the agency’s targeted ‘leading-edge’ monitoring methods — will run this year in 31 countries and 28 languages (2). As in previous years, it will be promoted nationally by the Reitox focal points and their partners, as well as through targeted social media advertisements. New to this year’s round is the participation of the agency’s partners from the Western Balkans and the European Neighbourhood Policy area through the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA7) and EU4Monitoring Drugs (EU4MD) projects. Web-based surveys have the benefit of reaching people who use drugs directly. They are quick and cheap to set up, provide new data rapidly and can help spot emerging trends. If the same questions are used, along with a rigorous translation process, then these surveys can also allow for cross-national comparisons. The new questionnaire, which will run for six weeks, is structured in modules on: socio-demographics, drug using patterns, access to treatment, access to drugs (amounts usually bought and prices paid) and how COVID-19 has affected patterns of drug use. Its findings will contribute to the emerging knowledge base on drug-using practices in Europe and on the quantities of drugs used. This will help enhance market size estimates at national and European level and contribute to policy development more widely. While web surveys are not representative of the general population, when carefully conducted and combined with traditional data-collection methods, they can help paint a more detailed, realistic and timely picture of drug use and drug markets in Europe. As such, they are a key ingredient in the EMCDDA’s responsiveness to an ever-shifting drugs problem. The survey runs in the following countries: EU: Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czechia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden EU4MD: Georgia, Lebanon, Ukraine IPA7: Albania, Kosovo*, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia Other: Switzerland 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/2/emcdda-launches-2021-european-web-survey-on-drugs_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0035	2021-03-12	UNK	European Commission proposes to control two harmful new psychoactive substances	 Today, the European Commission has proposed to control two harmful new psychoactive substances (NPS) across the European Union. The substances in question — MDMB-4en-PINACA and 4F-MDMB-BICA — are both synthetic cannabinoids, which have been raising health concerns in Europe (1). The proposal to control the substances is based on risk assessments conducted by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in December 2020. MDMB-4en-PINACA and 4F-MDMB-BICA are sold as ‘legal’ replacements for cannabis (or already controlled synthetic cannabinoids) and can pose a high risk of severe poisoning. The substances have been detected in smoking mixtures, powders, liquids (including e-liquids) and paper impregnated with the substance (including blotters). Harmful effects linked to the use of the substances were reported by the EU Member States to the EMCDDA through the EU Early Warning System (EWS). The two risk assessments were conducted by the EMCDDA Scientific Committee on 7 December 2020, with additional experts from the EU Member States, European Commission, Europol, the European Medicines Agency and the EMCDDA. These examined the health and social risks of the substances, as well as international trafficking and the involvement of organised crime (2). At the time of the risk assessments, 12 and 21 deaths with confirmed exposure to MDMB-4en-PINACA and 4F-MDMB-BICA respectively had been reported in the EU. Today’s proposal from the Commission (the adoption of a delegated directive) is based on the latest legislation designed to bring a stronger and faster response to NPS in Europe (3). The delegated directive includes the two substances in the definition of ‘drug’ under EU law (4). The European Parliament and the Council will have two months to analyse the act before it enters into force. Once in force, the Member States will have six months to introduce the relevant national legislation. Of the 35 risk assessments carried out by the EMCDDA, seven have been related to synthetic cannabinoids (5). Products containing synthetic cannabinoids have been available in Europe since around 2006. MDMB-4en-PINACA has been available on the EU drug market since at least 2017 and 4F-MDMB-BICA since March 2020. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/1/european-commission-proposes-control-two-harmful-new-psychoactive-substances_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0036	2021-02-17	UNK	New multi-city syringe study uncovers latest patterns of injecting drug use	 The latest patterns of injecting drug use in a selection of European cities are explored today in a new study from the EMCDDA. The report presents the results of an innovative project investigating the substances used by people who inject drugs, by chemically analysing the content of used syringes (1). The findings, from the agency’s ESCAPE project, are based on two data-collection campaigns carried out in 2018 and 2019. Syringes were collected from street disposal bins (2) and at harm reduction services in eight sentinel European cities: Amsterdam (2019), Budapest (2018–19), Cologne (2018–19), Helsinki (2018–19), Lausanne (2018–19), Oslo (2019), Paris (2018–19) and Vilnius (2019). In this new analysis, the contents of 988 (2018) and 1 330 (2019) used syringes were tested for over 120 drugs (3). Overall, people who inject drugs were seen to use a wide range of substances and the strong differences observed between cities reflect the diversity and complexity of the European drug situation. The report highlights two injecting patterns which are a particular cause for concern, namely: High prevalence of stimulant drugs in the analysed syringes (e.g. cocaine, amphetamines and synthetic cathinones). Stimulant injection can be associated with increased risk of blood-borne virus outbreaks (e.g. HIV, HCV) and requires careful monitoring. Detection of the highly potent opioid carfentanil in a third of syringes from Vilnius (Lithuania), often mixed with methadone. Although the detection of fentanyl and its derivatives was rare in the other participating cities, the very high overdose risk associated with these substances calls for vigilance. Around a third of all syringes were found to contain residues of two or more drugs, highlighting the fact that people who inject drugs often inject more than one psychoactive substance (or are re-using or sharing injecting material). The most frequent combination of drugs was a mix of a stimulant and an opioid. Benzodiazepines were often found in syringes that also contained traces of opioids. By providing local data on patterns of injecting and substances used, the ESCAPE approach can be instrumental in informing local prevention, treatment and harm-reduction strategies. Importantly, it increases understanding of injection practices among people who are not in contact with services, as well as those already receiving interventions. A follow-up analysis, involving 10 European sentinel cities, is currently under way. It will help to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on injecting drug use in the selected cities.

EMCDDA_UNK_0037	2021-02-11	UNK	Maximising access to drug treatment while minimising diversion of medications — new EMCDDA report looks at striking the balance	 Opioid substitution treatment (OST) is a key evidence-based tool used to manage opioid dependence and improve related health and social consequences. Yet increasing reports of the diversion and misuse of the controlled drugs used in this treatment in Europe are a cause for concern. In a new report out today, the EMCDDA highlights the various dimensions of the issue and the importance of balanced policies that maximise access to treatment while minimising diversion and misuse. According to the report: ‘The consequences of the diversion and misuse of prescription OST medications in Europe are a continuing public health concern and require heightened vigilance, particularly in light of the recent opioid epidemics in the United States’. The report looks at how OST is implemented in Europe, the motivations behind diversion and the measures in place to address the problem. Around half of the 1.3 million high-risk opioid users in the EU are estimated to be receiving OST — 660 000 in 2018 — a considerably higher rate than in most other world regions. Provision of OST varies across Europe, being generally higher in the 15 countries that had joined the EU by 1995 and lower in the countries joining since 2004. According to WHO guidelines, OST should be available to all those in need, and treatment programmes should be designed to be as accessible as possible. Evidence shows that OST can bring a number of benefits, such as reducing overdose and blood-borne infections and increasing retention in treatment. However, the report reveals that the demand for specialised treatment related to the misuse of OST medications and the number of deaths associated with these substances have been increasing over the past decade. The vast majority of those seeking help were long-term high-risk opioid users with a history of opioid dependence and past treatment experiences. Available European data show that diverted prescription OST medications (e.g. methadone, buprenorphine) mainly originate from domestic supplies. In Europe, these medications for non-medical use are largely sourced from family and friends (via legitimate medical supply) or from drug dealers. Opioid users in treatment may also stray from clinical guidance and stockpile their prescribed OST medication for later personal use. And illegitimate medical sourcing (e.g. ‘doctor shopping’, prescription fraud) is often observed in countries with limited patient registration systems. Cross-border trafficking and the internet appear to play a lesser role in supply. The most common motivation cited for misusing prescribed and non-prescribed OST medications was the intended therapeutic purpose: to ease withdrawal and maintain abstinence. Lack of access to OST and lower prices (than heroin) were also mentioned, as was ‘topping up’ insufficient prescribed doses. The latter highlights the issue that sub-optimal prescribing practices may inadvertently contribute to increased diversion. European countries have implemented a number of strategies to control and prevent the diversion of OST medications, such as training for clinicians and patients and central registers of those receiving OST. Yet the report cautions against ‘one-size-fits-all’ policies, underlining the need for country-specific anti-diversion measures that address specific national causes of the problem. The report concludes: ‘It is a challenge for, but also a responsibility of, the stakeholders involved in the provision of OST to ensure the availability and accessibility of this effective treatment while developing and implementing effective anti-diversion policies. Therefore, it is important that the principle of balance is applied’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/maximising-access-to-drug-treatment-while-minimising-diversion-of-medications_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0038	2021-01-29	UNK	EMCDDA enters new phase as it embarks on 2021 activities 	 This year, the EMCDDA will embark on a new five-year Roadmap under its Strategy 2025, kicking off with an ambitious range of activities for the period 2021–23. We enter this new phase amid major uncertainty, when the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains largely unknown. In such times, as seen in 2020, the strength of the agency lies, not only in its planning capability, but also in its agility and capacity to adapt rapidly to new realities. I am pleased to announce that, at the heart of our work in 2021 will be the development of a new business model, which places customers and digital transformation at its core. This new model is designed to ensure that the EMCDDA will be fit to perform in an increasingly dynamic external environment and prepared to embrace new opportunities that may arise. Among the developments shaping our work is the new EU Drugs Strategy 2021–25, which sets the political framework, priorities and actions for implementing EU drugs policy over the next five years. Our strategic developments are also informed by a range of initiatives, including our ongoing ‘Futures’ exercise, as well as the outcome of the fourth external evaluation of the agency in 2018. While innovating our business model, we will continue to invest in our flagship publications, including: the second Health and social responses to drug problems: a European guide; the fourth EMCDDA–Europol EU Drug Markets Report and the annual European Drug Report. These products will be complemented by smaller, focused and timely analyses on emerging topics, as well as a range of knowledge-exchange activities, including the dissemination of best practice and capacity-building and training initiatives. Developing and implementing the new business model will require further innovation of our information-collection methods, for more sensitive and timely reporting in the areas of health and security, in close collaboration with the Reitox national focal points and other networks. It will also require enriching our collaboration with external partners, such as through our Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance project (IPA 7), the EU4Monitoring Drugs project (EU4MD) and our first bilateral project with Georgia (EMCDDA4GE). At the centre of our work is our vision to contribute to a healthier and more secure Europe, through efforts to improve the health and security of people living in the EU. This overarching commitment will drive the agency in the years to come and guide it in delivering added value. It was an honour and a privilege last year to be reappointed as EMCDDA Director to take the agency forward on this exciting course of travel to 2025. I am thrilled to lead the agency through one of the most challenging, yet most promising, times since its creation. Together with an ever-committed staff and partners, I look forward to a new period in the life of the EMCDDA, which will build on innovation to bring sustainable growth for EU drug monitoring. The EMCDDA Programming Document 2021–23 will be published in February: www.emcdda.europa.eu 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/1/emcdda-enters-new-phase-it-embarks-2021-activities_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0039	2021-01-28	UNK	EU presidency: Portugal focuses on Europe’s recovery and chairs activities in the field of drugs 	 This month, Portugal took over the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU with the motto ‘Time to deliver: a fair, green and digital recovery’. Over the next six months, Portugal will lead work at all levels of the Council, building co-operation, agreement and solidarity between EU Member States. The presidency will focus on three key priorities: promoting a European recovery, boosted by the green and digital transitions; implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights; strengthening the strategic autonomy of a Europe open to the world. A central theme of the presidency will be strengthening the European social model. The aim will be to ensure that the climate and digital transitions are achieved in an inclusive way, whilst addressing the social dimension of the COVID-19 pandemic. In May, an EU Social Summit will be hosted in Porto focusing on employment, qualifications and social protection. The event will be divided into: a High-Level Conference (7 May) — involving EU institutions, Member States, social partners and civil society — and an Informal Meeting of European Leaders (8 May). The presidency will also support the creation of a European Health Union, which strengthens the capacity to respond to public health crises and to produce and distribute safe vaccines, in Europe and beyond. It will also help ensure that the process of vaccination against COVID-19 takes place simultaneously in all Member States. In the area of external action, attention will be paid to relations with EU neighbouring countries, to EU relations with Africa and Latin America and to transatlantic relations, including a revised agenda with the new US administration. An Informal Meeting of European Leaders with the Prime Minister of India will also take place to give momentum to stronger political and economic dialogue. Portuguese presidency and drugs In the field of drugs, Portugal now chairs the Council’s Horizontal Working Party on Drugs (HDG), with six meetings scheduled with the EU Member States and additional dialogues on drugs with relevant international partners (including Brazil, China and the United States). The HDG will be presided over by Dr João Goulão, Portugal’s national drug coordinator and Director-General of the General-Directorate for Intervention on Addictive Behaviours and Dependencies (SICAD). The HDG is responsible for leading and managing the Council's work in the drugs domain and carries out legislative and general policy work in the areas of supply reduction and demand reduction. Its main goals are to: develop EU strategies, action plans and other relevant documents in the drugs field; exchange information between Member States and with third countries on national policies; and coordinate measures taken by EU Member States in Europe and beyond. Continuing the work of the outgoing German Presidency, and based on the new EU drugs strategy for 2021–25, Portugal will have as one of its main objectives the preparation of the next action plan on drugs, based on information that is scientific, evidence-based and measurable. Portugal will also lead the EU and its Member States at the 64th session of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (Vienna,12–16 April 2021). The current Portuguese presidency, running from 1 January to 30 June 2021, is the fourth held by Portugal, following those of 1992, 2000 and 2007. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/portuguese-presidency-eu-and-drugs_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0040	2021-01-27	UNK	EMCDDA kicks off new wave of webinars for 2021	 The EMCDDA will be kicking off its 2021 programme of webinars on 3 February starting with the topic ‘Responding to drugs and homelessness: innovative approaches in Europe’. The link between long-term homelessness, problem drug use and alcohol dependence is well documented. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there are concerns that the health and social wellbeing of the homeless population will worsen. Addressing the diverse and complex needs of this group requires targeted, sustained and joined-up interventions. A panel of frontline workers from Belgium, Portugal and Finland will share their experiences of implementing solutions to address issues linked to homelessness among vulnerable populations, including people who use drugs. Presenting key innovations in this field, they will explore some of the major facilitators and barriers to successful implementation and respond to queries in a Q&A session. Further details on panel members and how to register for the event are available here. The new programme of webinars follows a testing phase in 2020, which saw seven COVID-19-related webinars rolled out between May and December. The sessions aimed to help those working in the drugs field understand how drug users, and those supporting them, were coping with the pandemic and to exchange knowledge and experience. An additional webinar was dedicated to the launch of the 2019 ESPAD report and explored its use among key target audiences. EMCDDA webinars are designed to give a voice to professionals working in the drugs field and are conceived as conversations around key topics of interest and emerging challenges as well as a means to build relations with potential or future stakeholders. Chaired by EMCDDA staff members, the webinars are open to professionals working in the drugs field and other individuals with an interest in the topic. Subsequent webinars will be announced under EMCDDA Events. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/emcdda-kicks-new-wave-webinars-2021_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0043	2021-01-11	UNK	Euro-DEN Plus network prepares to expand beyond the EU 	 Data from hospital emergency departments show that every year in Europe thousands of individuals experience drug-related toxicity and other harms, resulting in emergency presentations to hospital (1). Supported by the EMCDDA, the European Drug Emergencies Network (Euro-DEN Plus) monitors drug-related emergency presentations across Europe to provide unique insight into acute health harms related to drug use (2). A Euro-DEN Plus technical kick-off meeting is taking place today to discuss the expansion of the network in 2021 to new hospital ‘sentinel’ centres in European cities outside the EU (see below). New centres will be located in countries participating in the EU-funded EU4Monitoring Drugs (EU4MD) project, developed and managed by the EMCDDA as part of its ongoing commitment to strengthening cooperation and sharing expertise with partners in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) area. The project supports national and regional readiness to identify and respond to drug-related security and health threats (see map of EU4MD countries). Also expected is the enrolment of new centres in candidate countries and potential candidates to the EU, in the framework of technical cooperation projects financed by the European Commission’s Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA). The ultimate goal of these projects is to familiarise the beneficiaries with EU policies and working methods and to support them for participating in the work of the EMCDDA (see IPA 7 project and map of IPA 7 beneficiaries). The Euro-DEN Plus network already includes a total of 28 sentinel centres in 18 EU Member States, Norway, the UK and Switzerland. New centres in candidate countries and potential candidates, and in neighbouring countries, will not only expand geographical coverage of data monitoring, but will also reinforce the network, and strengthen the policy-oriented monitoring of acute drug-related harms in new regions. Euro-DEN Plus technical kick-off meeting The EMCDDA and Euro-DEN Plus are holding the first network meeting today with selected experts from the EU4MD and the IPA7 partners. The meeting, involving 25 experts from 12 countries, aims to provide representatives of the forthcoming centres with an overview of the Euro-DEN Plus project and its data-collection model. During the meeting (conducted in English, French and Russian), the participants will take part in a roundtable on Euro-DEN Plus data collection and discuss the timeline and work plan for the contribution of the new centres. This first technical meeting with the interested centres and practitioners will support the deployment of the network and formalise the recruitment of the new centres into the project in 2021. The participants will include: members of the Euro-DEN Plus Steering Group; representatives of the EMCDDA; clinicians in hospital emergency rooms, poison centres and other emergency settings who receive patients presenting with acute drug-toxicity. This broad participation is designed to facilitate discussions on how the Euro-DEN Plus data collection can serve as a novel data source, feeding into more established monitoring of drug use and drug-related harms in the respective countries. The EMCDDA adopts a multi-indicator approach to drug monitoring on the principle that no single measure can provide a full picture of the drug situation and of the quickly changing drug-related health threats (3). This was discussed with experts from the EU4MD countries, in the margin of the last annual expert meeting on drug-related deaths (4), where the benefit and value of the Euro-DEN Plus projects were presented. The EMCDDA views hospital emergency data-collection as a useful addition to its monitoring toolkit. The agency is confident that enriched by six years of contributing to drug monitoring and responses in Europe (5), the Euro-DEN Plus project can support local experts in developing the network in their respective cities. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2021/euro-den-plus-network-prepares-expand-beyond-eu_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0044	2021-01-08	UNK	Message from EMCDDA Director, Alexis Goosdeel	 In this first week of the new year, I would like to thank you for your continued support and wish you a very happy 2021. Ringing in the new year may have felt a little different this time as we reflected on the trials of the past 12 months. Yet in many ways, we have emerged strengthened and enriched and can look ahead with optimism. The past year saw astounding triumphs of human and scientific achievement, with vaccines rolled out with record speed, our preparedness for future crises strengthened and our ability to adapt to digital working and learning tested and confirmed. Of course, 2021 will not be without its challenges. We are all still learning from this pandemic, which continues to evolve. But we embark on the year with more wisdom, fresh hope and a new openness to innovate and evolve. On behalf of the EMCDDA, I would like to wish you health and happiness and a fruitful and positive year ahead.

EMCDDA_UNK_0045	2020-12-22	UNK	EMCDDA releases study findings on the impact of COVID-19 on drug markets, use and services in the southern ENP region	 The emergence of new drug trafficking routes, the reduced availability of drug-related health services and the adaptation of drug treatment protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic are among the findings highlighted today in a new EMCDDA report: Impact of COVID-19 on drug markets, drug use, drug-related harms and responses in south European Neighbourhood Policy countries. The publication is released in the framework of the EMCDDA EU4Monitoring Drugs project, funded by the EU and launched in 2019. The project paves the way for the agency to cooperate and exchange data more readily with the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) partner countries. A similar report relating to the eastern ENP region was released in September. Today’s report presents the key results of an EMCDDA trendspotter study, prepared in consultation with some 20 experts from seven southern ENP countries (1). A summary of the report in English is available in Arabic, Hebrew and French. The south ENP region, which comprises diverse countries in North Africa and the Middle East, is an important nexus for drug smuggling to, and from, the EU, as well as a well-known hub for the production of cannabis and amphetamine-containing substances. The report highlights the following changes in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic across the southern ENP region: Drug markets — Signs of supply chain disruption were seen in a reduction in the volume and number of seizures at borders and in increases in retail and wholesale level prices for certain types of drugs in some countries. In terms of drug trafficking across North Africa and the Middle East, the most noticeable developments were linked to the emergence of new trafficking routes. Distribution appeared mostly unaffected, with continued street-level drug dealing. But there were signs of an increase in the use of mobile applications for ordering drugs, in some countries, and also in darknet activity in Israel, Jordan and Palestine. Drug use and drug-related harms — Data on drug use remain scarce in the region but available information suggest that the availability of some well-established illicit drugs decreased, which is thought to have led to a reduction in their use. In some contexts, this appears to have resulted in a greater use of substitutes (e.g. home-made substances, adulterated alcohol, new psychoactive substances, etc.), sometimes leading to harmful patterns of use (e.g. injecting). More generally, experts felt that the COVID-19 pandemic had further exacerbated long-standing economic and political challenges, which had the potential to lead to increased use of psychoactive substances and to higher levels of mental health morbidity. Drug services — Drug-related services, in some countries, reduced their offer in the early lockdown period by temporarily closing treatment facilities or restricting access for new clients. At the same time, where possible, drug treatment and outreach services adapted their policies and protocols to ensure the uninterrupted provision of services (e.g. take-home medicines and online or telephone consultations). The report concludes that the experience gained during the pandemic confirmed that national authorities may need to further ensure that practitioners and law-enforcement officers remain adequately equipped and skilled to work both in a situation of health emergencies and in an environment where online communication and digital tools may start to dominate. Continued cooperation, and investment in drug monitoring systems, will help the EU and partner countries identify important new developments and design appropriate strategies to address new challenges. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/emcdda-releases-study-findings-on-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-drug-markets-use-and-services-in-the-southern-enp-region_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0046	2020-12-21	UNK	New report explores open sale of low-THC cannabis products and regulatory responses in Europe	 An increase in the open sale of cannabis products in Europe has raised questions around the possible legal and commercial status of these products. In a new report released today, Low-THC cannabis products in Europe, the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) presents an initial overview of the current situation in this increasingly dynamic area. Cannabis contains many different chemicals, the best-known being Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) — largely responsible for the intoxicating effects of the plant when it is ingested. But it also includes many other cannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD). There is now a growing commercial interest in developing products that contain cannabidiol or other extracts of the cannabis plant, but without THC, or with only very low levels of THC present. For the purposes of this report, these are referred to as low-THC products. The study found that low-THC cannabis products are being offered for sale in the majority of EU countries. A wide variety of retailers are active in the low-THC market in Europe. While cannabis-themed products can now be found in everyday retail outlets (e.g. health food chain stores, chemists and cafes), there are also dedicated shops selling low-THC cannabis products. Some of these focus on health and well-being, while others appear to be focusing more closely on products that look more similar to those that exist on the illicit recreational cannabis market, but with only low levels of THC present. This means that products containing extracts of the cannabis plant are appearing in a number of different commercial areas where differing regulatory frameworks exist. In some cases, this is also creating tension with drug control regulations. In addition to products, such as balms, creams and pastes, the wide variety of products available include cannabis-infused edible products (e.g. ready-to-eat products, beverages), and some that mirror established illicit cannabis products (e.g. herb, resin, oil, e-liquids, crystals). As the sale of low-THC products gains visibility, so the regulatory environment has started to change to both acknowledge and, in some cases, restrict their availability. At EU level, there have been some recent important developments in this area. As well as describing the current situation, the report highlights the need for ongoing monitoring of this diverse and dynamic phenomenon in order to ensure that the most appropriate consumer safety, health protection and drug control frameworks are applied. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/new-report-explores-open-sale-of-low-thc-cannabis-products-and-regulatory-responses-in-europe_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0047	2020-12-18	UNK	Season’s greetings and warm wishes  for a safe and healthy 2021	 Dear colleagues, At the start of this year, when we embarked on our 25 years of monitoring celebrations, we knew it was going to be a special 12 months. Little did we know then just how unusual and challenging the year would turn out to be… 2020 has been a tough year. COVID-19 has had a disruptive impact on all of our lives, and on the drug phenomenon in Europe, and some of the repercussions may be long-lasting. When I reflect on these months, I feel proud of the way in which the EMCDDA team swiftly adapted to new, digital ways of working and embraced the procedures of our business continuity plan, ensuring a smooth transition to a new routine. As EMCDDA Director, I am also proud of how we were able to take the pulse of the impact of the pandemic on drug use, services and markets. This underlined, more than ever, how timely and good quality data are critical for keeping pace with new threats and developments and for identifying areas requiring a rapid response. The COVID-19 crisis has shown us the true value of information that is scientific, evidence-based and comparable across countries. I would like to thank the EMCDDA staff, the Reitox national focal points, our statutory bodies, EU institutions and other partners for their support and dedication in these challenging times. We have produced an impressive set of results. Our special taskforce on COVID-19 coordinated scientific and communication activities on the pandemic, which led to rapid surveys and reports as well as a new series of webinars for professionals working in the drugs field. We were also delighted to launch a special anniversary edition of our European Drug Report in a digital event with European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson. It was an honour and a privilege this year to be reappointed as EMCDDA Director to take the agency forward on an ambitious course of travel to 2025. The agency has an exciting future ahead of it and is ready to innovate within the boundaries of its remit. In an era when digital transformation becomes vital for organisations to deliver value to stakeholders, we will continue pursuing the use of new technologies for business optimisation and communication. Our planned new business model will help us to contribute more efficiently to a healthier and more secure Europe. The year 2020 has taught us many lessons and I feel we will emerge from it strengthened and enriched. The pandemic has shown us the value of partnerships and communities and how, together, we can make a difference to people’s lives. I would like to send all of the EMCDDA staff and partners Season’s greetings and warm wishes for a safe and healthy 2021! Alexis Goosdeel, EMCDDA Director 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/seasons-greetings-and-warm-wishes-safe-and-healthy-2021_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0048	2020-12-16	UNK	Cannabidiol (CBD) is not considered a ‘narcotic drug’ under European law	 In November 2020, the European Court of Justice published a judgement stating that cannabidiol extracted from the cannabis plant should not be considered a drug under the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. The 1961 UN Convention is the basis for national drug control laws controlling cannabis. It states that unauthorised sale of ‘cannabis flowers’ and ‘extracts and tinctures of cannabis’ should be subject to criminal penalties, and this was subsequently reflected in the EU Council Framework Decision 2004/757 on drug trafficking penalties. These flowers and extracts contain several different cannabinoids, whose concentrations can vary greatly by plant variety and by growing technique. The two most extensively studied cannabinoids are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). While THC is known to be the main psychoactive component of cannabis, the recent review by the World Health Organization's Expert Committee on Drug Dependence found that CBD ‘has no potential for abuse and no potential to produce dependence’ (1). The European Court ruling resulted from a case referred from the French courts. In 2017, a French court convicted the seller of e-cigarette cartridges containing CBD that had been legally extracted from the whole hemp plant in Czechia, because in France only fibre and seeds are legal hemp. This case was referred to the European Court of Justice (case C-663/18), and on 19 November 2020 the court published its judgement). The court stated that, while evidence of the risk to health from CBD was still limited but may justify precautionary restrictive measures, it was inconsistent to apply the marketing ban only to organic, and not synthetic, CBD. Examining the legality of these measures that restricted the free movement of goods within the EU, the court also stated that CBD extracted from cannabis was not a drug within the meaning of the 1961 Convention; and that the EU industrial hemp regulations were not applicable to the CBD extract, as it is not an agricultural product within those regulations’ definitions. Following this decision, the European Commission has noted in a recent press briefing that cannabidiol should not be considered as a drug within the meaning of the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and cannabidiol can be qualified as food, provided that the other conditions of the EU Food Safety Regulation are also met. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/cannabidiol-cbd-is-not-considered-a-narcotic-drug-under-european-law_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0049	2020-12-15	UNK	EMCDDA signs new agreement with Serbia	 The EMCDDA and Serbia signed a new Working Arrangement this month, which will pave the way for greater cooperation on monitoring the drug phenomenon in Europe and beyond its borders. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the agreement was formalised through an exchange of letters between: Milan Pekić, Acting Director of the Office for Combating Drugs of the Government of Serbia; Prof. Dr Berislav Vekić, Secretary of State, Ministry of Health; Vladimir Rebić, General Police Director, Ministry of the Interior and Alexis Goosdeel, EMCDDA Director. The Working Arrangement originates in a request, in April 2019, from the Serbian Office for Combating Drugs (OCD), the body in charge of coordinating drug policy in the Republic of Serbia. After receiving the favourable opinion of the European Commission on the draft text in December 2019, the EMCDDA Management Board mandated the Director to sign the agreement. This Working Arrangement is the third to be signed between the EMCDDA and a partner from South-eastern Europe (the first being Albania in 2019 and the second being Kosovo* in September 2020). The new agreement provides for the exchange of expertise between the entities concerned, thus contributing to developing drug data-collection and reporting capacity in the region. The EMCDDA began its cooperation with Serbia in 2007 in the framework of EU-funded technical assistance projects designed to prepare Western Balkan partners for accession to the EU (and for participation in the work of the EMCDDA and its Reitox network). Serbia is one of the six partners currently receiving assistance under the EMCDDA IPA7 project, running from July 2019 to June 2022. Serbia's cooperation with the EMCDDA operates through its National Drug Observatory (NDO), the National Monitoring Centre for Drugs, located within the Ministry of Health. Following an assessment by EMCDDA experts in June 2018, it was revealed that, in the past few years, progress has been made on the three core functions carried out by an NDO: data collection; monitoring, analysis and interpretation of the data collected; and reporting and dissemination. The EMCDDA and Serbia are currently working together to consolidate Serbia’s capacity to monitor the drug phenomenon through the use of evidence-based tools and knowledge built and promoted within the EU. This cooperation led to the production of a national drug report published in July 2017 on the EMCDDA website. This new Working Arrangement, as well as the current EMCDDA–IPA 7 project, will also allow for the exchange of expertise and data on new psychoactive substances between the EMCDDA and Serbia, thanks to the Serbian national early-warning system. * This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/emcdda-signs-new-agreement-serbia_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0050	2020-12-14	UNK	EMCDDA Best practice portal update (4/2020)	 Evidence updates on social reintegration and employment-focused interventions Employment is one of the strongest predictors of positive outcomes for persons with substance use disorder. Unemployed clients in treatment often report that their current unemployment is due to substance use. They also refer to a variety of obstacles to employment. These obstacles include: lack of transport, poor work history, lack of education/skills, low job availability, stigma/lack of employer understanding, probation/treatment programme requirements, and criminal record. In our latest Best Practice Portal update, we highlight a recent and comprehensive systematic review of interventions intended to improve employment outcomes for persons with substance use disorder at any stage of recovery. Nine programmes or models were identified, with Individual Placement and Support (IPS) and its variant Customised Employment Supports (CES) having the most studies with positive results. Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is based on eight principles aimed at helping individuals to find and work in competitive jobs of their choosing. These principles are competitive employment, systematic job development, rapid job search, integrated services, benefits planning, no client exclusion, worker preferences, and time-unlimited support. IPS was originally developed, and is an evidence-based intervention, for individuals with serious mental illness. Customised Employment Supports (CES) is an employment counselling intervention adapted from the IPS model. The main difference is that CES does not incorporate job development, but rather relies on available jobs in the community, and includes an emphasis on fieldwork— accompanying clients into the community for such things as looking for local job postings and making employer contacts. The review suggests that three elements, common across most of those interventions, show significant effects: the provision of individual services, service integration among multiple providers and long-term support. Evidence summaries are available at the Best practice portal (BPP). Permanent housing for the homeless population A new BPP update highlights the positive effects of permanent supportive housing in increasing long-term (6 years) housing stability in the homeless population. Permanent supportive housing has changed the sequence of treatment and housing, as access to the accommodation is no longer subject to adherence to treatment or abstinence. Permanent housing has become a strategy that is often combined with coordinated case management, resulting in small but promising evidence of recipients showing greater improvements in their subjective quality of life than those receiving standard care. Future research should focus on the long-term effects of housing interventions on physical, mental health and substance use. Opioid Substitution Treatment (OST) initiation in Emergency Departments Positive short-term effects on treatment outcomes have been found for Buprenorphine initiation in Emergency Departments (ED). A new entry in the BPP assessed the evidence of OST initiation in hospital emergencies and preliminary results seem to show that EDs can be an appropriate setting for initiating treatment and a key entry point for people with substance use disorders. The review highlights that in order for ED OST interventions to be scaled up and sustained, many barriers ranging from physician readiness, lack of formal training, time constraints, and absence of community-based referral networks to ensure longer-term retention need to be successfully addressed. Webinar series: The EMCDDA will host the last webinar of 2020 on the 16th of December, and it will address the COVID-19 induced economic recession and drug-related problems. The purpose of the webinars is to help those working in the drugs field understand how drug users, and those supporting them, are coping with the pandemic and to share knowledge and experience. The webinars give a voice to key professionals working in the drugs field and allow for a panel discussion on emerging challenges.

EMCDDA_UNK_0051	2020-12-10	UNK	In memoriam — Richard Hartnoll	 It was with great sadness that the EMCDDA learned of the passing of Richard Hartnoll on 8 December, following a long illness. Richard made a major contribution to the development of the European drug information system, first through his work with the Council of Europe’s Pompidou Group and, subsequently, through his pioneering work at the EMCDDA. Richard was involved in the activities of the EMCDDA from its very outset, joining the agency as Head of the Epidemiology Department in 1995. He worked at the agency until mid-2002, and in these years, made a substantial contribution to the development of the current EU drug monitoring system. In many ways, he can be regarded as the father figure of the EMCDDA’s core epidemiological indicators. Before joining the agency, Richard worked at the influential Drug Indicators Project in London, and at the Institut Municipal d'Investigació Mèdica (IMIM) in Barcelona. His work spanned all of the critical drug monitoring questions of the day — and included the development work that resulted in Europe’s current approach to monitoring drug treatment. In his retirement, Richard found a new love, photography, and would enjoy strolling through Lisbon with a camera in his hand, often inviting his former colleagues to his exhibitions. He will be greatly missed by all his colleagues at the EMCDDA and we send our condolences to his loving family. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/memoriam-%E2%80%94-richard-hartnoll_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0052	2020-12-07	UNK	Recreational cannabis supply approved by voters in four US states but rejected in New Zealand	 United States On 3 November 2020, in tandem with the US presidential election, the four states of Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota voted on and approved proposals to introduce systems of home and retail supply of cannabis for recreational use for over-21s. In New Jersey, the proposal was placed on the ballot by the State Legislature, as the state has no possibility for public ballot initiatives. In the other three states, the proposals were public initiatives. Of these, South Dakota is notable as two separate ballot measures legalised cannabis for medical and recreational purposes on the same day; the other states had already approved medical use some years earlier. Legal sales for recreational use are unlikely to start for at least one year as the states have yet to design their cannabis retail systems. Local and municipal authorities may still introduce zoning restrictions. The number of states where cultivation and use of cannabis by adults is legal for recreational purposes will now rise to 15 (not counting Washington DC); of these, only DC does not also allow commercial sales. These jurisdictions have a combined population of approximately 112 million people (33 % of the US population). At the same time, the state of Mississippi voted to approve a system for medical use of cannabis, with 68 % in favour. Voters were given a choice of two options, and chose the more expansive Ballot Measure 65 (for those with qualifying conditions; 22 were listed), with 74 % of the vote, rather than the more restrictive Ballot Measure 65A (for those with terminal medical conditions). See table below for details.

A draft law on this was already published in May to enable voters to understand the details, allowing for the fact that modifications could take place after approval (see earlier news). The proposal was rejected by 50.7 % to 48.4 %. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who voted in favour of the proposal, has stated that her incoming government will not legalise recreational cannabis, but will strengthen the application of sections of the Misuse of Drugs Act that refer drug users to health-oriented services rather than punishment. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/recreational-cannabis-supply-approved-voters-four-us-states-rejected-new-zealand_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0053	2020-11-24	UNK	Emerging methamphetamine industry in Afghanistan ‘worrying’, says new EMCDDA study 	 There are signs that a methamphetamine industry is taking hold in Afghanistan, according to a new report published today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). The paper — Emerging evidence of Afghanistan’s role as a producer and supplier of ephedrine and methamphetamine — explores whether the country, renowned for being the world's leading opium producer, has the potential to become a significant producer of methamphetamine. The report is the result of research conducted under the EU4Monitoring Drugs (EU4MD) project, funded by the European Commission. Today’s findings, although preliminary, are ‘worrying’, states the report. New data suggest that relatively large quantities of low-cost ephedrine (1) and methamphetamine are now produced in Afghanistan, and outputs may have the potential, in the long term, to rival the country’s production of opiates (opium, morphine, heroin). The study is based on interviews with ephedrine and methamphetamine ‘cooks’, and other key informants, in the district of Bakwa (Farah province, south-west Afghanistan) in August 2020, as well as on documentary sources and the analysis of high-resolution satellite images. Innovation, diversification and a move to plant-based production The report describes how Afghan farmers have adapted to survive in the face of environmental and other challenges. It notes the important innovation, in the last three years, by some rural households in the south-west, to diversify into the production and processing of ‘significant quantities of ephedrine and methamphetamine’. The emergence of this ‘new, and rapidly expanding, industry’ follows the realisation by Afghan drug traders that the oman (ephedra) plants — which have grown wild in the country’s central highlands for centuries — are a source of ephedrine, a precursor chemical used to make methamphetamine. Although methamphetamine production was occurring in the country between 2013 and 2017, it was relatively uncommon, low-scale and based on ephedrine extracted from medicines (e.g. cough syrups), in a costly process requiring specialised chemists. ‘The move to plant-based production in Bakwa appears to have changed this,’ says the report. It describes a two-tier system involving two types of laboratory: the first where ephedrine is extracted from ephedra plants by semi-skilled workers, and the second where methamphetamine is made from ephedrine by specialist ‘cooks’. Many in Bakwa have now become involved in the new ‘cottage industry’ of extracting ephedrine from ephedra plants to supplement their income. As one ‘ephedrine cook’ put it: ‘This is easy, everyone can learn it’. It is estimated that, at the time of the research, there were around 330 suspected ephedrine extraction sites, ranging from small household operations to larger factories, often run by local ephedrine traders (some of whom may also be involved in the opium trade). Once produced, the ephedrine is sold to traders from other provinces or directly to local methamphetamine production facilities, where skilled ‘methamphetamine cooks’ take over. Potential scale of production ‘considerable’ Although the total amount of methamphetamine produced in Afghanistan is difficult to estimate, and the scope of this research is limited to Bakwa, this analysis suggests that the potential scale of methamphetamine production is ‘considerable’. It is estimated that the existing ephedrine extraction sites in Bakwa would have the capacity to produce around 98 tonnes of ephedrine per month (from 3 000 tonnes of dried ephedra), which could generate around 65 tonnes of crystal methamphetamine a month. Around 500 methamphetamine laboratories would be needed to process this amount of the drug. It is unlikely that there are this many methamphetamine laboratories in Bakwa itself, and reports of ephedrine being shipped to other provinces, or being seized on the Afghan-Iranian border, suggest that production may be taking place in other parts of Afghanistan or in neighbouring countries. Among the destinations of Afghan methamphetamine cited in the report are neighbouring Iran and Pakistan. There are also increasing reports of methamphetamine connected with Afghanistan being seized further afield (e.g. Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Australia and countries in Africa). A burgeoning Afghan synthetic drug economy The growing synthetic (2) drug industry in Bakwa appears to be making a significant economic impact in the area, potentially providing up to EUR 46.8 million to the local economy in wages. If the potential amount of ephedrine produced in Bakwa were converted into methamphetamine locally, the industry could be worth an estimated EUR 203 million in Bakwa alone. Increasing reports of further ephedrine and methamphetamine processing in other Afghan provinces (Nimroz, Herat, Nangarhar), raises concern that the output of the country’s methamphetamine industry could one day potentially rival its sizeable opiate economy. The report notes that there is considerable scope for ephedra crop cultivation in Afghanistan. With 192 000 km2 of land higher than 2 500 metres — the altitude where ephedra reportedly grows best — the potential exists for increasing production of this crop. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘This new analysis of the scale of Afghan ephedrine and methamphetamine production, the income it generates and the speed at which it has emerged, are both surprising and worrying. The degree to which producers in a small corner of the country have adopted new technologies, and established methamphetamine production with a potential global impact, serves as a reminder of how dramatically drug markets can change over short periods of time. We are now starting to see signs that methamphetamine produced in Afghanistan is beginning to appear on the international market. Given the regular heroin traffic and well-established trafficking routes between south-west Asia and Europe, there is an urgent need to learn more about this phenomenon. I think a clear need exists now to consider how we respond to the threat posed by increasing methamphetamine production in Afghanistan, both to the country itself and to the international community’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/11/emerging-methamphetamine-industry-in-afghanistan-worrying-says-new-emcdda-study_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0054	2020-11-23	UNK	Fifty countries gather for 2020 virtual Reitox week 	 Representatives of candidate, potential candidate and neighbouring countries of the EU are joining members of the EMCDDA’s Reitox network this week (23–27 November) for the agency’s ninth Reitox week. The purpose of this annual event is to broaden the scope of the regular Heads of national focal point (NFP) meetings, underline the usefulness of the EU drug monitoring model; add impetus to the agency’s technical cooperation with partners outside the EU and learn from each other’s experience. The 2020 Reitox week, taking place for the first time virtually, unites some 50 countries, including: 29 NFPs (EU 27, Turkey and Norway); six partners of the Western Balkans (beneficiaries of the European Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance/IPA7); 14 European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) countries participating under the EU4Monitoring Drugs project (EU4MD); Switzerland and Russia. The week encompasses four events: 23 November: Second meeting of the EU4MD advisory committee — The week kicks off with a meeting of the EU4MD advisory committee. This session will include project progress reports as well as updates from the partner countries, institutions and organisations. The three-year EU4MD project, funded by the European Union, involves countries in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) area, and supports national and regional readiness to identify and respond to drug-related security and health threats. 24 November: 9th Extended Reitox network meeting — This meeting, involving the 29 Reitox national focal points and representatives of the agency’s key partner countries, aims to foster the exchange of ‘know-how’ and experience on practical and thematic issues. The theme of this year’s meeting is ‘The impact of COVID-19 on drug-related issues’ and will showcase the activities carried out by the national focal points during the pandemic. This included launching new COVID-19-related surveys, creating and providing national guidelines, disseminating information to drug users and staff of drug services, and providing new services. The NFPs demonstrated their strong ability to adapt and, despite the challenges, were able to continue their work with no major disruption. 25 November: IPA7 project coordination meeting — The state of play of the IPA7 technical cooperation project will be the subject of the third meeting of the week. This will offer updates on the EMCDDA’s work on the impact of COVID-19 on drug use, markets and services, as well as specific activities in the areas of health and security. The Western Balkan partners will give briefings on drug-related activities at national level, including challenges posed by COVID-19. The IPA7 project was launched in July 2019 and aims to integrate the six IPA beneficiaries in the activities of the EMCDDA and its Reitox network. 25–27 November: 63rd Heads of Reitox national focal point meeting — The week will end with the regular Heads of focal point meeting (27 countries) and will focus on the joint EMCDDA–NFP routine network business. Topics featured on the agenda are: recent and future policy and institutional developments; the state of play of the Reitox development framework (including a new certification process for the NFPs); national reporting and EMCDDA activities in the areas of health and security. The Reitox network is composed of 29 NFPs in the 27 EU Member States, Turkey and Norway, as well as a focal point at the European Commission. The NFPs — from which the agency draws the bulk of its data — collect and analyse national information on drugs, drawing on various sectors including health, justice and law enforcement. Reitox weeks have been held annually since 2012. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/fifty-countries-gather-for-2020-virtual-reitox-week_en

The Committee also plays a pivotal role in the agency’s risk assessment of new psychoactive substances. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/10/emcdda-scientific-committee-appoints-new-chair-and-vice-chair_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0056	2020-11-12	UNK	New ESPAD results: teenage drinking and smoking down, but concerns over risky cannabis use and new addictive behaviours 	 Smoking and drinking among 15–16-year-old school students are showing signs of decline, but there are concerns over potentially risky cannabis use and the challenges posed by new addictive behaviours. These are among the findings released today in a new report from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD). The study, published in collaboration with the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), is based on a 2019 survey in 35 European countries, including 25 EU Member States (1). This is the seventh data-collection wave conducted by the ESPAD project since 1995. A total of 99 647 students participated in the latest survey round, responding to an anonymous questionnaire. The ESPAD Report 2019 features information on students’ experience of, and perceptions about, a variety of substances, including: tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs, inhalants, pharmaceuticals and new psychoactive substances (NPS). Social media use, gaming and gambling are also covered. To keep up with emerging risk behaviours among young people in Europe, the ESPAD questionnaire is constantly adapted to include new topics, while maintaining a set of core questions to track long-term trends. To better describe contemporary patterns of nicotine consumption, the scope of the 2019 survey was extended to include e-cigarette smoking for the first time in all participating countries. Screening instruments were also employed to assess risk behaviours, including problem gambling, high-risk cannabis use and self-perceived problems with social media use and gaming (2). Decline in teenage drinking and cigarette smoking and new insights into e-cigarette use Alcohol use remains high among adolescents in Europe, with an average of over three-quarters (79%) of school students having used alcohol in their lifetime and almost half (47%) having used it in the last month (‘current use’)(3). But trend data (4) show some steady decreases, with levels now lower than in 2003 when both peaked at 91% and 63% respectively. The prevalence of ‘heavy episodic drinking’ (5) reached its lowest level in the 2019 survey (35%), following a peak in 2007 (43%) (Table 14). Data show that the gender gap in the prevalence of this pattern of alcohol use has narrowed over time (boys 36%; girls 34%) (Figure 20). Changes in drinking regulations at national level may have contributed to the decline in alcohol use among young people. Positive developments are also seen with regard to teenage smoking, against a backdrop of tobacco policy measures introduced over the last two decades. Between 1995 and 2019, ESPAD averages for cigarette use declined for lifetime use (68% to 42%); current use (33% to 20%) and daily use (20% to 10%). New data reveal high prevalence of e-cigarette smoking — 40% for lifetime use and 14% for last-month use — with those who have never smoked cigarettes (‘never smokers’) reporting higher rates of this behaviour than ‘occasional smokers’ and ‘regular smokers’. Although the study did not investigate the contents of e-cigarettes, it is likely that a high proportion of these devices include nicotine and that overall adolescent nicotine use could be rising again. This issue calls for further investigation given the potential for public health consequences. Illicit drug use declining, but concerns over high-risk cannabis use, prescription drugs and NPS The latest survey shows that, on average, 1 in 6 school students (17%) reported having used an illicit drug at least once in their life, with levels varying considerably across the ESPAD countries (range: 4.2%–29%). Lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use in this group has been declining slightly since 2011 (Table 14), although has been generally stable over the past two decades. Cannabis is still the illicit drug most used by school students in ESPAD countries. On average, 16% of respondents reported using cannabis at least once in their lifetime (11% in 1995), while 7.1% reported last-month use (4.1% in 1995). Lifetime use has slowly declined since 2011, while last-month use has stabilised since 2007. High-risk cannabis use, explored for the first time in all participating countries in the 2019 survey, revealed that, on average, 4% of respondents fell into this category and are potentially at risk of developing cannabis-related problems. Understanding and monitoring this phenomenon is important for formulating prevention policies. The non-medical use of prescription drugs among adolescents remains a concern. For example, 6.6% of those surveyed reported having used tranquilisers or sedatives and 4% painkillers ‘to get high’ in their lifetime. On average, 3.4% of students reported having used new psychoactive substances (NPS) in their lifetime — a small decrease from 4% in 2015 — but still representing higher levels of use than for amphetamine, ecstasy, cocaine or LSD taken individually. Almost all NPS users are polysubstance users (also consuming alcohol, cannabis and stimulants). The continued emergence of NPS and polysubstance use among NPS users underlines the need for close monitoring. Gambling, gaming and social media — vigilance needed According to the report: ‘The high degree of normalisation of gambling in societies and the culture of gambling within the family environment have been recognised as important drivers of gambling onset and youth progression into problem gambling’. The 2019 ESPAD results show that gambling for money has become a popular activity among school students in Europe, with 22% of respondents reporting gambling on at least one game in the past 12 months (predominantly lotteries). An estimated 7.9% of students had gambled for money online in that period. The screening tool used in the latest survey to estimate problem gambling revealed that, on average, 5% of students who had gambled in the last 12 months fell into this category. Over the last two decades, driven mainly by the increasing popularity of smartphones and tablets, gaming has become more popular and is increasingly played on these devices. Around 60% of respondents reported having played digital games on a typical school day within the last month (69% on a non-school day). In most countries, boys spend twice as much time gaming as girls. Around 94% of respondents reported use of social media in the past week. On average, users spent 2–3 hours on social media on a typical school day, rising to 6 or more hours on non-school days. In most countries, girls reported using social media on non-school days more frequently than boys. The report concludes: ‘With the 2019 data collection, ESPAD brings together comparable information from over 30 European countries over a period of 24 years. This places the project in a unique position to continue to make a valuable contribution to the development of credible and effective policies and interventions to protect youth health and social wellbeing in general’. ESPAD is  a collaborative network of independent research teams in over 40 European countries and the largest cross-national research project on adolescent substance use in the world. It is coordinated by the ESPAD Italian team at the National Research Council of Italy (CNR-IFC). The EMCDDA is a decentralised EU agency based in Lisbon which provides the EU and its Member States with factual, objective, reliable and comparable information on drugs and drug addiction and their consequences to inform policymaking and practice. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/9/highlights-espad-2019_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0057	2020-10-30	UNK	Looking back on 25 years of monitoring prevention in Europe	 By Gregor Burkhart, Principal scientific analyst — prevention, EMCDDA When the EMCDDA began its operations in 1995, it was clear that the understanding and narrative on prevention had to change. What was needed was a cultural shift from a rather amorphous concept — often based on good intentions — to a prevention that was more scientifically sound, rooted in clear concepts and evidence of effectiveness, and that could improve real-life practice and decision making. This month, Gregor Burkhart, Principal scientific analyst for prevention at the EMCDDA looks back on key milestones of the past 25 years of monitoring in this field. 1995–2000: Promoting basic evaluation When the EMCDDA started monitoring drug prevention in 1995, the level of evaluation of prevention interventions in Europe was low. This prompted us to focus first on promoting evaluation skills and tools in the prevention workforce and on awareness-raising on the importance of drug prevention among policymakers. One of our first steps was to develop the Exchange on Drug Demand Reduction Action (EDDRA)(1997) — a database of demand reduction interventions with minimum levels of evaluation — and to launch EMCDDA guidelines for the evaluation of drug prevention (1998). These early days also saw the organisation of the ‘First European Conference on the Evaluation of Drug Prevention’ (Lisbon, 1997) — the findings of which were published in the monograph Evaluating drug prevention in the European Union (1998) — and the ‘Second European Conference on the Evaluation of Drug Prevention’ (Strasbourg, 1999). 2001–2005: Better describing and classifying prevention interventions In order to facilitate evaluation, our next step was to launch the Evaluation Instruments Bank in 2001, offering easy-access tools for evaluating prevention and treatment. EDDRA was also growing at this time and was adopted by most EU Member States, including some of those entering the EU in 2004. In this period, we introduced the concepts of ‘universal’, ‘selective’ and ‘indicated’ prevention (in EMCDDA and EU official documents), began mapping manual-based prevention programmes and developed systematic prevention categories, allowing interventions to be rated and compared. At this point, we played an active role in establishing the first multi-country randomised prevention trial in Europe — the European Drug Addiction Prevention Trial (EU-DAP) — and its associated Unplugged programme, which is still used worldwide today. 2006–2010: Developing the evidence base for prevention In this next phase, we called for more responsibility and caution vis-à-vis the potential harms of mass media prevention campaigns. We also pioneered work explaining the potential of the little-known and under-used indicated prevention, dedicated to addressing personal neuro-behavioural vulnerabilities before problem substance use occurs. EDDRA expanded at this time as clearer categories of evaluation were introduced. Via an EU-funded project, the EMCDDA was instrumental in developing the European Drug Prevention Quality Standards (EDPQS), which set out criteria on how best to implement relevant and effective prevention. We also participated in the UNODC working group to establish International Standards on Substance Use Prevention and published the Prevention and Evaluation Resources Toolkit (PERK) to help professionals prepare their interventions for entering EDDRA. 2011–2015: Promoting the evidence base and prevention science As co-founder of the European Society for Prevention Research (EUSPR), the EMCDDA hosted the 2nd International Conference of the European Society for Prevention Research (EUSPR) in Lisbon in 2011. Here we presented a ‘how to’ guide on conducting high-quality drug prevention in the form of the European drug prevention quality standards: a manual for prevention professionals, which became a reference for the EU Minimal standards on Demand Reduction. During this period, we coined the concept of ‘environmental’ prevention, showcased evidence for prevention strategies in the Best Practice Portal and began publishing comparable data from all Member States in the EMCDDA prevention profiles, reaping the rewards of having harmonised and standardised rating criteria and prevention categories in previous years. 2016–2020: Taking evidence into the field of practice and decision-making In order to help decision-makers select effective programmes, the EMCDDA launched in 2017 its Xchange registry of interventions that have undergone rigorous scrutiny of their evidence for effectiveness, together with reports of their implementation. It also began hosting that year, an online Healthy Nightlife Toolbox (HNT), providing information on good-practice interventions targeting drug and alcohol use and related problems among young people in nightlife settings. Technical reports were also published in this period on ‘environmental’ prevention and its level of application in Europe (2018) and on exploring a systems perspective in the field (2019). Advancing the professionalism of the drug prevention workforce in Europe was the focus of a new European Prevention Curriculum (EUPC) handbook published by the EMCDDA in 2019, as part of the EU-funded UPC-Adapt project. This resource is now the basis for face-to-face, online and e-learning training courses and for EMCDDA-delivered cascaded training in European countries and beyond to help local decision-, opinion- and policy-makers improve their decision-making. The EUPC training was rolled out in 2019 and 2020 in a quarter of the EU Member States. Beyond 2020 Looking back at the past 25 years, much progress has been made in Europe in developing responsible and evidence-based interventions in substance use prevention. Yet, prevention practices for which there is little, or no, evidence of effectiveness are still being implemented in school and community settings today. This is why it is crucial to develop a professional prevention workforce that values prevention science and is trained in, and knowledgeable about, approaches that are empirically tested, safe and likely to yield results. In the coming years, the agency will expand its provision of EUPC training to frontline professionals, increase the use of online and digital approaches to reach and engage with the prevention workforce in European countries and continue to develop the knowledge base in the areas of effective environmental and crime-prevention interventions. The full range of EMCDDA resources is available on a prevention topics page. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/looking-back-on-25-years-of-monitoring-prevention-in-europe_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0058	2020-10-23	UNK	Upcoming data on substance use and risk behaviours among school students across Europe  	 The latest European data and analysis on substance use and risk behaviours among 15–16-year-old school students will be released in a new report on 12 November. The findings are based on a 2019 survey in 35 European countries conducted by the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD). A total of 99 647 students participated in the latest survey round. The ESPAD Report 2019 is published in collaboration with the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). The report will be presented virtually at an ESPAD–EMCDDA webinar entitled: ‘The European School Survey Project on Alcohol and other Drugs (ESPAD) — new results and stakeholder feedback’. Representatives from the two organisations will be joined in conversation by experts from the field of drug policy, research, prevention and parent associations. ESPAD has been running school surveys every four years since 1995. Seven data-collection waves have been conducted across 49 European countries. The new data cover the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, e-cigarettes and social media as well as gaming and gambling. The EMCDDA includes ESPAD data in its annual reporting on the drug situation and the two bodies cooperate closely to enhance understanding of long-term drug use trends in this population in Europe. Find out more Details on the upcoming report (in English) will be available on the EMCDDA website and a dedicated ESPAD landing page. The ESPAD site will also include additional results from the dataset underpinning the analysis. All tables will be downloadable in Excel format. Registration details for the webinar can be found here.

EMCDDA_UNK_0059	2020-10-20	UNK	EMCDDA Best practice portal update (3/2020)	 Substitution treatment for stimulants users? Finding a pharmacological treatment for stimulant users has been a research priority for the last decade. Many classes of drugs have been tested: antidepressants, dopamine agonists, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, disulfiram, opioid agonists, N-Acetylcysteine; without conclusive results. However in the past couple of years reviews have started to point out the promising effects of psychostimulants. Studies have mainly focused on prescription psychostimulants (PPs) such as modafinil, methylphenidate,or amphetamines (mixed amphetamine salts, lisdexamphetamine, and dextroamphetamine). Psychostimulant treatment has a similar pharmacological rationale as other evidence-based substitution treatments like nicotine replacement and opioid agonist therapies. An “agonist” medication would have a similar pharmacologic and behavioral effect as the drug of abuse, providing relief of craving and other symptoms of acute and protracted withdrawal. Treatment with PPs should be implemented cautiously due to the potential for euphoric effects and the risk of misuse and diversion. However, these medications are widely used for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and have overall good safety profile when used in healthy children and adults In our latest Best Practice Portal update we highlight a very recent meta-analysis that systematically reviewed trials testing selected PPs as treatment for patients with cocaine or amphetamine-type substance use disorder (PSUD). The pooled analysis found that prescription psychostimulants, particularly prescription amphetamines given in higher doses, have a clinically significant effect to promote abstinence in the treatment of individuals with PSUD, specifically the population with cocaine use disorder. The review suggests that a structured model of care using PPs similar to methadone clinics could be an alternative for outpatient medication-based intervention for patients with PSUDs, and calls for feasibility studies of this “agonist-type” pharmacological intervention. In real-world scenarios, one possible strategy is to offer treatment with prescription amphetamines in the setting of an opioid treatment programmes. Evidence summaries are available at the Best practice portal (BPP). Mindfulness for substance use disorders A new BPP update highlights structured mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) beneficial effects on craving management, as well as promising effects on psychiatric outcomes, including depression and anxiety symptoms. One of the key components of SUD is a desire (i.e. craving) to engage in substance use due to habit or a desire to increase momentary enjoyment or avoid discomfort. One of the primary aims of the manualised mindfulness-based protocols reviewed in the BPP is bringing focused attention to whatever is arising in the present moment (i.e. craving, sadness, pain, etc.) without judgment, and without a need to engage with, including actively avoiding, those feelings. Mitigating the sustained, motivated focus on substance-related cues, as well as the individual’s reaction to these cues, may prove to be one of the most beneficial aspects of MBIs in the treatment of SUD. mHealth: good news from the future Mobile health (mHealth) is defined as the use of mobile and wireless devices to deliver healthcare. Reactive or connected mHealth interventions collect data to provide customized responses to user input in real time. A new BPP entry highlights the results of a recent systematic review confirming the mounting evidence that mHealth interventions can be effective in reducing craving and substance use. Connected interventions may serve as an adjunct and/or an extension of traditional clinician delivered interventions. A more cost efficient and flexible alternative to in-person behavioral health services for individuals whose access to these services is impaired due to financial or logistic reasons. European Drugs Winter and Summer Schools Following the big success of the online Drugs Summer School 2020, and in order to keep our very popular face-to-face Summer School in Lisbon in 2021, next year we will organize two different Drugs School Events: an online Winter School (1-12th March 2021) with a special focus on ‘Responses and preparedness to health related threads (COVID-19 lessons learnt) a face-to-face Summer School in Lisbon (28th June-2nd July 2021) with a special focus on ‘Responses for Vulnerable groups’. For the Drugs Spring School, live sessions with experts and practitioners will be held in the early afternoon (Lisbon Time, GMT +1 to GMT +3/4). Virtual tours to field work will be included. Individual exercises sessions will be organised every day which will be corrected within 24 hours Webinar series The EMCDDA series of webinars will start again on the 12th of November with the Launch of the ESPAD report. The new series will include three types of webinars always in the form of conversation with key invitees: to launch EMCDDA products, to discuss new topics and with strategic partners. In all of them an EMCDDA chairperson will discuss with invitees who will also answer questions from the public. ESPAD webinar registration form.

EMCDDA_UNK_0060	2020-10-19	UNK	Registration opens for European Drugs Winter and Summer Schools 2021	 The EMCDDA and the University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL) are pleased to open registration today for two upcoming joint events in 2021: the European Drugs Winter School (EDWS) and the European Drugs Summer School (EDSS) (1)(2). EDWS 1–12 March 2021 (online): Following the success of the EDSS in 2020, taught remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the organisers have decided to deliver the first virtual EDWS in 2021. The theme of the event will be Responses to, and preparedness for, health-related threats (COVID-19 lessons learned). Following a similar structure to the 2020 edition, the two-week course will feature live lunchtime lectures with experts and practitioners, followed by afternoon exercises. Virtual fieldwork tours will also be offered. Completion of exercises and an exam are compulsory for those wishing to obtain credits. The sessions will be recorded and available for subsequent viewing. Increasing the offer of online training is in line with the EMCDDA’s digital transformation objectives. EDSS 28 June–9 July 2021 (Lisbon): This year, the two-week course will focus on Vulnerable groups. Sessions will include lectures on the prevention of drug-related problems; social determinants of drug use and interventions for vulnerable groups (homeless, prisoners, migrants). Study visits will be organised to one of the Portuguese commissions for dissuasion as well as a local harm reduction centre. During the course, students will participate in interactive workshops to discuss their own projects and views. The course will conclude with an open debate with guest speakers, followed by an exam for those wishing to obtain credits. All recommended COVID-19 safety measures will be put in place, if applicable. Deposits and fees will be reimbursed if the summer school is cancelled in case of force majeure, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The target audiences for the two events are: university students, researchers, professionals and administrators interested in working on drug issues. The previous rounds of the EDSS brought together students from the EU Member States as well as from Africa, Asia, Australia and the Americas. Profiles of former alumni and their testimonials can be found on the official summer school website and their statements viewed in a promotional video (3). The courses prepare professionals and students to meet the complex policy challenges that face Europe in the field of drugs. Involving scientific experts from the EMCDDA, university professors and policymakers, they provide a multi-disciplinary and inclusive approach to the study of the drugs problem in Europe and beyond. In 2021, students will again be able to apply for scholarships. Agreements with the IPA7 and EU4MD projects will also be sought for bursaries targeting key national experts. ‘Early-bird’ reductions will be available. The EDSS will be run in English. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/registration-opens-for-european-drugs-winter-and-summer-schools-2021_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0061	2020-10-01	UNK	News from EU4Monitoring Drugs, an EMCDDA technical cooperation project	 This content was published in the EU4MD update released on 01.10.2020. This update also presents a section on studies, upcoming events, and a research corner. Focus on the impact of COVID-19 on drug markets, use and services in the eastern ENP region On 28 September 2020, the EMCCDA released the first publication in the framework of the EU4Monitoring Drugs project, which presents the key results of an EMCDDA trendspotter study. This study was prepared in consultation with some 30 experts from all six eastern European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) countries. The report highlights the following changes in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic across the eastern ENP region: Drug markets — Signs of supply chain disruption were seen in a reduction in the volume and number of seizures at borders and in increases in retail-level prices for certain types of drugs in some countries. At retail level, contactless drug dealing activities prevailed, prompted by national restrictions on movement, heightened public order measures and strategies to restrict person-to-person contact. Law-enforcement activities were also affected, with fewer drug law offences reported, reflecting a shift in policing priorities towards ensuring public safety. Drug use and drug-related harms — Sources suggest that the availability of most illicit substances smuggled into the region (e.g. heroin, MDMA, amphetamines, cocaine) decreased, which is thought to have led to a reduction in their use. In some contexts, this appears to have resulted in greater use of licit substitutes (e.g. alcohol, pharmaceuticals), frequently in combination with illicit drugs. Cannabis use appears to be the least affected. Drug services — Drug-related services, in some countries, reduced their offer in the early lockdown period, restricting access for new clients. At the same time, in most of the six countries, drug services and NGOs adapted their policies and protocols to ensure the uninterrupted provision of treatment services (e.g. offering take-home OST, online consultations and mobile services for needle and syringe exchange). The report concludes that, in the coming months, national authorities may need to consider how to maintain innovative approaches adapted for service provision. They will also need to ensure that practitioners and law-enforcement officers are adequately equipped and skilled to work in the environment where online communication and digital tools may start to dominate. Read the report in English and summaries of the report in Azerbaijani, Armenian, Belarussian, Georgian, Ukrainian and Romanian. Spotlight on partner countries Republic of Moldova The EU4MD contact person on drug-related security matters in his country, Mr Dumitru Vleju, main officer in the Department for policy on preventing and combating crime in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Moldova, provides insight regarding the drug situation in the Republic of Moldova. He highlights the main challenges and threats faced and reflects on successful national efforts and his views on future cooperation with the EU4MD project. 1. What are the main drug-related challenges facing the Republic of Moldova? The internet-based drug trade is one of the main challenges we are currently facing. The increase in new online drug sales schemes leads to a diversity of drugs available on drug markets, especially new synthetic drugs. This somehow facilitates the access to a wide drug market that is more difficult to control.Moldova’s geographical location makes it increasingly attractive and convenient for illicit drug trafficking, thus, consolidating to some extent the ‘transit country’ status for Moldova.Drug possession for personal use remains a crime and, if a person is caught with illicit drugs for their personal use, this may lead to imprisonment. This practice of the criminal justice system, although obsolete, hinders the access of people who use drugs to treatment and their return to a healthy life within society. 2. What are the current security threats related to drugs in your country? This year has shown us how vulnerable law enforcement is in the hi-tech/IT domains. The main threat is caused by the following identified vulnerabilities; insufficient capacity to monitor online sales, the use of different social media and ‘messenger’ type applications, difficulty to detect online bots, proxy servers and, of course, delayed response by law enforcement.Historically, the main issue of drug trafficking has been ‘delivery’. Nowadays, this stage is well managed by the thousands of binary assistants controlled by one IT specialist. As a consequence, organised crime is increasingly reoriented to the IT sector and hi-tech technologies, thus switching from the offline world to the ‘online world’. This shift makes it difficult for law enforcement agencies to detect and trace drug-related operations, as well as to clearly differentiate between drug users and persons involved in drug-related criminal activities. 3. What has been done to address the challenges posed by drugs? In Moldova, we have been focusing on improving the regulatory framework by approving the new National Anti-Drug Strategy for 2020-2027. This policy document proposes a comprehensive, interdisciplinary and balanced approach to drug-related issues, based on integrated collaboration and evidence, focusing on decreasing the drugs demand, reducing drug supply, and conducting risk assessment.Furthermore, we focused on streamlining the strategic and operational cooperation with national law enforcement agencies and international counterparts and specialised organisations. 4. Where and how can the EU4MD project make a difference? We have already benefited from numerous capacity building activities through the project. We are confident that the project can further contribute towards enhancing our ability to respond to continuously evolving drug-related challenges and threats. From the perspective of the Ministry of the Interior, we would like to see more training on: the unique features of drug markets; criminal analysis; assessment of the impact of drug production on the environment; identification of ‘hot spots’; mapping drug production dynamics and trafficking; technological advancements and innovation; assessment and response to drug-related threats. We also hope to continue to exchange experiences with EU countries on developing anti-drug strategies. Finally, it is extremely important to enhance sharing of standard evidence and methodologies designed for the examination of psychotropic substances, their analogues and precursors. Palestine * Brigadier General Yousef Ozreil, Head of the National Programme of Drug Control, Crime Prevention and Enhanced Criminal Justice System and the EU4MD counterpart in Palestine, gives his views on the drug situation in his country, highlighting main challenges and threats, and reflecting on successful national efforts and his views on future cooperation with the EU4MD project. 1.  What are the main drug-related challenges facing Palestine? The drug problem remains a concern because it affects adversely not only our homeland in general but also our citizens. Control of illicit drug turnover is a national priority. Our administration has adopted workplans and implemented approaches based on several integrated axes with the ultimate aim of achieving a safe society. The Palestinian Police, and the Drug Control Department in particular, work hard to limit the spread of drugs and to control the routes of their smuggling, trade, distribution, and cultivation. Their work has contributed to a reduction in the supply and demand for drugs in addition to strengthening community awareness of the dangers of drug use. 2.  What are the current drug-related challenges? Our main concern remains drug-related crime. One of the issues is the illegal cultivation of narcotic substances in Palestine, especially in the border areas such as the east with Jordan, as well as the areas close to the separation barrier. We are also concerned about innovation and advanced technologies, such as using hydroponics in the cultivation process.‘Synthetic cannabis’ (our way of referring to synthetic cannabinoids) seems to have a market and demand in our population. There are also some indications of its production, and the main concern is the toxicity of these substances.Illicit drug use among young people may be increasing, according to the reports from my colleagues in the Ministry of Health.Israel has decriminalised recreational cannabis for personal use and the use of medicinal cannabis is emerging rapidly. There are many companies cultivating medical cannabis, and Israel is also one of the leading cannabis exporters to other countries which have introduced medicinal cannabis. In Israel, medicinal cannabis is sold in pharmacies and there seems to be growing demand for it. We are concerned that this trend may encourage cultivation in Palestine.The emergence of new ways and models for smuggling drugs is another challenge. This year in particular we have been concerned about the volume of drugs smuggled via express mail.Finally, the Palestinian Authority has limited control and monitoring of cross-border trafficking, and this mainly affects our ability to follow-up drug cases and prosecution for drug-related crime. Moreover, our legal framework and practices for the prosecution of drug-related crime remain weak, which opens the door for the dismissal of cases. 3.  What has been done to address the challenges posed by drugs? Our Drug Enforcement Administration is focusing on arresting and prosecuting drug traffickers, dealers, and those who have committed repeat offences. As a result, we have observed relocation of cultivation within the Palestinian lands and this business moving closer to the borders in the Jordan Valley and near the separation barrier 4.  Where and how the European Union can make a difference? EUPOL COPPS is one of our primary partners in the field of drug control, and cooperation is on-going and developing. So far it has provided us with technical and logistical support, equipment, and specialised courses to combat the scourge of drugs, as well as to learn about new methods of smuggling.  Since the start of the EU4Monitoring drugs project, our law enforcement officers have already attended several international training sessions with European partners. This experience should stimulate them to improve their practice when it comes to drug monitoring and reporting.

EMCDDA_UNK_0062	2020-09-30	UNK	Looking back on 25 years of annual reporting on the drugs problem in Europe	 This month, the EMCDDA's Scientific Director takes us on a journey through 25 years of annual reporting on the drugs problem in Europe. The journey begins with the first report describing the drug situation in 1995 and leads us, over key milestones, to the latest European Drug Report 2020. Looking back on a quarter of a century, two things stand out: first, Europe's drugs problem has evolved considerably over this period; and second, this evolution has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the quantity and quality of the information available on the topic. The article describes reporting through various EU enlargements, and on a rapidly changing drug landscape, and shows how information needs for informed policies have evolved over time. Feature article by Paul Griffiths, EMCDDA Scientific Director In 1996, the EMCDDA released its first annual report on drug trends in Europe, entitled the Annual report on the state of the drugs problem in the European Union 1995. This introduced the work of the agency and presented the limited data then available from European countries on drug use. EU aggregate estimates were largely absent at that time. Since then, although the report’s format and name have changed, the EMCDDA has continued to provide yearly assessments of drug use in Europe over a quarter of a century. Looking back at these 25 years of annual reporting, two things stand out: first, Europe’s drugs problem has evolved considerably over this period; and second, this evolution has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the quantity and quality of the information available on this topic. While today our information systems remain imperfect, they represent a major achievement of the European approach to addressing drug issues, as they now permit a far better understanding of the drug problems faced within the EU and the measures taken to address them.

The article covers: The Reitox network: key partners for building the European evidence base Meeting the challenges of a changing drug scene and EU enlargement The information needs for informed policies and actions have evolved over time Keeping pace with a more rapidly changing drug landscape The growing importance of stimulants, synthetic drugs and cannabis New psychoactive substances become an issue of concern Supply side data have become more important Preparing to meet the future challenges of reporting on drug use in Europe 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/looking-back-on-25-years-of-annual-reporting-on-the-drugs-problem-in-europe_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0063	2020-09-28	UNK	EMCDDA and Kosovo seal new agreement in Pristina 	 The EMCDDA and Kosovo* are signing a new Working Arrangement today which will pave the way for greater cooperation on monitoring the drug phenomenon in Europe and beyond its borders. Dignitaries attending the ceremony in Pristina are: Kosovo’s Minister of Internal Affairs, Agim Veliu; Minister of Health, Armend Zemaj; and the new EU Ambassador in Kosovo, Tomaš Szunyog. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel will participate in the ceremony virtually. The Working Arrangement originates in a request from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kosovo to the EMCDDA Director in 2018. After receiving the favourable opinion of the European Commission on the draft text in April 2020, the EMCDDA Management Board mandated the Director in June to sign the agreement. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the agreement was formalised through an exchange of letters and will be celebrated in today's ceremony between the EMCDDA and Pristina. This Working Arrangement is the second to be signed between the EMCDDA and a partner from the Western Balkans (the first being Albania in 2019). The new agreement provides for the exchange of expertise between the entities concerned, thus contributing to developing drug data-collection and reporting capacity in the region. The EMCDDA began its cooperation with Kosovo in 2009 in the framework of EU-funded technical assistance projects designed to prepare Western Balkan partners for accession to the EU (and for participation in the work of the EMCDDA and its Reitox network). Kosovo’s current drugs strategy, covering the period 2018–22, foresees the setting up of a drug observatory within the Secretariat for Strategies at the Ministry of Internal Affairs. This body will be tasked with gathering information and data from other institutions for analysis and evaluation, in order to prepare analytical reports for the National Drug Coordinator. Close cooperation between the EMCDDA and Kosovo’s Ministry of Internal Affairs has led, among others, to the financing of a General Population Survey on drug use and attitudes in Kosovo (2014) in line with EMCDDA protocols. Kosovo is one of the six partners currently receiving assistance under the EMCDDA IPA 7 project, running from July 2019 to June 2022. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/emcdda-and-kosovo-seal-new-agreement-in-pristina_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0064	2020-09-28	UNK	EMCDDA releases study findings on the impact of COVID-19 on drug markets, use and services in the eastern ENP region	 The expansion of contactless drug dealing, the increase in the use of licit drugs and the adaptation of drug treatment protocols during lockdown are among the findings highlighted today in a new EMCDDA report: Impact of COVID-19 on drug markets, drug use, drug-related harms and responses in east European Neighbourhood Policy countries. This is the first publication released in the framework of the EMCDDA EU4Monitoring Drugs project, funded by the EU and launched in 2019. The project paves the way for the agency to cooperate and exchange data more readily with the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) partner countries (1). Today’s report presents the key results of an EMCDDA trendspotter study, prepared in consultation with some 30 experts from all six eastern ENP countries (2). A summary of the report in English is available in Azerbaijani, Armenian, Belarussian, Georgian, Ukrainian and Romanian. The report highlights the following changes in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic across the eastern European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) region: Drug markets — Signs of supply chain disruption were seen in a reduction in the volume and number of seizures at borders and in increases in retail-level prices for certain types of drugs in some countries. At retail level, contactless drug dealing activities prevailed, prompted by national restrictions on movement, heightened public order measures and strategies to restrict person-to-person contact. Law-enforcement activities were also affected, with fewer drug law offences reported, reflecting a shift in policing priorities towards ensuring public safety. Drug use and drug-related harms — Sources suggest that the availability of most illicit substances smuggled into the region (e.g. heroin, MDMA, amphetamines, cocaine) decreased, which is thought to have led to a reduction in their use. In some contexts, this appears to have resulted in greater use of licit substitutes (e.g. alcohol, pharmaceuticals), frequently in combination with illicit drugs. Cannabis use appears to be the least affected. Drug services — Drug-related services, in some countries, reduced their offer in the early lockdown period, restricting access for new clients. At the same time, in most of the six countries, drug services and NGOs adapted their policies and protocols to ensure the uninterrupted provision of treatment services (e.g. offering take-home OST, online consultations and mobile services for needle and syringe exchange). The report concludes that, in the coming months, national authorities may need to consider how to maintain innovative approaches adapted for service provision. They will also need to ensure that practitioners and law-enforcement officers are adequately equipped and skilled to work in the environment where online communication and digital tools may start to dominate. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/impact-of-covid-19-on-drug-markets-use-and-services-in-the-eastern-enp-region_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0065	2020-09-22	UNK	COVID-19 disruption and a strong drug market bring new threats to health and security in Europe	 High availability across all drug types, drug production within Europe and highly potent substances are among the concerns addressed today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in its European Drug Report 2020: Trends and Developments (1). In its latest annual review — marking 25 years of monitoring — the agency describes the drug situation at the end of 2019, along with recent changes brought by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. New developments highlighted in the report include: record cocaine, and large heroin, seizures; a scaling up of synthetic drug production; and concerns around high-potency cannabis, new synthetic opioids and ecstasy tablets containing high levels of MDMA. Drawing on new EMCDDA rapid studies (Spring 2020) (2), the report also reviews COVID-19 disruption to drug use and the market, which could have long-term implications for Europe’s drug services and law enforcement agencies. There are fears that innovative drug distribution models developed during lockdown, along with the economic impact of the pandemic on vulnerable communities, will add to the challenges already posed by an abundant supply of drugs. European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson says: ‘The European Drug Report 2020 underlines the dangers posed by the production and trafficking of illicit drugs to the health and security of EU citizens. The operation of lucrative drug markets by organised crime groups, and the record levels of cocaine and high volumes of heroin seized, highlights the persistent threat presented by criminals seeking to exploit supply chains, shipping routes and large ports to traffic drugs. The increased availability of all types of illicit drugs exacerbates the health risks. The EU’s new Agenda and Action Plan on Drugs 2021–25 provides the political and strategic framework to effectively and comprehensively address drug-related security and public health challenges through the deployment of all relevant instruments at local, national, EU and international level.’ Europe’s drug situation up to 2020: highlights The following ‘Key issues’ have been identified in this year’s analysis:Large drug shipments are increasingly intercepted — A rise in the seizure of large quantities of cocaine, cannabis resin and, increasingly heroin, transported by sea, raises concerns around organised crime groups infiltrating legitimate supply chains, shipping routes and large ports. Cocaine’s role in Europe’s drug problem is increasing — Cocaine purity has increased and more people are entering treatment for the first time. Cocaine seizures are at an all-time high (181 tonnes, 110 000 seizures). Potential for increased heroin use and existing harms raise concerns — The volume of heroin seized in the EU nearly doubled between 2017 and 2018 (rising from 5.2 to 9.7 tonnes) and there are continued reports of some heroin manufacturing within the EU. This suggests that more vigilance is needed to detect any signs of increased consumer interest in this drug. Access to opioid substitution treatment remains limited in some countries.Understanding the public health impact of high-potency cannabis and new products — Cannabis resin and herb now contain, on average, around twice as much THC as they did a decade ago. This calls for close monitoring of the market at a time when new forms of cannabis are also appearing (e.g. concentrates, edibles). Increased and diverse drug production within Europe — Established and new drugs continue to be produced in Europe for local and global markets, with more laboratories and production sites detected and a more diverse set of chemicals used. Continuing availability of high-strength MDMA products highlights need for greater user awareness — Innovation and scaling-up of synthetic drug production in Europe is evident in the continued availability of high-content MDMA tablets and high-purity powders, which pose considerable health risks for consumers. This underlines the need for interventions that tackle drug use harms in recreational settings. Growing complexity in the drug market poses regulatory challenges and health risks — Less-common and uncontrolled substances appear to be a growing problem in some countries, with more ketamine, GHB and LSD being seized and concerns over the use of nitrous oxide (laughing gas) and new benzodiazepines. Need for new tools and innovative strategies to support the scaling-up of hepatitis C treatment — Scaling up access for people who inject drugs to prevention, testing and treatment for hepatitis C is critical for eliminating the infection in this group. The introduction of better diagnostic and surveillance techniques to identify those chronically infected is important for targeting treatment. Drug overdose is increasingly associated with an ageing population — Overdoses in the 50-plus age group increased by 75% between 2012 and 2018; an estimated 8 300 overdose deaths occurred in the EU in 2018. Opioid overdose deaths can be prevented through the timely administration of naloxone. New psychoactive substances (NPS) have become a more persistent problem— Over the past three years, NPS have been detected for the first time in Europe at the rate of around one per week; 53 substances were detected in 2019. Appearance of novel synthetic opioids is a worrying example of continuing market adaptability — Eight uncontrolled new synthetic opioids, some from diverse and new groups, were detected for the first time in 2019, raising fresh public health concerns. COVID-19 disruption: challenges Presenting findings from EMCDDA rapid studies, the report describes how many drug services were forced to close, or limit their offer, in the early lockdown period but managed to adapt and innovate (e.g. via telemedicine) to provide rapid access to treatment and other support. The initial impact of the crisis on patterns of drug use was mixed, with signs of declining interest in substances that are commonly used in social settings (e.g. MDMA, cocaine) but apparent increased use of other substances in some groups (e.g. cannabis, new benzodiazepines). Initially, supplies of substances on local drug markets were disrupted, resulting in shortages and higher prices, but this may revert as social distancing measures are relaxed. The report also reveals how organised crime groups quickly adapted their modi operandi, particularly at retail level. With street dealing affected by restrictions on movement, consumers and dealers turned to the use of online darknet markets, social media platforms and parcel and home delivery services. Monitoring of the drug market suggested that, at wholesale level, smuggling by air passenger transport declined, but trafficking by maritime shipping continued at pre-pandemic levels. Synthetic drug production and cannabis cultivation in Europe also did not appear to be seriously affected. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘The COVID-19 pandemic has had an immediate, disruptive impact on drug use, retail supply and services and has highlighted the special needs of people who use drugs. While the long-term impact of the pandemic remains to be assessed, in the short-term we are already noting changes, such as greater interest in the use of digital technologies in the drug market and innovation in drug treatment through e- and m-health solutions. We must be concerned, however, that, as the economic repercussions of the crisis take effect, some in our communities may become more vulnerable to drug problems and drug market involvement, putting greater pressure on our already stretched services. It is essential therefore that we act rapidly to identify and address new threats that may emerge from this fast-evolving situation.’ Chair of the EMCDDA Management Board Laura d’Arrigo concludes: ‘As we launch this year’s European Drug Report and mark the EMCDDA’s 25 years of monitoring, we are faced with a challenging drugs problem, exacerbated by the effects of COVID-19. The European balanced approach to the drug phenomenon is key to responding to the complex health and security threats posed by illicit drugs. Today’s report reminds us that, more than ever, an objective assessment of the drugs situation in Europe is crucial for identifying effective responses and charting the way forward together’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/7/european-drug-report-2020-highlights_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0066	2020-09-22	UNK	Speech by Alexis Goosdeel: European Drug Report 2020: Trends and Developments — Key findings 	 Occasion: Virtual event, European Drug Report 2020: Trends and Developments — Key findings Introduction Good morning, It is my pleasure to present to you the new report on the drug situation in Europe and it is a privilege to present it to you with Mrs Ylva Johansson, European Commissioner for Home Affairs and with Mrs Laura d’Arrigo, Chair of the Management Board of the EMCDDA. I will present you today with the key findings resulting from all the data collected up to 2020, including statistical data collected until the end of last year and more recent data coming from rapid studies that we have launched to follow and assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am going to present to you three main findings... Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic Let's have a look at the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are three main impacts of the pandemic on the drug situation in Europe this year. Impact on services First of all, services were severely disrupted at the beginning of the pandemic and in the first weeks and months of the lockdown. This resulted in the closure, or very important reduction, in the availability of treatment and harm-reduction services and a lack of access of practitioners to protective equipment. Luckily, this was followed by a much more positive movement, where we have seen a lot of innovation and creativity from all services, such as more e-health or m-health activities or applications, more telemedicine and installing new partnerships with the client. Impact on drug use Second, the impact on drug use. There was some reduction in the use of substances usually consumed in recreational settings, such as cocaine or ecstasy (also called MDMA). For other groups of substances, we have seen an increase. This is namely the case for the use of cannabis, the use of benzodiazepines and the use of alcohol, frequently in combination with one or other of the substances that I have mentioned. For a third group of substances, the picture is not so clear. Here we are talking about other stimulants and amphetamines, where the decrease was not as important as we expected. Impact on organised crime Third, the impact of COVID-19 on organised crime. Organised crime groups have been extremely resilient. We can say that the pandemic has boosted, not only digital transformation for the licit economy but also for the illicit economy. Evolution of the European drug market Let's have a look at the evolution of the drug market in the recent months and at its possible impact and risks for public health and also for public security and safety. Three main findings: what does it mean and what is the impact for the European citizen? Higher availability of all drugs in Europe First, higher availability of all drugs, but also highest purity and highest potency ever seen for the substances. This raises a lot of risks and questions regarding also the potential harm for consumers who do not realise this important change in the potency and the likely negative health consequences. Growing importance of large shipments Large shipments are becoming the main way of conveying these drugs to the European territory. This raises concerns regarding the possible infiltration by organised crime groups of the legitimate supply chain (and all the economy around), the risk for corruption and money laundering and the increase of drug-related violence and other crime. Growing diversification of production Finally, diversification of production is bringing a completely different picture: increased production of cannabis, of ecstasy on the European territory and the appearance of new laboratories producing new substances. These include new synthetic opioids, such as fentanyls, which raise a lot of concerns and certainly ring the alarm. Drug use and drug-related harms Finally, let's have a look at what has changed concerning drug use and drug-related harms. Plant-based substances If we look at plant-based substances — here we are talking about cocaine, cannabis and heroin — we start seeing the first effects of the increased availability of cocaine in the form of problem use of cocaine and some increase in the demand for treatment that is caused by this problem use. This is only the beginning. We also see and observe from some low-threshold programmes located in different cities in Europe the first effects of the increased availability of crack cocaine. Cannabis has seen its concentration in THC doubling over the last decade. These new concentrations have the potential to create more health problems, including mental health problems. Synthetic drugs But there is a second group of substances. The chemicals, the synthetic drugs. It encompasses different groups of substances: ecstasy (or MDMA), amphetamines, methamphetamines, new psychoactive substances (with new synthetic opioids and new benzodiazepines). And finally, we have seen in recent years, an increase in the seizures of GHB, ketamine and LSD. And if we look at the situation in particular of new psychoactive substances, we detect through the EU Early Warning System one new substance per week on the European market. So, these changes and this evolution are very important, because they are not bringing the same profile of drug use as 25 years ago when the EMCDDA started its operations. Drugs have changed, they are less visible, but they are more disseminated throughout society and we need to remain vigilant and continue to protect the citizens. Health consequences In terms of protection, the health consequences of drug use remain an important concern. There is some good news and there are some good perspectives, but there are also new needs. The EU made a very strong commitment to eradicating hepatitis C. This objective cannot be reached if people who are using drugs are not covered by, and are not participating in, and associated with, better testing and better interventions. And last is the evolution of drug-related deaths. In 2018, there were around 9 000 drug-related deaths in Europe (over 8 000 in the EU), most of them associated with opioid use, frequently in combination with other substances, such as benzodiazepines. What we have observed in recent years is that there is one specific group of people who are using drugs and who are suffering more from deadly overdose. Drug deaths have increased in the 50+ age group by more by 75%. This reflects the fact that there is an ageing population that continues to use opioids. There is an urgent need to provide more appropriate, better tailored treatment and support for these persons. Conclusions This was the picture that we wanted to share with you on the occasion of the launch of this new report. What we have learned from the pandemic is that some things can go worse. Of course. But there is fresh hope. For instance, with the creativity and innovation that has been developed and shown by many treatment programmes and harm-reduction services. These services managed to recover from the negative and disruptive effect of the measures taken to cope with the pandemic and managed to develop new ways to work in partnership and in association with people who are using drugs. For us, and for the European Union, there is a need to continue to monitor carefully these new emerging changes to assess the possible consequences in the long term. In particular, we need, and we want, to pay careful attention to what will happen in the next months. Everybody expects a very important economic recession that could increase the vulnerability of some groups in the population that are already very vulnerable. Also, there is a potential risk that, because of this more challenging economic situation, we could have more people entering drug-related (directly or indirectly) criminal activities. This shows that the approach that is developed at the EU level, and the work of the EMCDDA, has a direct impact or direct scope to provide support for a better, healthier and more secure Europe as far as drugs are concerned.

EMCDDA_UNK_0067	2020-09-08	UNK	Save the date: European Drug Report 2020 to be released on 22 September	 How is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting drug use, supply and services? What are the health costs of drug use in Europe today? What do the latest data tell us about drug production and trafficking trends? Be the first to know when the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) launches its European Drug Report 2020: Trends and Developments in a live online media event on 22 September. In this latest annual review — marking 25 years of monitoring — the EMCDDA describes the drug situation at the end of 2019, along with recent changes brought by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. The report (in English) provides a comprehensive analysis of patterns emerging across the EU, Turkey and Norway in the areas of drug supply, illicit drug use and associated public health problems. National data sets are also provided across these themes and on key harm-reduction interventions. In a new format, chapters are organised primarily by drug type and by related harms. The publication is an essential resource for developing evidence-based policy and action and provides a valuable baseline against which future changes in the drugs field can be measured. Accompanying the report this year will be a Key Issues summary (in 24 languages), presenting a selection of the main findings from the latest analysis, chosen for their policy relevance and general interest. The 2020 Statistical Bulletin, containing the European dataset underpinning the report, will also be available. Attend the live online media event to hear the key issues and latest analysis.

EMCDDA_UNK_0068	2020-08-31	UNK	Facts and myths about overdose and take-home naloxone — EMCDDA publishes new resources	 Over the past five years, more than 40 000 people have died of a drug-related overdose in the European Union and the UK; around 80% of these being linked to the use of heroin or other opioids. Yet, with effective intervention, they could have been prevented. Today, on International Overdose Awareness Day, the EMCDDA is launching a new set of resources designed to improve understanding of drug overdoses and responses to them in Europe. These have been developed under the agency’s harm-reduction initiative, through which it aims to support countries’ actions to prevent overdose and reduce overdose-related mortality, ultimately contributing to a healthier Europe (EMCDDA Strategy 2025). The initiative consists of a rolling programme of activities which target specific areas of harm reduction practice, build on the evidence base in this area and deliver relevant tools for policy and practice. Take-home naloxone can save lives — an overview of programmes Many people overdose in the presence of their partners or peers. Empowering friends, family and other bystanders to act effectively, before emergency services arrive at the scene, can therefore save lives. Overdose prevention programmes, combining first aid training with the provision of the overdose-reversal drug naloxone, were piloted in Europe in the late 1990s. Now available at local or national level in 12 European countries, these take-home naloxone (THN) programmes are targeted at-risk opioid users and those likely to witness an overdose. The EMCDDA publishes today updated country profiles and factsheets from the 12 countries concerned, providing a state-of-the-art overview of THN programmes in Europe. These show how programmes have been enhanced through the availability of new ready-to-use naloxone products (e.g. pre-filled syringes and nasal naloxone sprays), which can be used by laypeople outside healthcare structures. Test your knowledge: new online questionnaire on overdose and take-home naloxone The EMCDDA also launches today a new online knowledge questionnaire on overdose and take-home naloxone aimed at potential bystanders of overdose, but also at a wider interested public. The main aim of the questionnaire is to refresh respondents’ knowledge on opioids, overdose risks and the role of take-home naloxone as part of the overall response to overdose deaths. The questionnaire can be used as a practical tool by those implementing overdose prevention and response training with people who use drugs as well as with their next of kin, staff of drug treatment centres or police and prison staff. The questionnaire addresses a range of issues regarding heroin and other opioids; opioid overdose; overdose risk; and myths and facts about overdose and take-home naloxone. Available in four languages (ES, DE, EN, FR), the questionnaire consists of a series of true statements with an answer format ‘I knew it already’ or ‘This is new to me’. This allows participants to ‘learn by doing’ and assess and refresh their own level of knowledge. Click here to test your knowledge. 25 years of monitoring drug-related deaths in Europe Over the past 25 years, the EMCDDA has been monitoring the number and characteristics of drug-related deaths in its Member States. In the early years of its existence, driven by the need to harmonise information from all countries, the agency adopted an epidemiological indicator defining how drug-related mortality and drug-induced deaths should be measured and reported. The European definition of drug-related deaths, developed by the agency and national experts, has since been translated into a set of codes and criteria allowing for the extraction of relevant cases from mortality registers. This indicator became part of the set of European Core Health Indicators (ECHI) in 2005. In the context of its work on responses to drug-related deaths, the EMCDDA has also developed a comprehensive model of interventions showing how overdose prevention can be addressed on three levels: reducing vulnerability to overdose; reducing the risk of opioid-related overdose and reducing fatal outcomes should an overdose occur (see graphic). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/facts-and-myths-about-overdose-and-take-home-naloxone-emcdda-publishes-new-resources_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0069	2020-07-28	UNK	World Hepatitis Day: EMCDDA showcases hepatitis questionnaire for drug service staff to refresh knowledge and identify training needs	 Every year, on 28 July, the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners mark World Hepatitis Day to increase awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis and the diseases it causes. It is estimated that around 290 million people worldwide are living with viral hepatitis, and many remain unaware of their status. Failure to identify the undiagnosed, and link them to care, means that millions will continue to suffer and lives will be lost. The focus of this year’s campaign is therefore ‘Find the missing millions.’ Transmitted through the sharing of needles, syringes and other injecting equipment, hepatitis C is the most common infectious disease among people who inject drugs in Europe. If HCV infection in this group is not addressed, there may be considerable costs in the future, both to individuals and to health budgets. As part of its harm reduction initiative to increase access to hepatitis C testing and improve linkage to care, the EMCDDA is showcasing today its knowledge questionnaire designed for those working in drug treatment settings. The main aim of the questionnaire is to: allow those working in these services to refresh their knowledge on the hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV), including transmission, testing and care for people who inject drugs. The questionnaire also provides a practical tool for managers of drug treatment facilities to identify staff training needs and increases awareness among drug service staff of the importance of knowing their own HCV status. The knowledge questionnaire, now available in seven languages (German, English, French, Italian, Dutch, Polish and Portuguese), covers a wide range of issues, including HCV and HBV prevalence, routes of transmission, prevention measures, treatment and testing options and international testing and treatment recommendations. This practical tool, which can be administered on paper or adapted to an online version, consists of a series of true statements which provide factual information on viral hepatitis. The answer format — ‘I knew it already’ or ‘This is new to me’ — allows participants to ‘learn by doing’ and to assess their own level of knowledge and refresh it. The EMCDDA has created an online version of the survey in English as an example. Click here to test your knowledge. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘Staff working in drug services play a vital role, both in reaching people who may be at risk of hepatitis infections, and in linking them to care. They are an important source for informing people who inject drugs about infection risks and prevention, about available tests and effective treatment and about the type of medical services they provide on-site. This questionnaire can help ensure that drug service professionals have up-to-date knowledge on viral hepatitis in order to help people who inject drugs access the care they need’. Over the past 25 years, the EMCDDA has been monitoring the prevalence and incidence of blood-borne virus infections among people who inject drugs. In 1997, it published its first estimate of the burden of hepatitis C among this group, which highlighted the extent of what had, until then, been a ‘hidden epidemic’ in the shadow of HIV/AIDS. This triggered further research into the impact, costs and policy options regarding this disease, leading to an overview on the issue published in 2004. In the following years, the agency focused on identifying effective responses to prevent and reduce injecting-related harms and making this information available to policymakers and practitioners across Europe. Yet, despite the availability of new highly effective treatments for hepatitis C infection, access to testing and care for people who inject drugs still remains limited today. In line with countries’ commitment to eliminate hepatitis C as a public health threat by 2030 (1), the EMCDDA launched a new harm reduction initiative on hepatitis C in 2018. Through this initiative, the agency now offers a set of practical resources aimed at supporting countries in promoting HCV testing and care for this vulnerable group through drug services. #WorldHepatitisDay #FindTheMissingMillions #emcdda25 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/world-hepatitis-day-emcdda-showcases-hepatitis-questionnaire-for-drug-service-staff_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0070	2020-07-14	UNK	Stronger together: EU agencies join forces to respond to COVID-19 	 Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the nine JHA agencies (CEPOL, EASO, EIGE, EMCDDA, eu-LISA, Eurojust, Europol, FRA and Frontex) have been supporting the EU Member States and institutions in meeting the unprecedented challenges resulting from the outbreak of the virus in both the short and long term. Over the past months, all JHA agencies have taken the necessary measures to ensure business continuity and uninterrupted operational support in their respective areas of work. At the same time, the Justice and Home Affairs agencies' network (JHAAN), under the chair of Eurojust, has initiated a dialogue to share its experiences in dealing with the pandemic and to consider new avenues for closer cooperation among the agencies and with key stakeholders inside and outside the EU. The agencies’ individual and joint efforts to deal with the impact of the pandemic have been captured in a Joint Paper on the COVID-19 response by the JHA agencies, which was formally endorsed by the Heads of JHA agencies during a video conference held on 9 July. During their meeting, the Heads discussed the latest developments, including the fundamental rights implications of government COVID-19 measures, the quick adaptation of organised crime to the changing circumstances and the recent surge in drug use, domestic violence and child abuse. To tackle these and other issues related to the protection of citizens and freedoms more effectively, there is a need, in the coming years, for increased inter-agency cooperation in the field of digitalisation and for sustainable financial resources. The COVID-19 pandemic coincides with the 10th anniversary of the Justice and Home Affairs agencies' network. In the past decade, this family of JHA agencies has joined forces as guardians of the area of Freedom, Security and Justice. Together, they have contributed to the implementation of the EU’s objectives in the fields of migration, asylum and external border management, the fight against serious organised crime, drug trafficking and terrorism, gender equality and respect for fundamental rights. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/stronger-together-eu-agencies-join-forces-respond-covid-19_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0071	2020-06-30	UNK	EMCDDA welcomes external partners to virtual event on lessons learned from the impact of COVID-19 on the drug situation in Europe	 The EMCDDA will be joined by a range of its external partners today in a virtual event following on from International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking (26 June). The meeting is a symbolic gathering of representatives of the European Commission, the Permanent Missions representing the partner countries in Brussels, the Delegations of the European Union in these countries and the partner countries’ national correspondents. Reflecting the theme for this year’s international day — ‘Better knowledge for better care’ — EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel will deliver a keynote speech on lessons learned regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the drug situation in Europe. Mr Goosdeel spoke on this subject at a special event of the United Nations’ Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) on 26 June, which included regional perspectives on the impact of the pandemic on the world drug situation. Mr Goosdeel’s presentation today will be followed by a reflection by a German external expert and a Q&A session. The EMCDDA has a long history of cooperating with external partners through the signing of Working Arrangements or Memoranda of Understanding as well as through EU-funded technical cooperation projects, implemented by the agency since 1999. Currently, the EMCDDA cooperates with the Western Balkans through the IPA 7 project. This aims to set up and support national drug observatories and increase the evidence base on the drug situation in the region through stronger drug monitoring systems and the exchange of best practice. Regarding the European neighbouring countries, the EMCDDA established the EU4Monitoring Drugs project (EU4MD) in 2019, which makes a link between drug-related problems and security and health threats in the European Union and its neighbourhood countries. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/virtual-event-on-lessons-learned-from-the-impact-of-COVID-19-on-the-drug-situation-in-Europe_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0072	2020-06-26	UNK	EMCDDA and Europol join EU institutions in dialogue on the impact of COVID-19 on the world drug situation 	 On the occasion of International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking, the EMCDDA and Europol are joining representatives of the EU institutions today in providing the European perspective on the impact of COVID-19 on the world drug situation. The panel discussion will conclude a special event of the United Nations’ Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) and is co-sponsored by the European Union and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)(1). In a statement marking the day, European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson said: ‘The route from drug producer, to distributer, to user, and indeed to money launderer, is becoming ever more sophisticated, more circuitous and more profitable. In recent years, illicit drugs have increased in availability, with technology enabling online trade, postal dispatch, and hidden profits throughout the EU. Modern organised crime needs a modern organised response. We will soon present a robust and ambitious EU action on tackling drug smugglers, improving prevention strategies and targeting those who profit from others’ addiction'. Floriana Sipala, Head of the Organised Crime and Drugs Policy Unit at the European Commission, will present the opening remarks on the CND panel, followed by a speech from Europol Executive Director Catherine De Bolle. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel will deliver the closing remarks (2). The EMCDDA and Europol have been ‘taking the pulse’ of the impact of COVID-19 on drug use, drug services and drug markets. In a report published last month (3), they explored drug market developments under the pandemic and their impact on public health and security in the EU. The analysis reported higher prices, local shortages and reduced purity for some drugs, while noting continued violence among suppliers and distributors. It also described how organised crime groups have remained active and resilient, by adapting transportation models, trafficking routes and concealment methods during the pandemic. Speaking today, Catherine De Bolle said: ‘The pandemic has had a major impact on our lives, and is slowing down our economy. Unfortunately, this downturn has not been seen in international drugs trafficking. While our legal economy is weakening, criminal markets have continued their business and have become even stronger, generating huge profits. The movement of bulk quantities of drugs to the European Union and between EU Member States has continued and seizures of illegal drugs in some EU countries during the first half of 2020 have been higher than in the same months of previous years’. ‘More than ever, this worrying trend should motivate us to ensure that any recovery from the pandemic is accompanied by a strong and effective law enforcement response, combined with a sustained public health response. We need to collectively establish that drug traffickers do not benefit from the potential social and economic consequences of the crisis’, Executive Director De Bolle added. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel declared: ‘The economic recession that we have in front of us is likely to be harmful in terms of mental and physical health and could result in a significant increase of substance use in the general population. It can be expected that it will amplify the negative consequences of the pandemic for people who are using drugs and for vulnerable groups in general. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to integrate drug-related services into the essential health services at national level, to provide adequate equipment and tools for frontline workers, and to maintain the funding and functioning of drug-related services in the post-pandemic period.’ Alexis Goosdeel concluded: ‘The way in which the different services and authorities have been working together in the European Union in the times of this pandemic has shown that the “balanced approach” of the EU drugs policy has contributed to care and to protect, rather than to punish’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/5/emcdda-and-europol-join-eu-institutions-in-dialogue-on-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-the-world-drug-situation_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0073	2020-06-26	UNK	Speech by Alexis Goosdeel: Closing remarks on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world drug situation — the European perspective 	 Occasion: Closing remarks on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world drug situation — the European perspective Thank you Chairperson and colleagues, I am pleased to provide some closing remarks to this CND special event commemorating the United Nations International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking. We were privileged to hear the highlights from this year’s World Drug Report and to take part in a rich, and highly relevant, discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world drug situation. The EMCDDA would like to align itself with the comments of UNODC and, in particular, our close European partner — Europol. In the last three months, using an array of methods, we have been ‘taking the pulse’ of the impact of COVID-19 in three areas: drug use, drug services and drug markets. Let me start by highlighting some of the implications of COVID-19 for people who use drugs. I am very pleased that my Europol counterpart singled this issue out by stressing the implications for Europe’s ageing cohort of opioid users who may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 –– due to lifestyle factors or underlying chronic medical conditions. I would like to add that there is potentially a greater risk of opioid-related deaths (due to situations aggravated by the breathing difficulties caused by COVID-19) and the prospect of problems linked to sharing drug-using equipment. It is vital to ensure that services are properly resourced, staff protection measures are in place and service planning is prioritised. Ensuring the ongoing provision of drug treatment services, including opioid substitution medications and other essential medicines to clients, is paramount. Drug use behaviours, as well as poor socio-economic conditions and marginalisation, pose additional risks and, I wish to underline once more, the importance of targeted preventive measures in drug services, homeless shelters and prisons. The current pandemic has had a disruptive impact on the drug phenomenon in Europe in multiple ways and some of the repercussions may be long-lasting. Timely and good quality data would be critical to meaningfully follow up continuing developments and to identify changes that may require an immediate policy, or operational, response. The pandemic has revealed that we need to modernise our data collection, be able to produce evidence much faster and, very importantly, employ the new evidence to boost timely and proactive responses. It has also demonstrated that the continuity of care for drug-related services could not always be guaranteed, which, in turn, has had negative consequences for health and social professionals and for clients from those services. While the restrictions are gradually being lifted, it is very likely that some of the new practices will persist, as they may be more convenient for consumers and suppliers. An increase in the use of digital, communication and cyber-based technologies by drug trafficking organisations can be expected. As one-to-one encrypted communication services or social media apps are increasingly being used, monitoring and interdiction will become much more challenging. A key question here is whether more people will become used to a new form of purchasing their drugs and whether they will continue with it post COVID-19 lockdown. Although it is too early to assess what will remain of the changes brought by the COVID-19 pandemic on drug markets and drug use in the European Union, we can expect that the pandemic had, and will continue to have, an impact on the main drivers of drug markets, which will require closer monitoring in the years to come. The economic recession that we have in front of us is likely to be harmful in terms of mental and physical health and could result in a significant increase of substance use in the general population. It can be expected that it will amplify the negative consequences of the pandemic for people who are using drugs and for vulnerable groups in general. Our European agencies are working closely together to strengthen our respective operational and strategic analysis capacity, and to build on our experience of quickly addressing new emerging needs during the COVID-19 pandemic to further adapt our respective business models. More than ever, our objective is to anticipate emerging threats even better and to inform policy, decision-making and operational responses. There is now a critical need to identify areas where rapid adaptations to operational responses and future policies are required. Learning the lessons from COVID-19 to strengthen the EU’s preparedness in the perspective of a possible new outbreak of the epidemic, the Directors of the EMCDDA, ECDC and Europol invite the EU institutions and the Member States: to strengthen rapid data collection, information exchange and intelligence, and analysis to inform immediate cross-border public health and security policy and operational responses; to integrate drug-related services into the essential health services at national level, and to provide adequate equipment and tools for frontline workers; to build on the positive results of changes and innovations that have been brought by the practitioners of drugs services in close cooperation with their clients; to maintain the funding and functioning of drug-related services in the post COVID-19 period; to support the development of new tools and methods that are needed to address the new operational and strategic challenges caused by changes in the drug market from production and trafficking to distribution and use; to strengthen cooperation and coordination between institutions and official authorities, both at European and at national level. The way in which the different services and authorities have been working together in the European Union in the times of this pandemic has shown that the ‘balanced approach’ of the EU drugs policy has contributed to care and to protect, rather than to punish. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/speeches/2020/closing-remarks-on-the-impact-of-the-COVID-19-pandemic-on-the-world-drug-situation_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0074	2020-06-25	UNK	EMCDDA Management Board renews mandate of Alexis Goosdeel	 The EMCDDA Management Board took the unanimous decision today to renew the mandate of the agency’s Director, Alexis Goosdeel, for the next five years. Mr Goosdeel took up the post of EMCDDA Director on 1 January 2016 and will now hold the position until 31 December 2025. Chair of the EMCDDA Management Board Laura d’Arrigo welcomed the re-appointment stating: ‘I congratulate Mr Goosdeel on the renewal of his mandate. It shows the recognition by the Management Board of his vision for the EMCDDA and of the work accomplished under his guidance. The Director and his team have delivered first-rate results over this period, while demonstrating their ability and agility to adapt to unprecedented change. I wish him all the best for the next term at the helm of this forward-looking agency'. On taking up his post in 2016, Mr Goosdeel (Belgium) launched EMCDDA Strategy 2025, a long-term strategic and operational plan, presenting a vision to contribute to a ‘healthier and more secure Europe’ through better informed drug policy and action. Mr Goosdeel swiftly restructured the agency and its priorities to align with the strategy, mirroring the two pillars of public health and security. This year, the agency is delivering on the strategy’s Roadmap 2020, while designing the new Roadmap 2025. During his first term, Mr Goosdeel paid special attention to initiating a project management programme and performance management system and progressively moving the agency towards a service-oriented model to provide more tailored analyses and services to its primary customer groups. In 2019, the EMCDDA achieved its highest operational and financial performance to date and received a positive fourth external evaluation for the period 2013–18. The latter highlighted the EMCDDA as a true hub of scientific excellence, both in Europe and internationally. Since March 2020, COVID-19 has put the EMCDDA’s responsiveness to the test, both in terms of business continuity and monitoring the drug phenomenon. Under Mr Goosdeel’s guidance, the agency has acted quickly and proactively to adapt its working methods and production cycles to address new problems and needs. ‘Taking the pulse’ of the impact of COVID-19, it has published an array of resources which explore drug market changes and the challenges faced by people who use drugs as well as the frontline services supporting them. The agency has also provided new services to drug users and to professionals working in the drugs field. Reacting to the decision, Alexis Goosdeel said: ‘It is an honour and a privilege to be reappointed today to take the EMCDDA forward on an ambitious course of travel to 2025. The agency has an exciting future ahead of it and is ready to innovate and re-invent itself as required within the boundaries of its remit. My renewal comes in the year when the EMCDDA is celebrating an important milestone: its 25 years of monitoring. Little could we have imagined a few months ago what a special year this would turn out to be, and we are now more convinced than ever of the need to keep pace with new threats and developments. In an era when digital transformation becomes vital for organisations to deliver value to stakeholders, we will continue pursuing the use of new technologies for business optimisation and communication and develop a new business model to help us contribute more efficiently to a healthier and more secure Europe’.   Note to editors See Alexis’ Goosdeel’s profile at www.emcdda.europa.eu/about/director The EMCDDA Director is the legal representative of the agency and is accountable to the Management Board, the agency’s main decision-making body. Appointed for a renewable five-year period, the Director is responsible for the day-to-day running of the agency (work programmes, budget and staff). The EMCDDA provides the EU and its Member States with ‘factual, objective, reliable and comparable information at European level concerning drugs and drug addiction and their consequences’. Formally established in 1993, it has been operational since 1995. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/4/emcdda-management-board-renews-mandate-of-alexis-goosdeel_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0075	2020-06-23	UNK	COVID-19: New EMCDDA study highlights decline in stimulant drug use but some rises in the use of cannabis, alcohol and prescription medicines to combat anxiety and depression	 A decline in stimulant drug use but some rises in the consumption of cannabis and licit substances are among the findings presented today in a new EMCDDA report The impact of COVID-19 on patterns of drug use and drug-related harms in Europe. The report describes how national confinement measures and disrupted street drug markets have reduced both the opportunities to use drugs within social environments as well as the availability of some substances. But it also suggests a rise in the use of alcohol and prescription medicines, in some groups, as a means of conquering anxiety and depression during lockdown. The report is the second in a series of briefings resulting from an EMCDDA ‘trendspotter’ study, launched in April to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the drug situation and responses to it (1). The findings released today stem from the second wave of the investigation, which focused on drug use patterns and drug-related harms during the first three months of the pandemic. The analysis draws on a range of sources, including: expert surveys, virtual consultations with professionals and NGOs and a recent ‘European Web Survey on Drugs: COVID-19’ (EWSD-COVID), which received over 10 000 responses. Survey responses from people who use drugs and evidence from national experts indicate that stimulants associated with the nightlife setting (mainly cocaine and MDMA) saw the sharpest reduction in use during this period. This is largely due to the closure of the night-time economy and orders to ‘stay at home’ (rather than to market factors). A few cases have been reported of physical socialising being replaced by ‘streaming parties’ — where people use drugs at home, listen to music and meet friends online. However, illegal raves are reported to have taken place in a number of countries. For cannabis, the picture is mixed, with data suggesting that occasional users may have stopped or decreased their use during lockdown, while frequent users may have stocked up and consumed more. Shortages of heroin in some localities may have contributed to a decline in use of this drug and potentially resulted in an increase in demand for opioid substitution treatment as well as in the use of replacement substances. While the majority of respondents in the EWSD-COVID reported stable or reduced drug use, a quarter reported increased use, often due to boredom and anxiety. Drinking alcohol alone, and in greater quantities, is reported by some respondents across user groups, as is the increased use of prescription medicines (e.g. benzodiazepines). Among high-risk drug users, motivations for this include managing depression and withdrawal symptoms. A survey of 15 hospital emergency lead clinicians indicated a rise in drug-related acute presentations due to mental health issues and violent harms but a reduction in drug-related hospital emergencies. An area where there is almost no evidence to date, is the level of COVID-19 infection and related health problems among people who use drugs. The report states that: ‘While undoubtedly changes in drug use patterns and new harms have emerged, with the easing of the lockdown measures and the return to a new social reality under COVID-19, it remains uncertain as to whether the identified changes will remain. It will take time and further investigation to ascertain the longer-term and lasting implications of the pandemic and resultant measures on drug-using populations.’ 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/covid-19-new-emcdda-study-highlights-decline-stimulant-drug-use_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0076	2020-06-15	UNK	A year in review: General Report of Activities 2019 published	 New products and services, working in partnership, and support to policy and practice in the fields of health and security are among the features presented in the latest EMCDDA General Report of Activities published today. The report, covering key achievements and governance in 2019, presents the implementation of the agency’s work programme activities over the 12-month period. 2019 was a year in which the agency released 32 scientific and corporate publications, in addition to 30 Country Drug Reports presenting the situation in the EU Member States, Norway and Turkey. EMCDDA staff contributed to some 300 scientific and institutional drug events and over 500 drug professionals were trained at capacity-building activities carried out by the agency (many in cooperation with partners). Two flagship publications, the European Drug Report 2019 and the third edition of the EU Drug Markets Report (produced with Europol), were launched in Brussels by Dimitris Avramopoulos, then European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship. These reports contributed new evidence on the dynamic drug phenomenon and the increasingly innovative EU drug market, estimated to be worth at least EUR 30 billion per annum. At a time when public health concerns are growing, the agency also acted effectively on three of its key priorities: tackling the problem of drug-related deaths, supporting effective harm-reduction interventions and engaging with drug prevention professionals. The European Prevention Curriculum handbook was an important resource published in this context, designed to support specialists working in the drugs field. This was also the first year of operation under the new legislative framework of the EU Early Warning System (EWS) on new psychoactive substances (NPS). Eight risk communications were issued during in 2019 and 53 new psychoactive substances were notified to the EWS, bringing the total number of substances monitored to around 780. Providing timely information to the EU drug policy debate was a transversal priority in 2019 and much effort was invested in analysing and reporting on developments in the evolving cannabis market. These culminated in a new report and a range of analyses, all of which were provided to key stakeholders. Throughout the year, working in partnership was vital for the EMCDDA. Core to the agency’s activities, as always, were its established data providers: the Reitox network of national focal points. Two important EU-funded technical cooperation projects also took off, one for six of the candidate and potential candidate countries to the EU (IPA 7) and the other for 15 of the European Neighbourhood Policy countries (EU4MD). Working with partners also made it possible to organise the Third European Conference on Addictive Behaviours and Dependencies (‘Lisbon Addictions’) which attracted a record 1 300 participants in 2019. Over the 12 months, the EMCDDA received recognition for its work from practitioners in the field, partners and drug policymakers. In 2019, the agency achieved its highest operational and financial performance to date and received a positive fourth external evaluation for the period 2013–18. The latter highlighted the EMCDDA as a true hub of scientific excellence, both in Europe and internationally. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/year-reviewgeneral-report-activities-2019-published_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0077	2020-06-04	UNK	Impact of COVID-19 on the drug situation in Europe — EMCDDA Director presents findings to European Parliament	 Today, EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel presented to the European Parliament the agency’s recent research findings on the impact of COVID-19 on the drug phenomenon in Europe. Speaking via video conference to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), the Director demonstrated how the agency had been ‘taking the pulse’ of the impact of COVID-19 in three areas: drug use, drug services and drug markets. Since March 2020, COVID-19 has put the EMCDDA’s responsiveness to the test, both in terms of business continuity and monitoring the drug phenomenon. The Director described how the agency had acted quickly and proactively to adapt its working methods and production cycles to address new problems and needs. Using an array of methods — including a web survey, ‘trendspotter’ methodology and darknet monitoring — the agency has published a range of new COVID-19 resources exploring the risks faced by people who use drugs, drug market changes and how drug professionals working with this group are adapting on the frontline. The EMCDDA has also launched a COVID-19 webinar series to give a voice to key professionals working in the drugs field. The impact of COVID-19 on drug use in Europe appears to vary according to the substance concerned. The EMCDDA research shows signs of a rise in the use of cannabis during the pandemic (as users stockpiled the drug before lockdown), as well as in the use of alcohol, benzodiazepines and other medicines. In contrast, the findings point to a decline in the demand for drugs commonly used in recreational settings (e.g. cocaine, MDMA), as people stayed at home. Mr Goosdeel paid tribute to healthcare and social workers in drug services who had assisted clients, despite inadequate safety conditions and personal protective equipment. A lesson learnt is that all treatment and harm reduction services should be an integrated part of essential health services and that both drug professionals and clients should have full access to protective equipment, counselling and testing. A recent EMCDDA survey found that COVID-19 had impacted on continuity of care, with a decline in the availability of drug services during the pandemic and in the numbers of those seeking help. But drug services have also adapted and innovated during the fast-changing crisis in ways that could be carried forward into the future. The Director described how telemedicine had been embraced as an alternative to face-to-face counselling during containment and how more flexible treatment modalities had been introduced. He also referred to how harm-reduction services had been swift to adapt, playing a key role in providing frontline support (e.g. providing food, water, hygiene products). Speaking on the effect of COVID-19 on drug markets, Mr Goosdeel explained that organised crime groups have remained ‘active and resilient’ during the pandemic and that continued violence has been noted among suppliers and distributors. A new EMCDDA-Europol analysis reports that disruption to the drug trafficking supply chain is seen mostly at the distribution level, due to social distancing measures within the EU. With street dealing severely affected by restrictions on movement, consumers and dealers are increasingly turning to alternative methods (e.g. use of darknet markets, social media platforms and encrypted communication apps), with cashless payments and fewer face-to-face interactions. However, there is less evidence of disruption at the wholesale importation level: drug trafficking by maritime shipping continues at levels similar to the pre-pandemic period. The report also showed that production of synthetic drugs has continued in Europe, which could lead to increased availability of these drugs as containment measures lift. Negative economic forecasts for national economies in the post-pandemic period raise particular concerns over potential budget cuts for drug services and the impact on drug users. The Director underlined the need to maintain the level of financing and resources for treatment and harm reduction programmes and to integrate prevention and treatment of COVID-19 into intervention models. He also called for sustainable and fair financing for the EMCDDA in order for it to continue its services, inform drug policymaking and contribute to a healthier and more secure Europe. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/impact-of-covid-19-on-the-drug-situation-in-europe-emcdda-director-presents-findings-to-european-parliament_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0078	2020-05-29	UNK	New report provides window onto EU drug market changes during COVID-19	 What effect is COVID-19 having on the largest criminal market in the EU? This question is explored in EU Drug Markets: Impact of COVID-19, a new report out today from the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and Europol (1). The analysis reports higher prices, local shortages and reduced purity for some drugs, while noting continued violence among suppliers and distributors. It also shows how organised crime groups remain active and resilient, by ‘adapting transportation models, trafficking routes and concealment methods’, even during the pandemic. The two EU agencies have joined forces to improve understanding of drug market developments under COVID-19 and their impact on internal security and public health in the EU. The findings are based on opinions collected through a targeted EMCDDA online survey of drug experts in the EU Member States, Europol’s operational intelligence gathering on organised crime and structured monitoring of open source information. According to the report, disruption to the drug trafficking supply chain is seen mostly at the distribution level, due to social distancing measures within the EU. With street dealing severely affected by restrictions on movement, consumers and dealers are increasingly turning to alternative methods, including the use of darknet markets, social media platforms and encrypted communication apps, with cashless payments and fewer face-to-face interactions. But while the logistics may have changed, the movement of bulk quantities of drugs between EU Member States has not ceased, despite border controls, due to the continued commercial transportation of goods across Europe. There is less evidence of disruption at the wholesale importation level. Drug trafficking by maritime shipping continues at levels similar to the pre-pandemic period, although there has been a marked disruption in smuggling by air passenger transport. Cocaine trafficking via maritime shipping containers continues at levels comparable to 2019 and the number of cocaine seizures in some countries has increased. Heroin trafficking appears to continue along many of the known routes (e.g. Balkan route). COVID-19 has exacerbated already ongoing disruption to the cannabis resin supply chain from Morocco into the EU. This, along with stockpiling of herbal cannabis by consumers, has led to some cannabis shortages and rising prices. Localised shortages of heroin have also been reported, which could lead to a switch to alternative substances (e.g. synthetic opioids). While the demand for cannabis and heroin remain largely stable, demand for synthetic drugs used in recreational settings has ‘significantly diminished’, due to the closure of clubs, nightlife settings and music events. Despite this, the production of synthetic drugs has continued. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘COVID-19 is an unparalleled public health emergency and one that has had ramifications across all areas of modern life. This report provides valuable insights into the short-term impact of the pandemic on the EU drug market and will help us prepare for longer-term repercussions. The economic effect of the crisis is likely to make some in our communities more vulnerable to both drug problems and drug market involvement. Furthermore, the growth of online dealing and encrypted communication will place greater strains on law enforcement. In the post-pandemic period, we are likely to see greater volatility, competition and violence associated with the drug trade. By anticipating these developments now, we will be better prepared to respond quickly and effectively to the new challenges we are likely to face.’ Europol Executive Director Catherine De Bolle says: ‘The pandemic has had a major impact on our lives and is slowing down our economy. However, this economic trend has not been seen in international drug trafficking. These illegal markets continue to generate huge profits, including during the pandemic. Seizures of illegal drugs in some EU countries during the first half of 2020 have been higher than in the same months of previous years. More than ever, these findings should motivate us to ensure that any recovery from the pandemic is accompanied by a strong and effective international law enforcement response. We need to establish that drug traffickers do not benefit from the potential social and economic consequences of the current crisis’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/3/new-report-provides-window-eu-drug-market-changes-during-covid-19_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0079	2020-05-28	UNK	New Zealand: referendum on cannabis legalisation to take place in September 2020 	 Following an agreement made in 2017 between the ruling coalition parties in New Zealand, it has been announced that a referendum on legalising the recreational use of cannabis will be held together with the next general election, on 19 September 2020. On 1 May 2020, a draft bill was published alongside the referendum question: ‘Do you support the proposed “Cannabis Legalisation and Control Bill”?’, with a yes/no answer. The stated purpose of the bill is to reduce cannabis-related harm, and it proposes the establishment of home grow and retail supply systems, as well as a ‘Cannabis Regulatory Authority’ to oversee the sector. Under the bill, the minimum age for cannabis possession or purchase is 20 — by comparison, the minimum age for alcohol purchase is 18. A person may cultivate up to two cannabis plants, and the bill permits up to four plants per household. A person would be able to buy up to 14 grams of dried cannabis per day or its specified equivalent (such as 3.5 grams of concentrates), to be consumed in private or on licensed premises. Social sharing of up to 14 grams would be permitted. Use in public would be fined up to NZ$500 (€280), and possession by an under-age person would be punished by a small fine or a health-based response. Selling to an under-age person would be punished by up to 4 years in prison. Sales would be from licensed retailers, whose premises should not externally promote that they sell cannabis. Those selling cannabis to take away would not be allowed to sell tobacco, alcohol or food, while premises licensed for on-site consumption must provide food and non-alcoholic beverages for sale at the venue. Levels of THC would be limited to 15 % in dried cannabis, and THC and CBD content should be clearly labelled. Cannabis edibles, which must not appeal to children, may possibly be permitted for sale later but not at the first stage. Cannabis-infused products, however, could be produced at home. Neither the advertising of products nor online sales would be allowed. There would be an excise tax on retail products based on weight and potency. The bill proposes a limit on annual production; the cap may be adjusted each year and apportioned between different types of growers, including micro-cultivators. No more than 20 % of the annual cultivation cap would be allocated to one licence holder. A special levy would raise money for harm reduction services, including education and treatment programmes. The referendum vote does not bind the new New Zealand government to act. If more than 50 % of voters vote yes, cannabis will not become legal immediately; the government can introduce a bill to Parliament, which may be modified following public consultation. If more than 50 % vote no, the status quo will remain. The government summary of the bill is here >>The bill is available here >>   This content was published in the EMCDDA’s Cannabis drug policy news on 28.05.2020 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/new-zealand-referendum-on-cannabis-legalisation-to-take-place-in-september-2020_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0080	2020-05-20	UNK	Testing for drug-related infectious diseases — a crucial step towards meeting international health goals 	 Testing for drug-related infectious diseases among people who inject drugs (PWID) is crucial if international health targets are to be met. This is among the conclusions of a new EMCDDA report out today: Drug-related infectious diseases in Europe. The update, from the agency’s drug-related infectious disease network, stresses that early diagnosis through testing, and improving links to treatment and care, are crucial steps towards reaching global health goals. Launched during European Testing Week (15–22 May), the report offers an overview of drug-related infectious diseases among PWID in Europe, including the prevalence and incidence of HIV and viral hepatitis. It also tracks progress on health targets and showcases successfully implemented evidence-based interventions. It underlines the need to ramp up prevention and testing and signals that European countries are lagging behind when it comes to treating hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV among PWID. HIV and chronic viral hepatitis are highly prevalent among people who inject drugs, being transmitted through the sharing of injecting equipment, such as needles and syringes. Addressing the needs of this group is critical to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goal of Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3), which calls for ending the AIDS epidemic and combatting viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 (SDG 3.3)(1). Notifications of newly diagnosed HIV infections among PWID fell in most European countries between 2009 and 2018 (see report, Figure 1). In 2018, 996 new HIV diagnoses linked to injecting drug use were reported in the EU, Norway and Turkey, yet, according to the report, over half of these were diagnosed late, suggesting that opportunities for early interventions and better treatment outcomes are being missed. The policy of ‘test and treat’ for HIV — with antiretroviral therapy (ART) starting directly after diagnosis — can save lives and reduce transmission. But the report states that Europe is ‘far from meeting global targets on ART coverage and viral suppression among PWID’, indicating the need for better linkage to care. Viral hepatitis, particularly infection caused by HCV, is highly prevalent among PWID across Europe and several countries report current infection rates of over 40%. Without access to treatment, many will develop chronic infection, which can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. Harm reduction services are often the first point of entry for diagnosis and links to treatment and play an essential role in preventing new or recurring infections. However, the report reveals that EU countries are not achieving WHO 2020 targets for needle and syringe programmes (NSP) and opioid substitution treatment (OST) coverage (2). To date, only one EU Member State (Luxembourg) has reached the target for both NSP and OST coverage (Figure 4). While outbreaks of HIV and bacterial infections among PWID are relatively rare, they continue to be reported in the EU and are a significant cause for concern. The report presents the latest update on local outbreaks of bacterial infections and HIV among this group in Europe, where injecting stimulant drugs may have been an important risk factor (Figure 7). ‘Despite the availability of a treatment to cure hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and therapies to achieve viral suppression of HIV, financial and social barriers still prevent many PWID from accessing treatment’, the report says. The EMCDDA has developed an ‘elimination barometer’ for hepatitis B and C among PWID to help countries monitor progress towards meeting WHO elimination targets. In addition, an EMCDDA harm-reduction initiative on hepatitis C aims to support countries in contributing to its elimination by increasing access to testing and referrals to care through drug services. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘For the past 25 years, we have been monitoring drug-related infectious diseases in Europe and assessing the risks faced by people who inject drugs. This has helped guide evidence-based interventions, reduce transmission and save lives. Diagnosing early through testing and increasing referrals to treatment and care are simple, yet vital, steps to protect this vulnerable group and contribute to a healthier and more secure Europe’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/testing-drug-related-infectious-diseases-crucial-step-towards-meeting-international-health-goals_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0081	2020-05-12	UNK	COVID-19: New EMCDDA study highlights drop in availability of drug services in Europe but increase in innovation 	 As Europe grapples with the unprecedented public health threat posed by COVID-19, how is the outbreak affecting drug users and service providers? In a new study published today — Impact of COVID-19 on drug services and help-seeking in Europe — the EMCDDA reports signs of a drop in the availability of drug services during the pandemic and in the numbers of those seeking help. But the study also provides insight into how services have adapted and innovated during the fast-changing crisis in ways that could be carried forward into the future. The report is the first in a series of briefings resulting from an EMCDDA ‘trendspotter’ study, launched in April to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the drug situation and responses to it. The agency’s trendspotter methodology explores emerging drug-related trends by rapidly collecting and triangulating data from a variety of sources to allow for timely assessments of topics of concern. Due to national emergency restrictions, the method was adapted to suit online investigation and the study designed to be carried out in successive waves (1). The findings released today stem from the first wave of the investigation which focused on drug services. Results highlight that COVID-19 and national lockdowns have led to reduced availability and provision of treatment and harm-reduction services in most European countries. Emerging evidence suggests that, like other healthcare providers, drug services are facing a range of challenges including: staffing shortages; access to personal protective equipment; and managing infected clients and staff vulnerability to infection. Preliminary findings from the study show that drug services are adapting and innovating during COVID-19, with similar characteristics reported across Europe. With face-to-face counselling curtailed during containment, telemedicine by phone or video has been embraced as an alternative across European drug services. Providers of opioid substitution treatment (OST) have also acted rapidly to change the way in which they provide medication (e.g. mobile OST) and respond to new treatment demands (e.g. new induction procedures), while most countries have relaxed regulations on take-home OST for stable patients (e.g. prescribing for larger quantities or longer periods). Harm-reduction services have also been swift to adapt, playing a key role in providing frontline support during the crisis. This includes: increasing outreach work and needle- and syringe-exchange activities; providing shelter management for homeless and marginalised groups; maintaining drug consumption room services (in situ or mobile) and moving some interventions online (e.g. drug checking). The briefing presents a snapshot of how the demand for specialised treatment evolved between January 2020 and March 2020, providing a first insight on the impact of COVID-19 on help-seeking behaviour. Data show that there was some drop in demand for treatment services during this period for reasons including closure or restricted access to treatment centres and clients’ inability to reach centres due to confinement measures. But this was partially compensated by remote technology and modified interventions. When questioned on the ‘new normal’ for drug services in Europe post-COVID-19, many of the experts surveyed were in favour of maintaining some of the service changes rapidly introduced in recent months. The use of telemedicine was the most cited example, being seen as a useful complement to face-to-face services in the future. Coordination between public, private and non-governmental actors during the crisis was also welcomed by respondents and seen as particularly beneficial for services users. As confinement procedures are eased, drug services will be expected to maintain a broad range of health protection measures, adapt their routines and reinforce contingency planning in case of a second wave. Negative economic forecasts for national economies raise particular concerns over potential budget cuts for drug services and greater marginalisation of certain social groups. Nevertheless, many survey respondents remained hopeful that the innovation and collaboration seen in recent months would remain positive features of drug services in Europe in the foreseeable future. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/new-emcdda-study-highlights-drop-in-availability-of-drug-services-in-europe-but-increase-in-innovation_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0082	2020-05-05	UNK	Increase in darknet market activity for cannabis as users stock up for lockdown	 The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted on our daily lives, including our behaviour as consumers. Just as we have seen online shopping for other goods increase during lockdowns, will we see a similar shift when it comes to illicit drugs? In a special report out today, Drug supply via darknet markets, the EMCDDA explores whether established methods of drug supply and distribution to consumers have changed during recent restrictions on movement. The report analyses activity on three darknet markets (Agartha, Cannazon and Versus) in the first three months of 2020. As the situation is evolving rapidly, the review does not provide a comprehensive overview of the topic but rather preliminary evidence and a snapshot of developments to date. The three markets were chosen for their size, significance for the EU drug market and the fact that they could be accessed for useable data on buyers’ feedback. Over 50 000 reviews from across the three markets were accessed. Qualitative information from a number of online forums was also analysed to further inform the analysis (over 850 posts accessed). The report reveals that, in the darknet markets analysed over the three-month period, the COVID-19 pandemic and the response to it appear to have resulted in an increase in activity levels, mainly related to cannabis products. ‘The cannabis market is a large one and many regular cannabis users may have decided to stock up, anticipating market disruption during the lockdown period’, states the report. ‘To some extent, this is observed in the data where an increase in online trade via darknet markets, driven largely by cannabis products, can be seen in February and March’. In contrast to cannabis, the report shows that there appears to be a decline in the demand for synthetic drugs commonly used in recreational settings (e.g. MDMA) as people stay at home. In the markets analysed, drug sales appear to originate primarily from the United Kingdom and Germany, however, the Netherlands is frequently cited as a source of some of the drugs on offer. The data on cannabis show that, on the one hand, those buying volumes of cannabis for physical resale have reduced their activity, anticipating that resale may be more difficult due to social distancing measures. At the same time, established or new buyers seeking cannabis for personal use are increasing their activity on the market. This may explain the rising number of cannabis sales over time but diminishing revenues. Cannazon, a market devoted to cannabis products, sold an estimated EUR 4.3 million worth of products over the three months, representing 1.6 metric tonnes. Vendors have reacted in different ways. Some appear to be trying to maintain consumer confidence by informing buyers that they are operating in ‘business as usual’ mode. Others have reacted to reduced demand for some drugs by trying to stimulate sales using marketing techniques (e.g. discounts). Another group have opted to suspend their activities or explain to their buyers that they can expect some disruption. A shift towards online drug supply could result in greater use of social media, secure messaging apps and darknet markets. Referrals to encrypted messenger services already appear to be growing. ‘If vendors and buyers switch to this type of technology, activities will not be visible through current darknet monitoring and interdiction will be more challenging,’ concludes the report. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/increase-in-darknet-market-activity-for-cannabis-as-users-stock-up-for-lockdown_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0083	2020-04-30	UNK	EMCDDA preparedness and response to a fast-moving drugs problem	 Revolutionary changes, both in the extent and nature of the drugs problem, and in the world in which we live, have called for constant reflection, innovation and agility to keep pace with new developments and rethink existing routines. This is why the EMCDDA has adopted a multi-indicator approach to monitoring in its response to a fast-moving drugs problem. This month, to mark the EMCDDA’s 25 years of monitoring milestone, we look at how the agency has strengthened and expanded its monitoring tools, on the premise that no single measure can provide a full picture of the drug situation. By complementing data routinely submitted by Member States with information from an expanding range of leading-edge sources (see Figure), the agency can now respond with more timely and rounded analyses to inform drug policies and practice in the years to come. From early-warnings and public health alerts on new drugs, to risk assessments of drug-related infectious disease outbreaks or drug market threats, these innovative methods boost the agency’s preparedness and response. Analyses of data from wastewater studies, hospital emergency departments, web surveys and drug-checking services enhance understanding of drug use and markets in Europe and can provide valuable information for local interventions. The monitoring of darknet markets and open source information may also help identify emerging trends and threats, while trendspotter studies bring together multiple sources for rapid assessments of topics of concern. While these methods have their limitations, they can improve awareness of patterns of drug use and sub-populations of users that are less well-observed. Over the past month, COVID-19 has put the EMCDDA’s responsiveness to the test, both in terms of business continuity and monitoring the drug phenomenon in unprecedented times. Using an array of methods — including a web survey and darknet monitoring — the agency has acted quickly and proactively to publish a range of new resources exploring the risks faced by people who use drugs, drug market changes and how drug professionals working with this group may need to adapt on the frontline. The EMCDDA will continue to monitor and report on the evolving pandemic. A joined-up response, involving a broad range of monitoring tools, will help contribute to a healthier and more secure Europe. Figure: EMCDDA preparedness and response Over the past quarter of a century, the EMCDDA has expanded its monitoring capability to keep pace with revolutionary changes in the extent and nature of the drugs problem and in the world in which we live. By complementing data routinely submitted by Member States with information from an expanding range of leading-edge sources shown below, the agency can now respond with more timely and rounded analyses to inform drug policies and practice in the years to come. EU Early Warning System (1997): A mechanism for the rapid detection and exchange of information on new psychoactive substances (NPS), preceding and informing risk assessments and responses to the health and social threats of these drugs. Public health alerts (2004): Risk communications issued by the EMCDDA to the EU Early Warning System network as alerts on NPS. These help with preparedness planning and response activities at national and EU level. Internet snapshots (2006): Rapid assessments of the marketing and online availability of NPS to users, undertaken during a limited time window. This pioneering method (now discontinued) allowed for repeated cross-sectional samples, highlighting emerging trends. Wastewater analysis (2007): A scientific discipline used to provide almost real-time, population-level data on illicit drug use in Europe. It offers valuable insights into drug use and behavioural changes in key cities, geographically and over time. Trendspotter methodology (2011): A methodology used to explore emerging trends, new patterns of use and drug market changes. It involves rapidly collecting and triangulating data from a variety of sources. Risk assessments on outbreaks of infectious diseases (2011): Joint ECDC–EMCDDA risk assessments involving drug-related infectious disease experts. These help countries affected by, or at risk of, outbreaks to improve their prevention capacity and reduce incidence. Hospital emergency data analysis (2013): Analysis of data from emergency departments in a network of sentinel hospitals in cities across Europe. This provides unique insights into drug-related toxicity, acute health harms and new patterns of use and helps pinpoint sub-populations of drug users. Threat assessments (2014): Exercises to assess emerging drug-related health and security threats to inform and support decision-making at national and European level. They can take the form of reports or briefings (but are not always publicly available). Darknet monitoring (2016): The monitoring of drug-related activity on darknet markets (‘cryptomarkets’). This explores how they function, the threats they pose to health and security and the implications they have for drug control policies and law enforcement activities. Web surveys (2016): Tools which can collect information quickly and cheaply on topics currently not covered by routine methods, such as general population surveys. The European Web Survey on Drugs aims to improve understanding of patterns of drug use and drug market changes in Europe. Cannabis policy alerts (2016): An electronic alert service offering objective information on cannabis policy developments, such as major policy decisions or key reports. Open source information monitoring (2016): The monitoring of information from publicly available sources to reinforce existing knowledge and fill information gaps. The EMCDDA has used OSI to monitor health threats from NPS, complement data on drug markets and keep track of international changes in cannabis policy. Syringe residue studies (2017): An approach which gathers information on the substances used by people who inject drugs, by chemically analysing the residual content of used syringes. It provides local and timely information that can be used for city-level monitoring and intervention. Drug-checking services data analysis (2018): Analysis of data from drug-checking services across Europe. This provides valuable insights into drug market dynamics at user level and can warn users of dangerous substances on the market. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/emcdda-preparedness-and-response-fast-moving-drugs-problem_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0084	2020-04-23	UNK	European Drugs Summer School 2020 to switch to remote teaching	 The European Drugs Summer School (EDSS) will switch to remote teaching this year in an effort to help curb the spread of COVID-19 and reduce pressure on health services. The 2020 EDSS — organised by the EMCDDA and the University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL) — will run from 29 June to 10 July. Under the general theme ‘Illicit drugs in Europe: demand, supply and public policies’, the 2020 course will provide a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of the drugs problem in Europe and beyond. The focus this year will be on hepatitis C. EMCDDA scientific experts, leading academics, guest speakers, policymakers and professionals will prepare students to meet the complex policy challenges in the drugs field. Live afternoon sessions with experts and practitioners will be broadcast during the 10-day course. These sessions will also be recorded and available for subsequent offline viewing. The organisers will set small individual exercises every day and an exam will be offered to those who wish to earn credits. The revised programme will be published at the end of April. Students already registered will be contacted by ISCTE for further information. Please visit the EDSS website for an announcement on fee reductions and the option to defer registration to next year. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/european-drugs-summer-school-2020-to-switch-to-remote-teaching_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0085	2020-04-16	UNK	EMCDDA launches COVID-19 special round of European Web Survey on Drugs to assess impact of pandemic	 Crucial information on the impact of COVID-19 on people who use drugs, and on the services that support them, will be collected via a special round of the European Web Survey on Drugs, launched this week. The survey — the Mini European Web Survey on Drugs: COVID-19 — is coordinated by the EMCDDA in collaboration with its Reitox network of national focal points. The new survey, already available in 18 languages (1), will gather information on how patterns of drug use, access to health services and the drug market may have changed in Europe during the pandemic. This, in turn, will feed into a monthly EMCDDA trendspotter bulletin and a new repository of resources on COVID-19, launched in March on the agency’s website.   The survey findings will contribute to the emerging knowledge base on COVID-19 and Europe’s response to it, potentially helping to protect the health of people who use drugs, improve drug services and raise awareness of market changes.   First piloted as a project in 2016 (2), the European Web Survey on Drugs is one of the EMCDDA’s targeted ‘leading-edge’ monitoring methods, designed to improve understanding of patterns of drug use at European level (see Figure). The aim of the project was to test a web survey tool that could collect information quickly and cheaply on topics currently not covered by routine data collection.    Targeted at people aged over 18 who have used drugs, the new questionnaire is structured in modules on: socio-demographics; COVID-19 status; drug using patterns (last 30 days, last year); access to services and drug market activity (e.g. changes in the way illicit drugs have been obtained during COVID-19). The voluntary and anonymous survey is currently being promoted at national level by the participating Reitox national focal points, supported by other national partners. A special focus is given to promoting the survey through targeted social media advertisements. While web surveys are not representative of the general population, when carefully conducted and combined with traditional data-collection methods, they can help paint a more comprehensive, realistic and timely picture of drug use and drug markets in Europe. As such they are a key ingredient in the EMCDDA’s responsiveness to an ever-shifting drug problem.    The Mini European Web Survey on Drugs: COVID-19 is accessible here:https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/Mini-EWSD-COVID-19 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/emcdda-launches-covid-19-special-round-european-web-survey-drugs-assess-impact-pandemic_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0086	2020-03-30	UNK	25 years of monitoring — selected events from the EMCDDA’s international cooperation history	 Drugs have long been a cross-border phenomenon. As drug problems in Europe are increasingly linked to, and influenced by, global developments, it is crucial that our analysis of trends and developments be placed in the wider international context. This is why working with external partners is a key area of our work, increasing our understanding of the external dimension of the drug phenomenon as well as boosting our preparedness to react quickly to new threats. Over the last 25 years, the EMCDDA has forged a variety of partnerships with a wide range of international organisations, EU agencies and third countries (non-EMCDDA members) (1). These activities are currently guided by the EMCDDA International Cooperation Framework, which charts the direction of work in this area for the period 2018–25, and by the EMCDDA Strategy 2025, which identifies partnerships as one of the agency’s main business drivers. This month, to mark the EMCDDA’s 25 years of monitoring celebration, we have published a commemorative timeline of selected events in our international cooperation history. Take a walk through some of the key moments and milestones. International Cooperation Framework The EMCDDA International Cooperation Framework sets out three strategic objectives: Better assess the global drug situation, including the key drug policy developments occurring internationally. Improve knowledge of EMCDDA stakeholders regarding the drug situation in third countries, in particular in those bordering the EU, to understand the implications for public health in the EU and its impact on the European drug market. Support EU policies and initiatives in the drug field. The framework focuses on three main areas: international organisations, EU agencies and third countries (non-EMCDDA members). International organisations The EMCDDA collaborates with a wide range of international organisations in the areas of public health and security. These include the: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC); Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe; Interpol; World Customs Organization (WCO); World Health Organization; Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) and European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD). Purpose of cooperation: Develop a better understanding of the changing drug phenomenon worldwide and its impact on the European drug situation and market. Strengthen the agency’s role as key player on the international stage and in defining global drug-monitoring systems and standards. Nature of cooperation: Formal memoranda of understanding, cooperation agreements/frameworks and practical joint work programmes. Close participation in routine EMCDDA data-collection activities. Exchange of information, methodologies and expertise (e.g. ad hoc technical collaboration on specific supra-national projects). Read more in our international partners section >> EU agencies The EMCDDA collaborates with several EU agencies in the areas of health and security. In the health domain, it cooperates with: ECDC, ECHA, EFSA, EMA and CHAFEA. In the area of security, it is actively involved in the EU Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) agencies’ network, which aims to coordinate and plan joint activities in the area of migration and security. This network is composed of nine agencies: CEPOL, EASO, EIGE, EMCDDA, eu-LISA, Eurojust, Europol, FRA and Frontex. The EMCDDA chaired the network in 2017. The EMCDDA recently signed working arrangements with five EU agencies under new legislation to respond to public health and social threats caused by new psychoactive substances. Purpose of cooperation: Deliver added value via working together and building synergies. Coordinate and facilitate work and avoid duplication of effort at EU level. Provide the European Commission with a holistic analysis of complex and interlinked issues in specific areas. Nature of cooperation: Formal memoranda of understanding, cooperation agreements and working arrangements and practical joint work programmes. Exchange of best practice, information, methodologies and expertise. Read more in our EU agencies section >> Third countries The EMCDDA has a long tradition of working with third countries (non-EMCDDA countries), which it does by engaging actively in EU-funded regional programmes that provide technical assistance (e.g. to prepare for accession) or by cooperating in the framework of bilateral working arrangements. Third country groups: Candidate countries — currently Albania, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia — and potential candidates — Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo*. Eastern and southern neighbours — Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Moldova, Morocco, Palestine**, Syria (suspended in 2011), Tunisia, Ukraine. Other third countries — Canada, Russian Federation, Switzerland, United Kingdom, USA (if in the interest of the EU and subject to bilateral working arrangements and the availability of EU-funded projects at regional level). Purpose of cooperation: Prepare the candidate countries and potential candidates for future accession to the EU. Allow the EMCDDA to improve its knowledge on the drug situation in third countries (particularly those bordering the EU). Understand better the public health and security implications and threats for the EU. Share knowledge on drug monitoring among the EMCDDA’s key external partners. Promote the EU’s balanced and integrated approach to the drug phenomenon. Nature of cooperation: Formal memoranda of understanding, working arrangements, joint statements, friendship declarations, ad hoc agreements and practical joint work programmes. Exchange of best practice, information, methodologies and expertise. EU-funded projects (see below). EU-funded projects: Instrument of Pre-accession Assistance 7 project (IPA 7), financed by the Instrument of Pre-accession (IPA). EU4Monitoring Drugs (EU4MD) project, financed through the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI). Ad hoc scientific support to the: Central Asia Drug Action Programme (CADAP); Cooperation Programme between Latin America, the Caribbean and the European Union on Drugs Policies (COPOLAD); EU Action against Drugs and Organised Crime (EU-ACT) project; and the Cocaine route programme.

EMCDDA_UNK_0087	2020-03-25	UNK	EMCDDA publishes update on the implications of COVID-19 for people who use drugs and for drug service providers 	 What specific risks are people who use drugs (PWUD) likely to face during the COVID-19 pandemic? What services will they need? How will professionals working with this group need to adapt on the frontline? These are among the questions raised in a new EMCDDA update published today. The update is the work of an EMCDDA taskforce of experts and reviewers, set up by Director Alexis Goosdeel. Its aim was to assess the emerging COVID-19 risks for this population and, where necessary, to encourage the planning, review and adaptation of frontline and specialist drug interventions. The Director also invited audiences via social media to post or submit questions, testimonies and experiences on the perceived risks for PWUDs, the associated challenges for healthcare systems and solutions found COVID19_PWUD@emcdda.europa.eu). The EMCDDA recognises that services working with PWUD are faced with the same challenges as other health and care providers to ensure continuity of care, whilst adapting their working practices to reflect international and national guidelines on reducing COVID-19 infection risks and promoting good hygiene practices. However, some additional considerations also need to be highlighted that are important for reducing risks and responding to the needs of this population. People who use drugs, particularly Europe’s ageing cohort of opioid users, may be particularly vulnerable to poor outcomes linked to pre-existing health problems and lifestyle factors. Some drug use behaviours, as well as poor socio-economic conditions and marginalisation, may also pose additional risks that are important to take into account. The EMCDDA notes in the update that some of the underlying chronic medical conditions experienced by some PWUD could increase the risk of developing severe illness, if infected with COVID-19. It also highlights the potentially greater risk of opioid-related deaths (if aggravated by breathing difficulties caused by COVID-19) and the prospect of problems linked to sharing drug using equipment (for inhalation, vaping, smoking or injecting). According to the update, the type of settings used by PWUD may put them at an increased risk of exposure to COVID-19. It underlines the importance of prevention measures in settings frequented by PWUD (e.g. drug services, homeless shelters and prisons) and the need for protocols to respond to PWUD who show signs of COVID-19 infection. ‘It will be crucial to guarantee the continuity of core health services to drug users’, adds the paper. ‘In this context, it is vital to ensure that services are properly resourced, staff protection measures are in place and service planning is prioritised. Drug treatment services and low-threshold harm reduction services for PWUD are essential health services, which will need to stay in operation under restricted conditions’. It goes on to state that: ‘Ensuring the ongoing provision of drug treatment services, including opioid substitution medications and other essential medicines to clients, will therefore be a paramount consideration. Contingency plans will be needed for potential medication and equipment shortages’. Finally, COVID-19 and related restrictions on movement in some localities may lead to the disruption of drug markets and a reduced supply of illicit drugs. This could have a range of repercussions, especially for dependent drug users and could potentially result in an increased demand for drug services. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/emcdda-publishes-update-on-the-implications-of-COVID-19-for-people-who-use-drugs-and-for-drug-service-providers_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0088	2020-03-23	UNK	EMCDDA offers its sympathies to earthquake-struck Croatia	 A large earthquake rocked Croatian capital Zagreb on 22 March, increasing the strain on the country’s emergency services, which are already challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic. The EMCDDA offers its solidarity to Croatia, in particular to the country’s Reitox national focal point (hosted by the Institute of Public Health) and to Ombudswoman Lora Vidović, whose offices were damaged in the disaster. The agency fully supports the country in its current six-month Presidency of the Council of the EU.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/emcdda-offers-its-sympathies-earthquake-struck-croatia_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0089	2020-03-16	UNK	New COVID-19 precautionary measures: EMCDDA to switch to teleworking from 16 March 2020	 EMCDDA staff members will be switching to teleworking today following a decision by its Director Alexis Goosdeel (1). The decision comes as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to intensify and as the EU and its Member States adopt new precautionary measures. In a statement informing employees on Friday (13 March), the Director stressed: ‘As of today, there have been no recorded cases of COVID-19 contamination at the agency. The decision to switch to teleworking has been taken to strengthen efforts to protect EMCDDA staff and their families. But it has also been taken in the spirit of our common responsibility to help flatten the curve of infection and ease the pressure on national healthcare systems’. Goosdeel added: ‘This is a very unusual moment, both for the EMCDDA and for the EU and its citizens, and we will only be able to cope with the current situation by remaining united and solidary’. The decision is the latest in a number of proactive contingency measures taken by management since late February to minimise the risk of infection, including: the postponement of meetings throughout March; the cancellation of work trips; limited access to the premises and the quarantining of a small number of staff members due to recent travel history (these quarantines have now ended without incident). The agency is also reaching out on social media to find out more about coronavirus risks specifically for people with substance use disorders. From the beginning of the outbreak, the EMCDDA has taken action in line with the scientific evidence published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Portuguese health authorities and its own medical adviser. The new decision will mean that staff members will telework for two weeks from today, although the period may be suspended or extended depending on the evolution of the situation. While staff will not be in quarantine, they will be advised to observe the recommended social distancing and hygiene protocols. In preparation for the shift, staff members were trained last week in the technical skills required for an extended teleworking period and advised on how to adapt work methods and procedures in the current circumstances. The EMCDDA activated its business continuity plan at midnight on Friday 13 March to switch to remote working. In response to the pandemic, President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen also informed staff on 12 March that the Commission had activated a business continuity plan requiring staff in non-critical functions to telework from 16 March.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/new-covid-19-precautionary-measures-emcdda-switch-teleworking-16-march-2020_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0090	2020-03-12	UNK	Latest wastewater data reveal drug-taking habits in 68 European cities  — traces of stimulant drugs rise again   	 The latest findings from the largest European project in the emerging science of wastewater analysis are presented today by the Europe-wide SCORE group, in association with the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) (1). The project analysed wastewater in 68 cities in 23 European countries to explore the drug-taking behaviours of their inhabitants. From Stockholm to Barcelona and Santiago de Compostela to Nicosia, the study analysed daily wastewater samples in the catchment areas of wastewater treatment plants over a one-week period in March 2019. Wastewater from approximately 49 million people was analysed for traces of four illicit stimulant drugs: amphetamine, cocaine, MDMA (ecstasy) and methamphetamine (cannabis and heroin are not included in the study). Compared to previous years, the 2019 study points to an overall rise in the detection of the four drugs studied. Wastewater-based epidemiology is a scientific discipline with the potential for monitoring close to real-time, population-level trends in illicit drug use (see motion graphic for method) (2). By sampling a known source of wastewater, such as a sewage influent to a wastewater treatment plant, scientists can now estimate the quantity of drugs used in a community by measuring the levels of illicit drugs and their excreted metabolites (3). The SCORE group has been conducting annual wastewater monitoring campaigns since 2011. The 2019 results are released today in ‘Wastewater analysis and drugs — a European multi-city study’, an updated edition in the EMCDDA Perspectives on Drugs (POD) series. The POD includes an innovative interactive map and a chart-based tool allowing the user to look at geographical and temporal patterns and to zoom in on results per city and per drug. 2019 findings: what’s new? The 2019 findings offer a valuable snapshot of drug use patterns in the cities involved, revealing marked geographical and temporal variations: MDMA: The 2019 data point to increased residues of MDMA in most cities, which may reflect this drug no longer being a niche or subcultural drug limited to dance clubs and parties, but now being used by a broader range of young people in mainstream nightlife settings. Of the 42 cities with wastewater data for 2018 and 2019, 23 reported an increase. The highest residues of MDMA were found in cities in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. Amphetamine: The most recent data show that most cities reported an increase in amphetamine residues. Of the 41 cities with data for 2018 and 2019, 21 cities reported an increase for amphetamine. The results varied considerably across the study locations, with the highest levels reported in cities in the north and east of Europe. Amphetamine was found at much lower levels in cities in the south of Europe. Cocaine: Of the 45 cities with wastewater data for 2018 and 2019, the latest figures reveal a further increase in cocaine use in 27 of them. Cocaine residues in wastewater were highest in western and southern European cities, particularly in cities in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK. The analysis points to very low levels of cocaine use in the majority of eastern European cities, but the most recent data show here also signs of increases. Methamphetamine: Traditionally concentrated in Czechia and Slovakia, methamphetamine now appears to be present in Cyprus, the east of Germany, Spain and several northern European countries (e.g. Denmark, Lithuania, Finland and Norway). Of the 42 cities with wastewater data on methamphetamine for 2018 and 2019, 17 cities reported an increase. However, in contrast to the other three drugs, methamphetamine residues were very low to negligible in most locations. Weekly patterns: More than three-quarters of cities showed higher residues of cocaine and MDMA in wastewater during the weekend (Friday to Monday) than during weekdays, reflecting the predominantly recreational use of these substances, now seen in a range of social settings. For amphetamine, half of cities show higher residues in wastewater during the weekend than during weekdays, possibly indicating more use in recreational settings than in the past. In contrast, methamphetamine was found to be distributed more evenly over the whole week, possibly reflecting this drug being associated with more on-going and high-risk consumption by a small cohort of users. City variations: The study highlighted differences between the cities within the same country. This may be partly explained by the different social and demographic characteristics of the cities concerned (universities, nightlife areas and age distribution of the population). In the vast majority of countries, with multiple study locations, residues were higher in large cities compared to smaller locations for all four substances. The EMCDDA adopts a multi-indicator approach to drug monitoring on the principle that no single measure can provide a full picture of the drug situation. It views wastewater analysis as a valuable additional tool which can provide timely information on a wide spectrum of substances. Alexis Goosdeel, EMCDDA Director says: ‘Wastewater analysis has demonstrated its utility over the last decade as an important new drug monitoring tool and a complement to more established monitoring methods. By delivering almost real-time data on drug use patterns, both geographically and over time, this novel approach can offer a valuable snapshot of drug use in key cities in Europe and an insight into emerging changes in behaviour. It is also showing promise in new areas, such as identifying, and estimating the use of, new psychoactive substances and assessing the outcome of interventions targeting drug supply. As a method, wastewater analysis has moved from being an experimental technique to being an important addition in our epidemiological toolkit’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/1/latest-wastewater-data-reveal-drug-taking-habits-in-68-european-cities_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0091	2020-02-07	UNK	News from EU4Monitoring Drugs, an EMCDDA technical cooperation project	 This content was published in the third EU4MD update released on 07.02.2020. This update also presents a section on partnerships and related activities, upcoming events, and a research corner. Focus on new methods for drug monitoring In recent years the EMCDDA has developed collaborative work with several European research groups to explore new tools and methods for monitoring drug use and related risks in the general population and among specific populations. To share these experiences and discuss the relevance of new methods for the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) countries, a workshop was organised with the partners on the occasion of the 8th extended Reitox network meeting in Lisbon in November 2019. Eight countries attending the workshop discussed whether and how these methods could be implemented in their countries. Wastewater analysis (SCORE network) Assessing illicit drugs in wastewater is a new approach to estimate drug use in populations, based on the detection and quantification of drugs and their metabolic products in community wastewater. Wastewater analysis allows for the better identification of the drugs being used and can provide near-real-time results; it has the potential to identify trends in drug use patterns, over time and geographically. Syringe residue analysis (ESCAPE network) A group of European researchers has developed an innovative method to obtain information on injected substances by chemically analysing the residual content of used syringes. This method, applied by the ESCAPE (European Syringe Collection and Analysis Project Enterprise) network, provides timely and local information that complements existing data on substances injected by users. Hospital emergencies (Euro-DEN network) Hospital emergency data can provide a unique insight into acute health harms related to drug use. The European Drug Emergencies Network (Euro-DEN) was established in October 2013 with the aim of improving knowledge at the European level on acute toxicity from established illicit/recreational drugs and new psychoactive substances (NPS). There are currently 32 active Euro-DEN Plus sentinel centres, collecting data in 22 countries. The Euro-DEN group developed a minimum dataset to capture the key demographic, clinical and outcome variables in presentations with acute drug toxicity to emergency departments. Active recruitment of centres continues in 2020. Interview with Ketevan Sarajishvili, Secretary of the Inter-Agency Coordinating Council for Combating Drug Abuse What are the main drug-related challenges facing Georgia? The first main challenge for the Georgian authorities is the Darknet. Taking into account the emerging character of the drugs phenomenon, online drug trade seems challenging for Georgia, just like for the European countries and the whole international community. The second challenge relates to statistics and data analysis because there is a lack of accurate and consolidated statistics, surveys and data analysis systems. Different stakeholders, including the governmental and non-governmental sector and academia, are collecting some data and conducting research studies, however, this does not create a clear and comprehensive picture of the drugs situation in Georgia. A drug monitoring system and well-functioning observatory, which would assess the situation from the perspective of demand/supply and harm reduction, constitute the best institutional guarantee for the development of evidence-based drug policy in Georgia.  Finally, the third main challenge is prevention. Holistic and well-coordinated prevention is an important tool to address drug issues, to avoid substance misuse among children, adolescents and the general population. While the international community agrees that prevention should enhance protective factors and reduce risk factors, the state needs an entire strategy in order to ensure mutually agreed, synergic, and consistent anti-drug actions. It is worth mentioning that prevention is an integral priority of the National Strategy on Combating Drug Abuse in Georgia, however, we feel there is a lack of a complex proactive approach and coordinated preventive initiatives among governmental and non-governmental agencies. What are the current health and security threats related to drugs? The online access to new psychoactive substances (NPS) constitutes a growing and potential health and security threat. Apart from this, the geographical location of Georgia could also be the subject of security considerations, since drug trafficking is one of the forms of organised crime that has a transnational character.  What has been done to address the challenges posed by drugs? Georgian authorities acknowledge the challenges identified and have developed comprehensive measures to address them. In particular, the Central Criminal Police Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) established a specialised Division for fighting with online dealing and postal distribution of drugs and NPSs. The division is staffed with law enforcement officers with relevant qualifications and skills.  As a result, 38 people were arrested for online drug dealing in 2019 and 15 drug-related online shops (through which drugs were traded) were closed. When it comes to data collection and analysis, Georgia prioritises the importance of developing evidence-based drug policy. For that aim, the March 2018 Interagency Anti-Drug Coordinating Council decided to create the national drug observatory, which was established upon the Order of the Minister of Justice of Georgia on 16 January 2020. The National Drug Monitoring Centre is made up of experts on prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, harm-reduction, supply reduction, addictology, sociology, epidemiology and representatives from state agencies. It is the institutional guarantee for the dissemination of scientifically valid information on drugs and drug dependence issues. Apart from this, the independent and objective evidence based on solid surveys and research studies prepared by the Centre will assist policymakers to trust reliable information and implement evidence-based drug policy. As for prevention, the Inter-Agency Coordinating Council for Combating Drug Abuse, which is chaired by the Justice Minister with the assistance of national and international experts, is elaborating the Georgian National Strategy for Drug Misuse Prevention. This will be relevant to the Georgian context and promote coordinated, comprehensive and result-oriented drug prevention activities.  Where and how can the EU4MD project make a difference? The Georgian authorities closely cooperate with the EMCDDA within the framework of the Memorandum of Understanding signed 4 November 2015 between the Ministry of Justice and the EMCDDA. Taking into consideration the fact that Georgia has already established the national drug observatory, capacity-building activities and experience-sharing from the EMCDDA are highly appreciated. The EMCDDA has sustainable and consistent experience and expertise in evaluation and monitoring tools and its support will enhance the proficiency and knowledge of the Georgian drug observatory. Assistance from the EMCDDA in order to increase the response capacity to Darknet issues will also help strengthen the Georgian law enforcement institutions. Interview with Rim Mansouri, Pharmacist Inspector General, Director of the Permanent Secretariat of the National Narcotics Office What are the main drug-related challenges facing? In Tunisia, we have a limited number of studies and data on drug use, therefore we may lack information to assess accurately the issue, which is felt by health professionals as very important and evolving, especially because the increase of the availability of these products. The National Bureau of Narcotics, under the chairmanship of the Ministry of Health, is the guardian of the United Nations international conventions on Drugs. The bureau coordinates the drug-related activities in different ministries, namely health, justice, interior, customs, education, higher education, social affairs, women and families, youth and sport. What are our main challenges? We would like to establish a ‘Tunisian Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Addiction’ which would collect drug-related data and information from the various ministries involved in the field of drugs with the aim to produce annual reports that support the planning and implementation of our national drug policies. We would also like to develop a drug information network, where we know what sources of information there are, how they operate, and who are the focal points. It would be important to train them on how to collect data and information. Finally, we would like to introduce opioid agonist therapy with methadone. We have around 33 000 people who inject opioids, but at the moment there is no specialised treatment centre that would provide medical care for them.  What are the current health and security threats related to drugs? Drugs remain a challenge for the health, safety and well-being of citizens in Tunisia. What we observe is a shift in lifestyles and behaviour, particularly among adolescents. We also see that the majority of people affected with HIV/AIDS are young, between 25 and 39. New psychoactive substances are another issue: they are mainly unknown to professionals in the health and safety sectors and they are increasingly available in the consumer market. Finally, a lack of specialised care services for people who inject drugs is an issue, especially when we speak about care needed to address hepatitis, HIV and other health problems. What has been done to address the challenges posed by drugs? First I would like to mention a new law on narcotics, which reduces the punitive aspect. The reformed law removes automatic prison sentences for drug use and the possession of drugs for personal use, and gives judges the possibility of applying mitigating circumstances, thus enhancing the state’s commitment to care and prevention in drug use. The National Health Institute has agreed with the Minister of Health and the National Bureau of Narcotics a proposal for the implementation of a data collection network. In March 2019, after refurbishment, we opened a new rehabilitation and treatment centre for people who use drugs. There are several on-going projects, funded through the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and to establish additional care centres in Tunisia. Where and how can the EU4MD project make a difference? We are thankful for the support so far from the EMCDDA and are committed to continue cooperation within the EU4Monitoring Drugs project. Our wish is that the project would further increase the capacities of our health and law enforcement professionals. We welcome training sessions and exchanges on data collection, innovative methods for drug trafficking, updates on control of precursors and implementation of opioid agonist treatment. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/update-eu4monitoring-drugs-project-Feb_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0092	2020-02-06	UNK	Bursaries for Western Balkan students for the 2020 European Drugs Summer School 	 Professionals, academics and experts from the Western Balkan region will have an opportunity to participate in the European Drugs Summer School (EDSS) this year, thanks to three bursaries being offered through the EMCDDA Instrument of Pre-accession Assistance 7 project (IPA7), which kicked off in July 2019.

EMCDDA_UNK_0093	2020-01-30	UNK	A quarter of a century providing evidence for better policies and actions on drugs in Europe 	 This year, the EMCDDA celebrates 25 years of monitoring the drug situation in Europe. In the quarter of a century since the agency embarked on its first work programme in 1995, we have seen revolutionary changes, both in the extent and nature of the drugs problem, and in the world in which we live. Keeping pace with an increasingly dynamic drug phenomenon, while remaining relevant to policy and practice, requires constant reflection, innovation and agility. This is why we will be developing a new business model as we pursue our vision to contribute to a healthier and more secure Europe. When the agency first opened in Lisbon, with a staff of 17, the EU of then 15 Member States was in the midst of a major heroin epidemic, with drug policy largely influenced by HIV transmission, AIDS and overdose deaths. Our monitoring at that time centred on a handful of ‘traditional’ illicit drugs — mainly heroin, cannabis and cocaine. Today, Europe’s drug market is far more volatile and complex, driven by globalisation, the internet and rapid changes in technology. As a result, we are also monitoring 780 new psychoactive substances, many of which were unknown when the agency was first established. The creation of the EMCDDA symbolised a major political decision to build drug-related policies on evidence rather than ideology. By improving the comparability of drug data across the EU, we have given countries a ‘common language’ with which to describe the extent and effects of drug use. We can now be proud of our internationally-recognised European drug monitoring system, including early-warning mechanisms to ensure rapid responses to new substances and emerging threats. This has contributed to a deeper and broader understanding of the problem, earning the agency the reputation as the trusted reference point on drugs in Europe. And as we expand our reporting to include data from innovative sources, we will build a better and timelier knowledge base to inform drug policies in the years to come. For the past 25 years, the EMCDDA has provided strategic analysis in a policy area that cuts across health and security. Part of the agency’s unique value is its comprehensive coverage of this multifaceted problem. With our Strategy 2025, we are committed to adding value to the work of EU and national drug policymakers and professionals. This will bring about better informed drug policy and action, in line with the EU balanced approach to reduce drug supply and demand. Our achievements to date would not have been possible without close collaboration with national, European and international partners, particularly the EU institutions, the Reitox network and our host country, Portugal. Working in partnership will continue to be central to our activity, as the European drugs problem becomes increasingly linked to, and influenced by, global developments in the drugs field. Although today’s drugs problem is less visible ‘on the streets’ than it once was, we are confronted with a rapidly growing and violent drug market, which is increasingly global, joined-up and digitally enabled. Availability of highly potent and pure products at lower prices is a cause for increasing concern and represents a clear wake-up call for policymakers. As we celebrate our first 25 years of monitoring and look to the future, I firmly believe that drugs must, once again, receive the attention they deserve. Alexis Goosdeel, EMCDDA Director 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/quarter-century-providing-evidence-better-policies-and-actions-drugs-europe_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0094	2020-01-28	UNK	EMCDDA Director presents EU Drug Markets Report 2019 at European Parliament — ‘a clear wake-up call for policymakers’	 EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel was at the European Parliament today, where he presented the findings of the EMCDDA–Europol EU Drug Markets Report 2019 (EDMR 2019) to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). The Director reiterated that the report, launched on 26 November, is a ‘clear wake-up call’ for policymakers to address the rapidly growing drug market, which is increasingly global, joined-up and digitally enabled. Hyper production of drugs, within and beyond EU borders, has led to high availability of natural and synthetic substances and consumers now have access to a diverse range of highly potent and pure products at affordable prices. He also stressed his mounting concern over the rise in drug-related violence and corruption within the EU. Acting on the far-reaching consequences of the drug market for health and for security must now be an urgent priority. Europeans are spending at least EUR 30 billion on drugs each year at retail level, making the drug market a major source of income for organised crime groups in the European Union. Around two-fifths of this total (39%) is spent on cannabis, 31% on cocaine, 25% on heroin and 5% on amphetamines and MDMA. The Director added that the drugs problem needed to be prioritised in Europe and that there was no time for complacency. ‘Drugs must receive the attention they deserve’, he said. As the European Commission evaluates the 2013–20 EU drugs strategy and action plan (2017–20), the Director underlined the importance of the EU’s balanced approach to the drugs problem, based on the two pillars of drug demand reduction and supply reduction and fully respecting fundamental rights. The EDMR 2019 is the third state-of-the art overview of the European illicit drug market from the EMCDDA and Europol and covers trends along the supply chain from production and trafficking to distribution and sales. It describes how the drug market has wide-ranging impacts on both health and security and how a holistic approach is crucial for effective drug control policies. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/emcdda-director-presents-eu-drug-markets-report-2019-european-parliament-clear-wake-call-policymakers_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0095	2020-01-21	UNK	EMCDDA and CICAD give seal of approval on latest joint work programme activities  	 EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel is in Washington today where he will meet Ambassador Adam Namm, Executive Secretary of the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD). The purpose of the visit is to discuss ongoing EMCDDA–CICAD cooperation and review the topics to be addressed under the joint work programme (2020–2024). Respectively, the two organisations lead the regional drug information systems of Europe and the Americas and, in so doing, make a valuable contribution to evidence-based information on drugs at global level. The EMCDDA collaborates with CICAD under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with its parent body, the Organization of American States (OAS) in 2000. In the context of the MoU, the two bodies hold regular coordination meetings to fine-tune work programme activities and assess progress. This is Mr Goosdeel’s first visit to CICAD since taking up the post of Director in January 2016. Ambassador Lamm visited the EMCDDA in March 2019 to discuss perspectives of the new work programme, which will be formally signed this week. During the visit, the EMCDDA delegation will meet CICAD staff, including: Angela Crowdy, CICAD Assistant Executive Secretary; Farah Urrutia, Secretary for Multidimensional Security; and Marya Hynes, Chief of the Inter-American Observatory on Drugs. Strategic objectives outlined in the work programme include: strengthening regional and international monitoring systems (including early-warning systems on new psychoactive substances/NPS); harmonising and developing indicators in the areas of drug supply and demand; and supporting the establishment of national drug monitoring centres and drug information networks. In the respective geographical areas of the two bodies, the programme also foresees information exchange on regional and national drug strategies, legislation and developments in drug production and use. A significant component of the EMCDDA–CICAD partnership to date has been the publication of a joint handbook on building national drug observatories. Released in 2010 and now available in 10 languages, this practical guide supports the establishment and development of national drug monitoring centres in Europe — including non-EU countries — and Latin America. The meeting is expected to look at the current format of the handbook and potential updates. During the two-day meeting, the Directors will present an overview of their respective organisations’ activities. Roumen Sedefov, EMCDDA Head of unit for Risks to public safety and security, will present the ‘making of’ the 2019 EU Drug Markets Report and the EU early warning system on NPS. Gonçalo Felgueiras, EMCDDA Head of unit for Reitox and external partners — joining the agency’s delegation as its contact point for the implementation of the work programme — will discuss synergies with his counterpart Marya Hynes. The EMCDDA and CICAD support UN and EU efforts to strengthen information systems on drugs. They are two key contributing institutions to the EU’s Cooperation Programme between Latin America, the Caribbean and the European Union on Drugs Policies (COPOLAD). This programme aims to improve the coherence, balance and impact of drug policies between the regions, through the exchange of mutual experience, bi-regional coordination and the promotion of coordinated responses. COPOLAD II, which kicked off in 2015, will draw to a close in June this year and its continuation is currently being discussed at EU level.

EMCDDA_UNK_0096	2020-01-20	UNK	Canada – edible cannabis products may now be sold in Canada	 From 16 December 2019, edible cannabis products are permitted to be sold in Canada. These must comply with new regulations for edible, inhalable and topical products, designed to reduce the risk of accidental consumption or overconsumption. Edible products are not individually approved for sale, but the regulations instruct manufacturers to provide Health Canada with a written notice of the product – including class of product, description and expected date of offering for sale – then wait 60 days before sale, to give the authorities time to raise any concerns. As the new regulations came into force on 17 October 2019, the earliest date for the sale of edible cannabis products was therefore 16 December 2019. Herbal cannabis products and cannabis oils have been on sale in licensed shops in Canada since 17 October 2018. The new regulations introduce three new product classes: edible cannabis for eating or drinking; cannabis extracts for ingesting (which includes absorption in the mouth) or for inhaling; and cannabis topicals (such as creams or ointments), for application to external body surfaces (skin, hair or nails). The existing class of cannabis oils will be deleted by October 2020, and in the future these products will be considered as cannabis extracts. In line with Canada’s objective of legalising for protection of public health, and keeping young people away from the market, the regulations state that products must not be appealing to youth or make health or cosmetic claims, and should not associate with tobacco, vaping or alcohol products. Packaging must be plain and child-resistant, must carry a standardised cannabis symbol and health warning, and be labelled with the THC and CBD content. Package sizes are limited to 10 mg THC per package for edible products and 10 mg THC per capsule or dispensed amount for cannabis extract; in addition there is a limit of 1000 mg THC per package for products other than edibles, e.g. a bottle of capsules. Cannabis extract for ingesting or inhaling should not have added sugars, sweeteners or colours, but this restriction does not apply to edible cannabis for eating or drinking. The new, updated warning messages include one stating that ‘It can take up to 4 hours to feel the full effects from eating or drinking cannabis.’ Regulations and explanatory notes >>   This content was published in the EMCDDA’s Cannabis drug policy news on 20.01.2020 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2020/canada-edible-cannabis-products-may-now-be-sold-in-canada_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0097	2019-12-18	UNK	EMCDDA Best practice portal update	 Pharmacotherapies for the treatment of cocaine use disorders There are signs that increased cocaine availability in Europe is resulting in growing health costs. Since 2014, the number of new clients entering treatment for cocaine problems, although still relatively low, has increased by over 35% in Europe. Yet, evidence available to support what constitutes effective services for cocaine users remains relatively weak, and targeted programmes for cocaine users are currently limited in Europe. Psychosocial interventions remain the most common line of action in the treatment of cocaine use disorders. Some neurostimulation techniques have shown encouraging results, but no decisive evidence, in reducing cocaine craving. In the new round of updates to the Best practice portal we found that antipsychotics are likely to be effective in retaining patients in treatment and some promising but not yet conclusive evidence that psychostimulants may be effective in reducing cocaine use. Evidence summaries are available at the Best practice portal. Brief interventions for cannabis use In the previous round of updates to the Best practice portal, we found insufficient data to conclude that brief interventions (BIs) for cannabis use in post-secondary school settings are either effective or ineffective. Yet, new evidence found that BIs may be effective in improving short-term abstinence and in reducing the risk of cannabis use disorders among young adults. Brief interventions (BIs) are short interventions consisting of one of several sessions, each taking between 5 to 60 minutes, usually conducted individually and in-person. Comorbid bipolar and substance use disorders Mental health problems, such as bipolar disorder (BD) are very common in those with a substance use disorder (SUD); they increase the difficulty of treating SUD and lead to poorer prognoses for both disorders. While there are effective pharmacotherapies for BD and for SUD separately, less in known about treating their comorbidity. A recent systematic review found promising but inconclusive evidence of effectiveness of mood stabilizers in improving treatment outcomes for comorbid BD-SUD. Technology-based interventions for women Technology-based interventions (TBIs) are brief interventions delivered by computer, mobile phones, and other emerging technologies; they may be modelled after the motivational interviewing approach or consist of text messages periodically sent to participants to provide educational information. In the last round of updates to the Best practice portal we found that TBIs are likely to be beneficial in reducing alcohol and illicit drug use among women of childbearing age (18 to 44 years old). Xchange registry — environmental interventions in 2020 Xchange is an online registry of evidence-based prevention programmes. In its first phase, the registry made available manualised interventions for which good European evaluation studies showed beneficial outcomes relating to substance use. Now it also contains programmes for delinquency and violence prevention in youth. From 2020 on, we will gradually be adding non-manualised interventions, starting with local environmental prevention strategies.

EMCDDA_UNK_0100	2019-12-17	UNK	New EMCDDA Scientific Committee appointed for the next three years 	 On 13 December, the EMCDDA Management Board appointed 15 high-level scientists to serve on the agency’s Scientific Committee for the period 2020–22. The selection followed a call for expressions of interest in the Official Journal of the European Union in April this year, which yielded 78 eligible applications. The 15 members — selected from EU Member States, Norway and Turkey — were chosen, following a public selection process, on the basis of scientific merit, independence and expertise in the most relevant scientific fields linked to the problems of drugs and drug addiction today. Almost half of the scientists appointed are new members, while eight previously served on the Committee. As members are appointed in a personal capacity, they are required to give their opinions independently of their country and of the EU institutions. The Scientific Committee plays a major role in the EMCDDA’s endeavour to attain scientific excellence. The agency consults the Committee on the quality of its work programmes and on any scientific matter concerning its activity, which the Management Board or the Director may submit to it. The Management Board also approved a list of experts to be called upon by the EMCDDA Director for the purposes of assessing the risks posed by new psychoactive substances (NPS) — one of the agency’s core tasks. The mandate of the current Committee and risk assessment experts draws to a close at the end of 2019. The EMCDDA would like to thank the outgoing experts for their hard work and their role as guardians and advocates of the scientific integrity of the agency over two consecutive terms (2014–16 and 2017–19). Further details on the new Scientific Committee will be available in January 2020. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/new-emcdda-scientific-committee-appointed-for-next-three-years_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0101	2019-12-06	UNK	SOLIDIFY project: a broad European partnership stands for a local drug  policy based on the principles of harm reduction and supports the  implementation of Supervised Drug Consumption Facilities 	 On 5 and 6 December 2019, 150 participants took part in the final conference of Efus’ SOLIDIFY project, held in Lisbon, Portugal. Co-hosted with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and the Municipality of Lisbon (CML), the event showcased work produced over two years on how to foster local multi-agency partnerships around Supervised Drug Consumption Facilities (SDCFs) in order to capitalise on the positive impacts they can have for urban security and public tranquillity. A hub for intense exchange and discussion The participants – representatives of local, regional and national authorities, civil society organisations, research centres, law enforcement agencies, and initiatives and networks of people who use drugs – discussed a range of key questions relating to the future of European drug policies. These included: How to foster local multi-stakeholder partnerships? How to improve cooperation between providers of health services, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the police? How to better assess the impact of harm reduction on public health and urban security? What role can drug checking play in reinforcing prevention and harm reduction at the local level? These questions were discussed during lively panel discussions, breakout sessions and workshops, but also during 7 study visits to local harm-reduction services. These visits were organised by the Municipality of Lisbon in cooperation with the NGOs CRESCER, Medicos do Mundo, GAT and Ares do Pinhal, as well as the parish of Lumiar and the EMCDDA. Co-producing balanced drug policies in Europe  In her keynote speech, Ruth Dreifuss, former President of the Swiss Confederation and Chair of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, called on the participants to further intensify and professionalise their efforts in the face of a current global pushback against progressive drug policies: “My experience has led me to believe that cities are the level where reforms are required and can take place, beyond national legislation. This is where professionals from health service providers, law enforcement and policymakers are working together on the ground. We should not wait for a technical organisation with a limited mandate to tell us what to do in order to save lives and ensure the safety of our citizens”.    Alexis Goosdeel, EMCDDA Director, said: “I am particularly pleased to see so many health, security and law enforcement practitioners together at this conference. Multi-sectoral cooperation at the local level is what will make the difference in the future. We must prepare new generations to continue this work.”   Nuno Veludo, advisor for health policy at the Lisbon City Council (CML), stressed the link between harm reduction, drug policy and democracy: “We must reinforce our measures to support drug users and other vulnerable groups and empower them to participate actively in local democracy and public deliberation - all citizens have an equally important place in the public sphere.”  Bernard Rivaillé, Deputy Mayor of Lormont and member of Efus’ executive committee, stressed the need for peer-to-peer support among cities: “Through the promotion and exchange of experiences and successful practices between European cities, we wish to continue to work on this issue by mobilising local elected representatives and all local actors in order to bring out the full potential of drug prevention projects and programmes.”  Read full news release in EN and FR >> 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/12/solidify-project-supervised-drug-consumption-facilities_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0102	2019-11-26	UNK	New report highlights wide-ranging impacts of EU drug markets on health and security	 Europeans are spending at least EUR 30 billion on drugs each year at retail level, making the drug market a major source of income for organised crime groups in the European Union. This figure is announced today in the 2019 EU Drug Markets Report, released by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and Europol (1). Around two-fifths of this total (39%) is spent on cannabis, 31% on cocaine, 25% on heroin and 5% on amphetamines and MDMA (Figure 1.1) (2). Figure 1.1 The two agencies have joined forces to provide their third state-of-the art overview of the European illicit drug market. The report covers trends along the supply chain from production and trafficking to distribution and sales. It describes how the drug market has wide-ranging impacts on both health and security and how a holistic approach is crucial for effective drug control policies. Presenting the report’s findings today, Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship said: ‘Organised crime groups are quick to seize new opportunities for financial gain and are increasingly exploiting technological and logistical innovations to expand their activities across international borders. At the same time, drugs are now more accessible to European consumers, often via social media and the internet. Today’s report proves once again that the illicit drug market remains a threat to the health and security of our citizens. We will continue working relentlessly with our Member States and international partners on strengthening our fight against drugs in all its aspects; for our youth, our citizens, our society.’ The strategic and action-oriented analysis combines data from the EMCDDA’s drug monitoring system with Europol’s operational intelligence on organised crime. The latest data (3) show that overall drug availability within Europe remains ‘very high’ and that consumers have access to a wide variety of high-purity and high-potency products at steady, or falling, prices. An important cross-cutting theme in the report is the environmental impact of drug production, including deforestation and the dumping of chemical waste, which can result in ecological damage, safety risks and high clean-up costs. Rising violence and corruption linked to EU drug market activity The report highlights the increasing importance of Europe, both as a target and drug-producing region, and shows how the violence and corruption, long seen in traditional drug-producing countries, are now increasingly evident within the EU. Among the wide-ranging consequences of the drug market presented in the analysis are its negative impacts on society (e.g. gang violence, drug-related homicide) and the strain on public institutions and governance. The drug market’s links to wider criminal activity (e.g. human trafficking, terrorism) are also explored, along with its negative repercussions on the legal economy (e.g. how money laundering associated with the drug trade undermines legitimate businesses) (see Part I info graphic and Figure 1.2). Figure 1.2 Trade, tech and criminal tools — driving and facilitating the market According to the report, globalisation, technology and innovation and criminal tools are three forces driving and facilitating drug market developments. In a ‘more globally connected and technologically enabled’ market, organised crime groups are exploiting opportunities arising from expanding commercial markets, associated logistical developments and digitalisation. The report raises concerns over the greater diversification of maritime drug trafficking (Figure 2.4) and the misuse of general aviation (e.g. private aircraft, drones) for criminal purposes (Figure 2.5). The use of post and parcel services to transport drugs is also expanding rapidly, following the rising trend of online shopping in Europe and the movement of larger volumes of goods. Figure 2.4 Figure 2.5 Surface web and darknet markets, as well as social media, messaging services and mobile apps provide avenues for online drug sales. While darknet markets remain resilient (around 10 are still operating today — Figure 2.8), online vendor shops and markets targeting specific nationalities and language groups have also appeared. Illegal firearms, encrypted smartphones and fraudulent documents are among the key criminal tools increasingly used by drug dealers. Figure 2.8 EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘This report is a clear wake-up call for policymakers to address the rapidly growing drug market, which is increasingly global, joined-up and digitally enabled. Hyper production of drugs, within and beyond EU borders, is leading to high availability of natural and synthetic substances. This means that consumers now have access to a diverse range of highly potent and pure products at affordable prices. A mounting concern is the rise in drug-related violence and corruption within the EU. Acting on the far-reaching consequences of the drug market for health and for security must now be an urgent priority.’ Europol’s Executive Director Catherine De Bolle stresses: ‘Europol sees a clear increase in trafficking activity through our operational work and the intelligence contributions we receive from EU Member States. Law enforcement needs to tackle this development and that is why we are investing heavily in supporting drug-related investigations in Europe. Europol is targeting in particular top-level organised crime groups which are making a lot of money for themselves on the back of their many victims.’ Key drug markets under the microscope The report takes an in-depth look at the markets for the main drugs used in Europe, following the flow from production to use. Cannabis — products increasingly diverse: Estimated to be worth at least EUR 11.6 billion, this is the largest drug market in Europe, with some 25 million Europeans (15–64 years) having used the drug in the past year. The report illustrates that, while cannabis herb and resin still dominate, cannabis products are increasingly diverse in Europe. High-potency extracts, cannabis-based medicinal and health-orientated products and an increasing number of cannabidiol (CBD) or low-THC products are being sold in a range of forms (Figure 3.1). This makes close monitoring of their potency and potential health effects essential. Increased violence between organised crime groups dealing in cannabis is putting an added strain on law enforcement.   Figure 3.1 Heroin and other opioids — severe health risks and precursor concerns: Opioid use still accounts for the largest proportion of harms, including deaths, associated with illicit drug consumption in the EU. With some 1.3 million problem opioid users (mainly of heroin) in the EU, the estimated retail value of the heroin market is at least EUR 7.4 billion per year. The Balkan route remains the key corridor for heroin into the EU, but there are signs of increased heroin trafficking along the Southern route, particularly through the Suez Canal (Figure 4.8). There is also evidence of diversion and trafficking of the heroin precursor acetic anhydride from the EU to heroin producing areas. Highly potent synthetic opioids (e.g. fentanyl derivatives) represent a growing health risk.These are increasingly traded online and dispatched by post, often in small packages containing large numbers of potential user doses. Figure 4.8 Cocaine — record production and expanding markets: This is the second most commonly consumed illicit drug in the EU, with a market retail value estimated at EUR 9.1 billion. Around 4 million Europeans (15–64 years) report having used the drug in the past year. Use is still concentrated in the south and west of Europe but the market appears to be spreading. Record production in Latin America has intensified trafficking to the EU (mainly in maritime containers), where record seizures have been recorded. The presence of European organised crime groups in Latin America allows them to manage the supply chain ‘end-to-end’. This may be driving competition within the cocaine market, which is linked to violence within the EU. The EU appears to be emerging as a transit area for cocaine destined for other markets (e.g. Middle East, Asia). Amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDMA — large-scale production in Europe for domestic consumption and export: These make up around 5% of the total EU drug market, with an estimated EU retail market value of at least EUR 1 billion for amphetamine and methamphetamine and EUR 0.5 billion for MDMA. Around 1.7 million Europeans (15–64 years) have tried amphetamine or methamphetamine in the past year and some 2.6 million have tried MDMA (‘ecstasy’). Production of these substances takes place sometimes on an ‘industrial scale’ within the EU for domestic consumption and for export. New production methods yield purer and cheaper products, with organised crime groups controlling the whole logistics chain. New psychoactive substances (NPS) — fewer new detections but potent substances pose serious health threats: These are diverse substances which are not subject to international drug controls. The value of the NPS market is unknown, however 55 NPS were reported to the EU Early Warning System in 2018, bringing the total number of NPS monitored to 731.The main source countries are China and, to a lesser extent, India.Policy responses and law enforcement activity in source countries are thought to have contributed to the slow-down in appearance of NPS (101 were reported in 2014). But NPS continue to pose serious cross-border threats to health, with potent synthetic opioids, cannabinoids and ‘fake’ benzodiazepines appearing on the market, associated with reports of health emergencies and deaths. Tackling drug markets: actions for current and future scenarios In a drug market which is ‘increasingly complex, adaptive and dynamic’, the report stresses that ‘EU policies and responses need to be equally agile, adaptive and joined-up.’ The report presents a wide array of ongoing actions to target the illicit drug supply chain, from operational measures to tackle corruption at ports to training for officials in dismantling illicit drug laboratories. It also describes a full range of policy tools available (e.g. coordination structures, legislation, cooperation programmes and financial instruments). Among the key areas for action identified in the report are: tackling the business models of top-level organised crime groups active in the global drug market; reducing vulnerabilities at external borders; and investing in forensic and toxicological capacity to keep pace with innovations in drug production. The agencies stress that taking a future-oriented approach will boost preparedness to respond to potential future challenges, such as virtual currencies, drone technology, automation in supply chain logistics and artificial intelligence. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/new-report-highlights-wide-ranging-impacts-eu-drug-markets-health-and-security_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0103	2019-11-18	UNK	Coming soon: 2019 EU Drug Markets Report from the EMCDDA and Europol	 Drug trafficking is a highly profitable commercial activity and remains a core business for organised crime groups across Europe today. Understanding the reality of the European drug market requires a holistic approach, following the supply chain from production and trafficking to distribution and sales. Taking such an approach, two EU agencies — the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and Europol — have joined forces to provide their third state-of-the art overview of the European illicit drug market in the 2019 EU Drug Markets Report. To be launched in Brussels on 26 November, this strategic and action-oriented analysis combines data from the EMCDDA’s drug monitoring system with Europol’s operational intelligence on organised crime. The 250-page graphic-rich report (including an executive summary) is accompanied by 12 supporting papers addressing gaps identified in the 2016 edition. A news release, with the main highlights, will be available in 24 languages, while graphics will be downloadable from an online media library.

EMCDDA_UNK_0104	2019-11-18	UNK	Director's speech: EU-Western Balkans Cooperation on Drugs: Challenges and Perspectives	 Occasion: Presentation at the EU-Western Balkans Ministerial Forum on Justice and Home Affairs, 18–19 November 2019, Skopje, North Macedonia 1. Recent trends and developments The drugs situation has become more serious in recent years and can be characterised as follows: Significant increases in the availability of all substances: record high seizures of cocaine in Europe (following an increase in cocaine production in Colombia); recent significant seizures of heroin in Europe; over 1 million seizures of illicit drugs are reported annually. In 2018, 55 new psychoactive substances (NPS) were detected in the EU for the first time, bringing the total number monitored by the agency to more than 730. We are also witnessing an evolving market where synthetic drugs and drug production within Europe are growing in importance. In parallel, we have observed an increase in the purity and potency of substances being used in the EU, with an average concentration of THC of 10% in herbal cannabis and 18% in cannabis resin; 125 milligrams of MDMA as an average in ecstasy pills; the availability of highly potent new psychoactive substances (NPS); cocaine being available at the highest levels of purity observed in the last decade, while the price remains stable. Around 96 million adults in the EU (15–64 years) have tried an illicit drug in their lifetime and an estimated 1.2 million people receive treatment each year for problems related to illicit drug use (EU-28). There is evidence that the use of social media, darknet marketplaces and encryption techniques are playing an increasing role in enabling individuals and smaller criminal groups to engage in drug dealing. In the last five years we have also observed in some EU Member States an increase in drug-related deaths. Over 8 200 deaths, involving one or more illicit drugs, were reported in 2017 in the EU. This estimate exceeds 9 400 deaths when Norway and Turkey are included. While opioids remain the main driver of fatal overdoses in Europe, often heroin,  opioids used in substitution treatment or medications, such as oxycodone and tramadol, are also reported. Deaths associated with fentanyl and its analogues are probably underestimated, and outbreaks of deaths related to these substances have been reported. Stimulants — including cocaine and other substances such as benzodiazepines — are also involved in many deaths. Although the Western Balkans have been frequently described as a region with a low-moderate problem associated to drug availability and drug use, there are indications that the situation is changing. Those changes are observed for all dimensions of the phenomenon in the region concerning drug production, drug trafficking and drug use. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive overhaul of the priorities for cooperation with the EU. 2. Cooperation between the EMCDDA and the Western Balkans The EMCDDA’s mission is twofold: To inform the EU and the Member States on drug-related cross-border health and security threats, covering, not only the EU, but also candidate countries and potential candidates, and neighbouring countries. To support the Enlargement Strategy of the EU and to provide technical support to candidate countries and potential candidates for their approximation to the EU acquisand for the implementation of their respective action plans in the area of Justice and Home Affairs. Successes: We have managed to establish some good cooperation at scientific and technical level. Through our technical cooperation project financed by CARDS and then IPA, we have the possibility to provide direct support to capacity building and data collection. As a result, a first regional report on the drugs situation was published five years ago. Each country has had at least one general population survey (GPS) since 2014, following EU standards. Almost all countries have conducted two waves of ESPAD school surveys: in 2019 ESPAD took place in Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia; the survey was cancelled in Albania despite the availability of financial support from EMCDDA. Those surveys also allow the partner countries to provide more, or better, data to the UN as part of the Annual Report Questionnaire (ARQ). National experts participate in key scientific meetings organised by the EMCDDA. Today the EMCDDA has a Working Arrangement for cooperation with Albania, and is expected to sign one with Serbia by the end of 2019 or at the beginning of 2020. After assessment and consultation with the partner countries, the EMCDDA published in 2015 a roadmap for each country: they are updated on a yearly basis and feed the drafting of the progress report. A check-list and guidelines exist for the establishment of national early warning systems (NEWS) on new psychoactive substances (NPS) that are used both for training and for the assessment and validation of the existing ones. So far, only the Serbian NEWS has reached an acceptable level of development that will allow for formal technical exchanges with the EMCDDA. Challenges: In many countries there is legislation or a national strategy or an action plan on drugs that foresees the establishment of a national focal point and of a national early warning system on new psychoactive substances (NPS), but the NFP is only a reality in Serbia. In some countries, there has been a first mid-term evaluation of the implementation of the national strategy with the support of the EMCDDA and/or TAIEX, but the conclusions and recommendations have not yet been implemented. In almost all countries, there is insufficient support for building the national capacity for cooperating and for reporting, and this includes a lack of human resources. Lack of institutional support leads to IPA project budgets and key activities being cancelled. All countries are confronted with a situation of increased drug production, trafficking and consumption that has a negative impact at national and international level. Some data collection is well-developed thanks to the support of the Global Fund (GF), but there is no, or poor, sustainability since the withdrawal of the GF from the region. The rise of the activities of organised crime groups in a broad set of criminal activities, including drug trafficking, does not receive adequate levels of priority and of funding from national authorities. There is a lack of supply indicator data. After several trainings and an in-depth assessment of available data and recommendations for improving their quality, the EMCDDA has received a first submission of data on seizures; however, they are not yet in line with the EMCDDA protocol. 3. Perspectives The new IPA 7 project that started on 1 July 2019, with specific funding from the IPA programme of the European Commission, provides the basis and the resources to boost the cooperation between the Centre and the Western Balkans countries, along with the mission and mandate of the EMCDDA. 1. Identifying and collecting more broadly any relevant source of information on the drugs situation at regional, national or at local level There are many sources of information in the region that may be useful and relevant for the EMCDDA to fulfil its role of detection and assessment of drug-related health and security threats. While those sources come from different sectors and providers with a variable quality and coverage, and with a variable institutional setting (State, cities, universities, international donors, NGOs), they are all potentially useful and represent frequently the only information available. What matters here is the sound scientific assessment of these data and their integration into a holistic model for strategic analysis, which is where lies the expertise of the EMCDDA. In the new IPA 7 project, a comprehensive screening and assessment of available information will be conducted and will serve as a basis to complement and to update the work done some years ago for the production of the first report on the drugs situation in the Western Balkans. 2. Preparing the next EU Drug Markets Report 2022 The reinforced investment in data collection and analysis along with a strengthened cooperation with the partner countries will help in the preparation of the next EU Drug Markets Report 2022. 3. Support to drug policies, scientific evidence, reliable data and systematic monitoring of the drugs situation The approach developed over the last 25 years introduced a sequence of key steps which have become an intrinsic part of the EU decision-making process: to understand the situation, to analyse the needs, to design interventions and to evaluate their results and their impact. On that basis, the EMCDDA has published a 7-step guide that will be made available to the Western Balkans countries, as has already been done for Montenegro and Serbia. 4. A regular reporting/exchange to/with the JHA Ministerial Forum As one of the main weaknesses identified so far is the lack of strong and sustained institutional support, regular reporting to, and dialogue with, all partners and international agencies would allow for increased awareness of decision-makers and would provide a unique space for inter-agency dialogue on new and emerging trends. 5. A balanced approach between demand and supply reduction The drugs policy in the EU is also guided and inspired by the provisions of the Treaties and in particular by the Charter on Fundamental Rights, which has legal force and is applicable to all persons living in the EU, including persons who use drugs. This common reference is partly reflected in the way most of the EU Member States address the situation of persons using drugs or being found in possession of small quantities for personal use. In this context, the EU and its Member States have progressively developed a portfolio of evaluated and well-documented interventions, based on the scientific evidence available and presented with criteria for good practice, which compose a common ‘European Toolbox’ of interventions in demand reduction. The EMCDDA is in charge of gathering and analysing the evidence and the best practice criteria that compose this toolbox, with a priority to support the implementation of those best practices at national or at local level. Another important pillar in the work of the agency is the work in the area of ’Risks to public safety and security’, and the development of a full set of supply indicators. The EMCDDA is also one of the key contributors to EMPACT. All those activities in the area of Justice and Home Affairs would benefit from strong support from national authorities — this support is key to better detect, understand and anticipate new emerging trends in drug use and drug trafficking. 4. Conclusions Working Arrangements, such as those signed or to be signed with Albania and Serbia, are an important sign that cooperation is being upgraded and that it is gaining traction for the benefit of the countries themselves, of the EU agencies and of the EU. The EMCDDA, through its new IPA 7 project, is more than ever in a position to provide hands-on technical support and scientific advice, and remains at the entire disposal of the national delegations at the JHA Ministerial Forum to discuss specific national needs and situations.

EMCDDA_UNK_0105	2019-11-12	UNK	EU Agencies join 10-year anniversary of EU’s Fundamental Rights Charter	 The nine EU Justice and Home Affairs Agencies are marking the 10-year anniversary of the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights by pledging to continue to respect and promote fundamental rights throughout the work. 'The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction contributes to a healthier and more secure Europe by enabling better informed decisions and actions on drugs. Protecting fundamental rights is a priority for our work and all our activities are underpinned by the principles embodied in the Charter.' The agencies have agreed to continue to promote and protect fundamental rights throughout their work. This includes ensuring their work always complies with the Charter. They will continue to uphold fundamental rights in their working practices such as promoting gender equality and diversity at work. They will also run awareness raising activities, staff training, joint activities to increase awareness about the Charter and its entitlements. In addition, they will continue to build and enhance their capacity to respect the Charter by sharing and exchanging best practices.

EMCDDA_UNK_0106	2019-11-08	UNK	EMCDDA Best practice portal update	 Neurostimulation techniques for the treatment of substance use The continuous research on the treatment of substance use dependence has identified the potential of some neurostimulation techniques to reduce substance use and cravings. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), for instance, is a non-invasive and relatively painless procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate small regions of the brain to treat or improve a variety of symptoms and conditions. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is increasingly used in the treatment of substance use dependence, particularly of nicotine, but also of alcohol and illicit substances. Yet its effectiveness remains undetermined. A recent systematic review of several rTMS protocols has found no conclusive evidence of effectiveness on reduced substance use or cravings, even though some particular protocols showed promising results. Evidence summaries are available at the Best practice portal. Gabapentin in the treatment of substance use disorders Gabapentin (GBP) is an anticonvulsant medication used in the treatment of seizures, restless legs syndrome and other conditions. Although an increasing number studies propose the use of GBP for the treatment of substance use disorders, a recent systematic review found no significant evidence of effect of GBP for substance use dependence.  Brief interventions for cannabis use Brief interventions (BIs) are short interventions consisting of one of several sessions, each taking between 5 to 60 minutes, usually conducted individually and in-person. In the new round of updates to the Best practice portal, we found there were insufficient data to conclude that brief interventions (BIs) for cannabis use in postsecondary settings are either effective or ineffective. Spiritual/religious interventions Spiritual/religious interventions are interventions that include a key component of spirituality or religiosity. Prayer, Rites of Passage, and 12-step interventions are some examples. In this new round of updates we found no evidence of effect of spiritual/religious interventions in the treatment of substance use disorders.

EMCDDA_UNK_0107	2019-10-30	UNK	Australian Capital Territory legalises personal cannabis growing and consumption	 On 25 September 2019, the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) approved a law permitting personal cultivation, possession and use of cannabis for recreational purposes. The background note to the act describes the objective as a ‘harm minimisation approach’, stating that ‘the outright prohibition model of drug policy is not working’. The Drugs of Dependence (Personal Use) Amendment Act 2019 enters into force on 31 January 2020. It will exempt people over 18 years old from penalties for cultivation of up to two cannabis plants per person (maximum four plants per household), kept in part of the home not generally accessible by the public, and for possession of up to 50 grams of dried cannabis herb or 150 grams of ‘fresh’ cannabis. This replaces the ‘Simple Cannabis Offence Notice’ (monetary fine) currently given to adults found in possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use, but maintains existing therapeutic and non-therapeutic diversionary schemes for minors. Under the new law, sale or possession of cannabis seeds remains illegal. The drug should not be used knowingly near children or in a public place. No sales outlets are foreseen, and even sharing a small amount will be considered a cannabis supply offence. Cannabis tourism therefore seems unlikely. In a parallel with the United States, this puts state-level criminal law in direct conflict with federal criminal law, which provides for a penalty of up to two years’ imprisonment for possession. However, in Australia the Commonwealth (federal) Criminal Code provides an exception to Commonwealth offences, where conduct is justified or excused under the law of a State or Territory. It is not yet clear whether that exemption may apply in this case. ACT Policing may arrest for breach of Territory or Commonwealth laws, with an offence to be then tried in a Territory court or a Commonwealth court respectively, but it is unclear how this may be decided. The ACT houses the federal capital city of Canberra, and has a population of just under 400 000 in approximately 2 358 square kilometres. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/australian-capital-territory-legalises-personal-cannabis-growing-and-consumption_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0108	2019-10-30	UNK	Visit of the European Parliament LIBE Committee to the EMCDDA 	 On 30 and 31 October, Member of the European Parliament Caterina Chinnici (Italy, S&D) paid an official visit to the EMCDDA on behalf of the EP’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). Over two half days of meetings and discussions, Ms Chinnici exchanged views with EMCDDA experts on the latest developments in the drug situation in Europe and on the challenges the agency is currently facing in its everyday work. She also met with the Deputy General Director of SICAD Manuel Cardoso. The meeting was chaired by Fabian Pereyra, Head of the Executive Office at the EMCDDA, who presented the agency’s activities and contribution to a healthier and more secure Europe and shared the results of the 2018 external evaluation of the EMCDDA. MEP Chinnici was accompanied by two political advisors — Aurélien Mazuy (S&D) and Lide Iruin Ibarzabal (GUE/NGL) — and by two representatives of the LIBE Committee Secretariat — Moira Andreanelli and Angela Hrincescu. The Head of the European Parliament Information Office in Portugal, Pedro Valente da Silva, also participated in the visit. ‘Although less present in the public debate today than they were a couple of decades ago, drugs have not disappeared from our societies’, commented Ms Chinnici. The MEP continued: ‘Illicit drug trafficking continues to be one of the most profitable criminal markets in Europe, with established and new substances threatening the health of a large part of the European population. Available data suggest that critical changes may be in progress in the drugs market — which is developing also online — and in drug use trends in European countries and worldwide. Within this context, I very much appreciate the commitment of the EMCDDA, under the lead of its Director Alexis Goosdeel, to provide factual and objective information to support evidence-based decisions at EU and national level’. Recent data from the 2019 European Drug Report were presented during the meeting and an exchange of views took place on international drug-related policy challenges, mainly relating to cannabis. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/visit-european-parliament-libe-committee-emcdda_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0109	2019-10-22	UNK	News from EU4Monitoring Drugs, the EMCDDA’s technical cooperation project	 This content was published in the second EU4MD update released on 22.10.2019. This update also presents a section on partnerships and related activities, upcoming events, and a research corner. Professionalising drug prevention in EU4MD partner countries A professional prevention workforce is important for the development, planning and implementation of effective prevention systems and activities. To this effect, the EU4Monitoring Drugs (EU4MD) project supports the dissemination of evidence-based drug prevention among prevention professionals in partner countries. In July this year, the EU4MD supported the participation of drug prevention professionals from Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Israel, Lebanon, Palestine(*) and Ukraine to a three-day workshop on evidence-based prevention interventions and approaches based on the European Universal Prevention Curriculum (EUPC). The workshop was organised under the scope of the International Conference on Drug Prevention, Treatment and Care, hosted by the International Society for Substance Use Professionals (ISSUP) and the UNODC in Vienna, Austria. As a follow-up of the workshop, representatives from Georgia and Lebanon were invited to attend the first EUPC Training of Trainers course in Lisbon on 24-26 September, which coincided with the launch of the new European Prevention Curriculum (EUPC) handbook by the EMCDDA. The course was organised by the EMCDDA in partnership with the EU-funded project ASAP and it brought together 29 participants from 11 countries. After following two three-day training courses of this kind and a final exam, successful participants will gain the status of European Master Trainers. The qualification will allow the trainers to cascade evidence-based prevention knowledge through providing courses in their own country and language. As part of its commitment to supporting the professionalisation of drug prevention, the EU4MD is also planning to translate the EUPC training materials into key languages of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) area and to roll out regional Training of Trainers courses in the eastern and southern ENP areas in 2020 and 2021.  * This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue. Interview with Rasha Abi Hana, Service Development Coordinator at the National Mental Health Programme in the Ministry of Public Health in Lebanon Your name and role in your institute My name is Rasha Abi Hana. I am the Service Development Coordinator at the National Mental Health Programme in the Ministry of Public Health in Lebanon. My responsibilities are primarily: to plan, coordinate and evaluate capacity-building interventions; to set up and monitor SOPs for Mental Health and Substance use services in the community centres; to ensure high-quality mental health and substance use services in line with clearly defined national and international standards; to integrate substance use brief interventions; and to develop a comprehensive referral system. Your past involvement in prevention responses/activities in your country In line with the national strategy – the Inter-Ministerial Substance Use Response Strategy for Lebanon 2016-2021 – our interventions at the National Mental Health Programme are focusing on ensuring the identification, and implementation of evidence-based strategies and interventions for the prevention of substance use as well as promoting these interventions at the national level to help raise awareness at individual and community levels through information and education about substance use in different contexts. Since its establishment, the programme has been conducting capacity-building activities for staff in social development centres and collaborating with NGOs in organising preventive activities. At this stage some programmes are being piloted such as the adapted Unplugged, Line Up Live Up, and, as the Ministry of Public Health, we are collaborating with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education for the implementation of a school health programme supporting students in acquiring life skills. Is prevention of drug use a priority in your country? If not, should it be? Prevention is a key sub-domain in the Health and Social Welfare Response Domain, among other important domains, this is clearly highlighted in the ‘Inter-Ministerial Substance Use Response Strategy for Lebanon 2016-2021’. Prevention programmes are being piloted and studied to assess their feasibility and effectiveness in Lebanon as a first step to scaling up programmes. However, and in the absence of allocated funding for prevention activities, the interventions are still limited and implemented on an ad-hoc basis. What did you ‘take home’ from the ASAP & EMCDDA Training of Trainers workshop? I was thoroughly inspired by the ASAP & EMCDDA Training of Trainers workshop and I appreciated that we learned a lot. The key learning points are mainly better understanding of the prevention science, selection, evaluation and implementation of prevention interventions, and understanding the essential components of an evidence-based intervention in different contexts (family, school, workplace, environment and the media). Finally, this was definitely insightful to promoting evidence-based prevention interventions at the national level. What follow-up action would you like to see in your country in terms of work related to prevention and how can the EU4MD make a difference in this area? Until now, as mentioned above, prevention interventions are done on an ad-hoc basis according to the availability of funding; however many strategic objectives related to prevention are clearly highlighted in the Inter-Ministerial strategy for Lebanon. The EU4MD can support training and capacity-building projects as well as disseminate the culture of evidence-based prevention interventions to different actors in Lebanon in addition to initiating, aligning and strengthening other prevention programmes in the area. Interview with Mariam Razmadze, Coordinator at Institute of Addictology, Ilia State University; Psychologist, Global Initiative on Psychiatry – Tbilisi, Georgia Your name and role in your institute Mariam Razmadze, Coordinator at Institute of Addictology, Ilia State University; Psychologist, Global Initiative on Psychiatry – Tbilisi Your past involvement in prevention responses/activities in your country Piloting and adaptation of the Unplugged programme; working as a psychologist/addictologist at a youth psychosocial centre, which has been established as a selective prevention service; working with adolescents with behavioural and mental health problems; and coordination of an Addiction Research Development Project, funded by TEMPUS & USAID. Is prevention of drug use a priority in your country? If not, should it be? Prevention activities are mostly limited to media campaigns and sporadic activities, such as sport events. Evidence-based interventions are now hopefully becoming more prioritised as the national centre of disease control with the Global Initiative on Psychiatry – Tbilisi has started to train school psychologists in delivering Unplugged to school teachers. It definitely should be a priority as it is one of the most effective and important public health responses to drug demand reduction issues. What did you ‘take home’ from the ASAP & EMCDDA Training of Trainers workshop? The workshop was very insightful in terms of delivery strategies and ways to ensure that the main messages will reach decision- and policymakers. What follow-up action would you like to see in your country in terms of work related to prevention and how can the EU4MD make a difference in this area? The involvement of the EU in developmental projects is very important to us, as it helps us to introduce effective evidence-based solutions to various problems. I would definitely like to see more resources directed towards evidence-based effective programmes and the prioritisation of prevention interventions. Spotlight on partner countries: Ukraine and Jordan Ukraine Serhii Shum PhD, Director of the State Agency ‘The Center for Mental Health and Monitoring of Drugs and Alcohol of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine’, the EMCDDA’s counterpart in the country, speaks about the drug situation in Ukraine. He highlights main challenges and threats, reflects on successful national efforts and gives his views on future cooperation with the EU4MD project. What are the main drug-related challenges facing Ukraine? One of the main obstacles to counteracting effectively the circulation of new psychoactive drugs (NPS) in Ukraine, which by their properties and structure are analogues of illicit drugs and psychotropic substances, is the lack of a legislative mechanism for the prompt detection and establishment of national control over the circulation of such drugs. There is currently no early detection system for NPS at the national level in Ukraine. In the past, there was no comprehensive drug monitoring system at the national level, so the collection and reporting of data to meet international obligations was challenging. Among other challenges is the expert examination of drugs, psychotropic substances, their analogues and precursors, due to a lack of laboratories in Ukraine, limited availability of proper equipment, the absence of a coordinating center that would facilitate the coordination of work and the exchange of information between the expert laboratories. Moreover, there is a need to expand standard samples for laboratories, and specialists of these institutions are in great need of systematic training. Ukraine has endorsed a National Drug Policy Strategy, which will expire at the end of 2020, requiring the development of a new Strategy for the period up to 2025, including determination of priority focus areas regarding drugs. What are the current health and security threats related to drugs? Two of the most important drug-related threats for health and safety in Ukraine are the emergence of NPS that can harm human health and life, and the lack of an early detection system for NPS at the state level. What has been done to address the challenges posed by drugs? The Action Plan for 2019-2020 has been approved and focuses on (i) improving control over the circulation of narcotic medicines, psychotropic substances and precursors, (ii) preventing their diversion into the illicit market, while ensuring their availability for medical purposes, (iii) actions against organised crime, corruption and drug trafficking, and (iv) strengthening legal frameworks. The Government has adopted an Act to monitor the drugs and alcohol situation in Ukraine. A monitoring system for drugs and alcohol will be introduced at the state level; the systematic and continuous collection of information on the circulation of psychoactive substances and their illegal distribution will enable the analysis of drug crime, the evaluation of the mortality rate related to the use of psychoactive substances, the prevention and treatment of psychoactive substance use, and the rehabilitation and re-socialisation of drug-dependent individuals in Ukraine. Within the scope of the Ukrainian Working Group on Research on Psychoactive Substances, a draft governmental act was developed. It provides for the approval of the Procedure for carrying out activities related to the circulation of standard samples of drugs, psychotropic substances and precursors between state specialised institutions. This Procedure will allow for the transfer and exchange of both primary and secondary standard samples of controlled substances between all laboratories for proficiency testing, joint inter-laboratory exercises or other forensic purposes. Where and how can the EU4MD project make a difference? Ukraine would welcome the opportunity for cooperation with the EMCDDA under the scope of the EU4MD in the following matters: Conducting training for experts on drug monitoring indicators in Ukraine; Facilitating the exchange of experiences from other EU countries regarding the development of drug strategies; Assisting in our efforts to better equip forensic laboratories (including the provision of standard samples) to enable expert examinations on drugs, psychotropic substances, their analogues and precursors; Facilitating training interventions and the exchange of experiences (advanced training) for specialists of forensic institutions (laboratories). In addition, Ukraine is very interested in joining the European Union Early Warning System on New Psychoactive Substances. Jordan Major Jamil Al Habaibeh, Head of International Affairs Section, Anti-Narcotics Department (AND), in The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the EMCDDA’s counterpart in the country, speaks about the drug situation in Jordan. He highlights the main challenges and threats, reflects on successful national efforts and gives his views on future cooperation with the EU4MD project. What are the main drug-related issues in Jordan and what has been done to address them? Drug-wise, Jordan is considered a transit country. Cannabis originating from Lebanon and Afghanistan is trafficked to Jordan via Syria, while heroin and Captagon get to Jordan via Turkey and Syria. Drug law enforcement is focused on controlling our extended land borders, especially the desert at the northern borders with Syria and the south east borders with Saudi Arabia. More than 95% of the total amount of seized drugs were transiting Jordan and destined elsewhere. Jordan local authorities maintain continuous cooperation with competent authorities in our region and the world, which has resulted in drugs seizures in many countries, especially pertaining to controlled delivery cases. Jordan is a party to the UN Drug Conventions. In 2008, Jordan established the National Anti-Narcotics Council which has representation from governmental and non-governmental organisations, and aims to address drug-related problems in Jordan. The Council has formulated a comprehensive national strategy in which each entity has been assigned to a specific role in addressing the drugs phenomenon. The Anti-Narcotics Department (AND) of Public Security Directorate is in charge of the implementation of the drug strategy in the country, while precursor control is under the responsibility of the Drugs and Food Administration (DFA). A special team at the Central Bank is the competent authority responsible for money laundering cases. The AND closely cooperates and coordinates its actions with Customs and DFA to control the importing and exporting of precursors for legal use and to prevent any misuse; the Central Bank also provides assistance in the investigation of some drug cases. Jordan has taken measures to increase public awareness of the dangers of drugs through active awareness plans involving a range of stakeholders including school and university students, NGOs, correction and rehabilitation centres, youth clubs, and the media. We have two public drug treatment facilities; one affiliated to the Ministry of Health and the other to the Anti-Narcotics Department of Public Security Directorate. In the first half of 2019, a total of 373 persons were admitted to the AND treatment centre. Recently, the capacity of the public treatment system increased with the development of a new treatment facility with a higher capacity. What are the recent drug-related challenges facing Jordan? The drug situation is well controlled, but we are aware of challenges which we may face in the future. To increase our response potential, we invest in training our officers and bringing new detection devices into service that could help foster eventual responses, although the resources remain limited. A challenge to highlight relates to the constantly changing drug trafficking routes as a result of ongoing instability in Syria. Initially, the sea route was primarily used for drugs smuggling. Now that the land border between Jordan and Syria is open again, there is a need for vigilance over a possible return to the land route for the trafficking of Captagon and heroin. Moreover, continued vigilance of what is happening on the border with Iraq is also important. Appearance of synthetic cannabinoids has resulted in new patterns of drug use. Thus, in 2018 we seized more than 155 kg of synthetic cannabinoids. We also see that the Darknet is increasingly used by drug traffickers for smuggling and distributing the substance, and this is something new for us. Where and how can the EU4MD project make a difference? Jordan has a very close cooperation with the UNODC, the EU and the Pompidou Group of the European Council, mainly to enhance the capacity of our officers to address drug-related issues. Examples of this cooperation include the EUROMED Police project, and awareness raising among youth and on drug treatment for the police officers with the Pompidou Group. In addition, we have direct contacts with our counterparts, especially in the neighbouring countries, and with attaché officers at most of the embassies in Amman. For the EU4Monitoring Drugs project, started this year, the AND is looking forward to implementing activities aimed at the capacity building of the AND to effectively respond to new challenges in countering drug trafficking, tackling distribution of drugs through the Darknet and in strengthening prevention and drug treatment in the country. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/update-eu4monitoring-drugs-project-Oct_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0112	2019-10-14	UNK	Registration now open for the ninth European drugs summer school	 The University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL) and the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) will be joining forces once again next summer to hold the ninth European drugs summer school (EDSS) on ‘Illicit drugs in Europe: demand, supply and public policies’ (1). Registration is now open for the two-week course, which will take place in the Portuguese capital from 29 June to 10 July (2). Through a multidisciplinary and interactive approach to the drugs problem, EMCDDA scientific experts, leading academics, guest speakers, policymakers and professionals having participated in previous rounds of the EDSS, will prepare participants to meet the complex policy challenges in this field — both in Europe and beyond. The focus of the 2020 course will be hepatitis C. Week 1 of the summer school, focusing on the ‘Drugs problem: substance use and problems, substance characteristics, and market’, will feature lectures on: the global burden of drug-related problems; drug markets in Europe; detecting new drugs; and prevention approaches in demand-reduction interventions. This session will also focus on the EMCDDA’s epidemiological indicators and their use in informing drug policy. Week 2, dedicated to ‘Policymaking for drug-related issues’, will include lectures on: drug policies and new challenges (concepts, issues and analysis); the use of evidence to inform decision making; drug laws; and monitoring supply reduction and drug enforcement activity. It will also include group discussion exercises on how to use the knowledge acquired during the course, to sustain drug-related debates. Finally, students will be guided through an analysis of the link between evidence and decision-making, including examples of implementation. Study visits to outreach facilities and to one of the Portuguese commissions for dissuasion will be organised over the two weeks. During the course, students will also participate in interactive workshops to discuss their own projects and views. The course will conclude with an open debate with guest speakers. The target audiences for the EDSS are: university students, researchers, professionals and administrators interested in working on drug issues. The previous rounds of the summer school brought together students from the EU Member States as well as from Africa, Asia, Australia and the Americas.

EMCDDA_UNK_0113	2019-09-27	UNK	Hepatitis elimination barometer — focus of new report	 The EMCDDA is working with its expert network on drug-related infectious diseases (DRID) on an ‘elimination barometer’ for viral hepatitis to help countries assess progress towards eliminating hepatitis C and B among people who inject drugs (PWID). This barometer is the focus of a new EMCDDA Technical report published today: Monitoring the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat among people who inject drugs in Europe. Following the 2016 Global health sector strategy on viral hepatitis, WHO-Europe produced an action plan in 2017 for the health sector response to viral hepatitis in the WHO European region. The goal is to achieve a reduction in the incidence of chronic HBV and HCV infections of 90% by 2030, and a reduction in mortality from chronic HBV and HCV infections of 65% by 2030 (compared to 2015). The EMCDDA barometer complements these elimination initiatives with a specific focus on people who inject drugs. This new tool, designed to assess the epidemiological situation of hepatitis B and C in different countries, is divided into five areas (‘building blocks’): context and needs; inputs; prevention; testing and linkage to care; and impact. Each of these blocks includes a set of quantitative and/or qualitative indicators along with the corresponding WHO 2020 targets. For each of the five building blocks, the report provides a European overview (up to the last quarter of 2018) as well as corresponding country-specific data and case studies, illustrating national contexts and experiences. The data cover the EU, Norway and Turkey. Findings ‘at a glance’ Context and needs: While the available data show that the burden of HCV and HBV is high among PWID, the report reveals that there are still information gaps in many countries, including a lack of core data on the size of the PWID population and routine prevalence estimates for chronic HCV infections in this group. Inputs: As far as national policies are concerned, the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals have had an impact on the adoption of national hepatitis policies in Europe. This can be seen in the content of policies adopted since 2015, which reflect countries’ commitments to the Sustainable Development Goal on health, often embracing the viral hepatitis elimination goal. While all new policies consider PWID to be an important risk group, in the last quarter of 2018, 11 EU Member States had yet to adopt an explicit viral hepatitis policy that was inclusive of this group. Prevention: Prevention and harm reduction measures (e.g. opioid substitutions treatment, needle exchange programmes and HBV vaccination) reduce the risk of infection among injectors and are cost-effective. Harm reduction programmes are also key entry points for testing drug users for hepatitis, linking them to care and reducing the risk of reinfection after a successful HCV treatment. The building block on prevention shows that the coverage of measures known to prevent HCV and HBV infections is sub-optimal in many Member States. Scaling up equitable and tailored prevention measures, for PWID is needed to have an impact and to reach the elimination targets. Testing and linkage to care: Testing for viral hepatitis is the first component of the cascade of care (i.e. sequential stages of medical care from diagnosis and cure). Despite the fact that testing is offered in harm reduction services and in the prison system in a majority of the countries studied, the low coverage of testing in the last year among PWID in the community reflects missed opportunities for diagnosis. Clinical and financial barriers still prevent access to a safe and effective treatment in some Member States. Impact: It may be too early to see the impact of a strategy that was put in place after 2016 in some countries. The data may nevertheless suggest that the current level of prevention, harm reduction and treatment among PWID is too low to achieve a significant reduction in the incidence of chronic HCV infections by 2020, as is also suggested by modelling work. In its final recommendations, the report states that although having a national, well-funded hepatitis policy that is inclusive of PWID is not a sufficient condition for achieving the elimination targets, it is a necessary one. It also proposes the use of public health guidance documents to support the implementation of evidence-based infectious disease prevention methods. In 2018, the EMCDDA launched a ‘hepatitis testing initiative’ to support countries in increasing access to hepatitis care through drug services, providing tools to assess the need for services; identify barriers to care; and develop a plan of action to improve the response to the virus. This is in line with its Strategy 2025, through which it contributes to a healthier and more secure Europe by promoting the delivery of such responses. The EMCDDA will update the barometer on an annual basis with new data from its DRID network.

EMCDDA_UNK_0115	2019-09-24	UNK	New EMCDDA manual and training courses for professionalising drug prevention 	 Advancing the professionalism of the drug prevention workforce in Europe is at the heart of a new European Prevention Curriculum (EUPC) handbook, launched today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). The manual is designed to train professionals who are involved in shaping prevention decisions, opinions and policies in Europe in the science-based prevention of substance use (1). There has been much progress over the past 20 years, both in Europe and internationally, in developing responsible and evidence-based interventions in substance use prevention. Yet, prevention practices for which there is little, or no, evidence of effectiveness are still being implemented in school and community settings today. In the worst cases, poorly designed interventions may even cause harm. The new handbook represents an important step towards achieving the agency’s goal, outlined in EMCDDA Strategy 2025, to support interventions to prevent drug use which are based on evidence. It provides practical overviews of a variety of topics (e.g. aetiology, epidemiology, monitoring and evaluation) as well as prevention in diverse settings (e.g. family, school, workplace, community, media and the broader environment). The aim of the EUPC initiative is to implement a standardised prevention training curriculum in Europe and improve the overall effectiveness of prevention. Adapted from the Universal Prevention Curriculum by the EU-funded UPC-Adapt group, the handbook is based on international standards but with a European slant (2). EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel said: ‘I believe that Europe will greatly benefit from a professional prevention workforce that values prevention science, has the support of public institutions and is trained in, and knowledgeable about, approaches that are empirically tested and likely to yield results. The EUPC manual and training series aim to reduce the health, social and economic problems associated with substance use by strengthening the expertise of those who influence the development of prevention systems, cultures and activities in their regions.’ European Master Trainers — cascading knowledge on evidence-based prevention This week, the EMCDDA joins forces with the EU-funded project ASAP training for quality in prevention to deliver the first EUPC ‘training of trainers’ course in Lisbon (3). Following two three-day training courses of this kind and a final exam, successful participants will gain the status of European Master Trainers. The qualification will allow the trainers to cascade evidence-based prevention knowledge through courses in their own country and language. The new handbook forms the main reference material for EUPC training courses, which can be delivered in three forms: online introductory training; training for local or regional decision-, opinion- and policymakers (DOPs); and training in academic settings (future DOPs). This week 29 participants from 11 countries will take part in the training, including two participants from Georgia and the Lebanon funded through the EU4Monitoring Drugs (EU4MD) project, launched by the EMCDDA earlier this year. It is hoped that the EUPC manual and training courses will boost the application and spread of effective modern prevention approaches at local and regional level in Europe and facilitate well-informed choices about funding and implementation priorities.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/new-emcdda-manual-and-training-courses-for-professionalising-drug-prevention_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0117	2019-08-30	UNK	Drug overdoses can be prevented — new resources released	 Latest estimates show that drug overdose deaths in Europe have risen for the fifth consecutive year, with a record 9 461 lives lost in 2017 (EU 28, Turkey and Norway). Reducing drug-related deaths is therefore a major public health challenge. Ahead of International Overdose Awareness Day, the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) launches today three new resources looking at drug overdoses in Europe and the interventions in place to prevent them. Preventing drug-related deaths — risks and responses Most overdose deaths in Europe are linked to the use of opioids (heroin or synthetic opioids), although cocaine, other stimulant drugs and medicines also play a role. In a new online resource, Prevention of drug-related deaths in Europe, the agency provides an overview on the issue and the risk factors involved. Fatal overdoses are most likely to occur in specific situations, such as lost or reduced tolerance to opioids shortly after prison release, hospital discharge, interruption of treatment or completing a course of residential detoxification. Using opioids with other substances (e.g. alcohol, benzodiazepines and other medicines) also increases the risks of death, as does the lack of, or inadequate, response by those witnessing an overdose. The EMCDDA illustrates how overdose prevention can be addressed on three levels: reducing vulnerability to overdose (e.g. accessible treatment and services); reducing the risk of overdose (e.g. retention in opioid substitution treatment, prison aftercare and overdose risk assessments); and reducing the likelihood of fatal outcomes (e.g. take-home naloxone policies and supervision of drug consumption) (see Figure 1). Currently, 87 supervised drug consumption facilities exist in 8 EU Member States, Norway and Switzerland providing a safer drug-using environment (1). Take-home naloxone can save lives — a first overview of programmes Many people overdose in the presence of their partners or peers, therefore empowering friends, family and other bystanders to act effectively, before emergency services arrive at the scene, can save lives. While naloxone — a medicine used to reverse opioid toxicity — has been used in hospitals for over 40 years, it is also now available in the community in many countries (2). The EMCDDA launches today its first overview of Take-home naloxone (THN) programmes in Europe. The new online resource describes how these programmes developed and became more common over the past decade (see timeline). Providing naloxone and training in emergency response to those likely to witness an overdose is set out as an overdose prevention measure in the EU Action Plan on Drugs 2017–2020 and THN programmes are now expanding. In 2019, 11 EU Member States and Norway report running such programmes (see map and national fact sheets) or allowing access to the medicine without a prescription (3). Since 2016, pharmacists in a majority of US states have been able to give out naloxone on the basis of a standing order (and do not require a patient-specific prescription). Prescription-free distribution is now permitted in several other countries worldwide, including Australia, Canada, Italy, the UK and France. Practical solutions have been found to allow non-medical personnel to receive and administer injectable naloxone and enable the distribution of the medication to the homes of potential bystanders. Some countries now make the emergency medication available without a prescription to, or have lifted prescription regulations for, specific establishments or those registered as formally trained. The resource summarises the different products used in THN programmes, including naloxone nasal spray, authorised in 2017 by the European Commission for marketing in all EU countries. Drug overdose deaths in Europe — frequently asked questions Where have drug-related deaths increased most over the last 10 years? Are women and men affected equally? What are the current concerns in Europe? These are some of the questions answered in new Frequently asked questions (FAQs): drug overdose deaths in Europe published today on the EMCDDA website. These present the overdose situation and trends as well as a range of maps and graphics. ‘Focus’ sections highlight overdose trends in Scotland — currently the country with the highest overdose mortality rate per capita in Europe — and illicitly manufactured fentanyl and its derivatives, involved in large numbers of deaths in some countries, including Sweden (which saw a peak in 2017) and Estonia. In Scotland, a country with a high prevalence of high-risk drug use, a record 1 187 drug-related deaths were reported in 2018 (up 27% from 2017). Scotland’s drug-death rate among adults (15–64 years) is higher than those reported for all the EU countries. Most cases in Scotland are associated with opioids (9 in 10) and benzodiazepines (7 in 10), but almost all (85%) involve more than one drug. Recent increases are primarily seen in 35–44 and 45–54 year-olds. Other northern European countries (e.g. Estonia, Sweden, Norway) also have high overdose mortality rates (in some countries, there may be under-reporting). The EMCDDA monitors closely alerts on harms related to fentanyl and its derivatives due to the very high toxicity of these substances and their potential to result in large clusters of incidents and deaths. In 2017, following reports that fentanyl or carfentanil introduced into the heroin supply in the north of England had caused a number of deaths, public health authorities issued warnings on the harms related to these heroin mixtures and advised on naloxone dosing regimes in the event of an overdose. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘Overdose deaths are preventable. We know from research that many of those who die have been struggling and living on the margins of society for years. We know that those who overdose once are at a very high risk of overdosing again. And we know that effective preventive and response measures exist that would allow us to avoid many deaths. Bystanders must also be empowered to save lives and prevent irreversible organ damage with effective medication’. Through its Strategy 2025, the EMCDDA is committed to contributing to a healthier Europe. While opioids are involved in the vast majority of overdose fatalities, other substances (e.g. cocaine, benzodiazepines, synthetic cannabinoids) also contribute to the overdose burden and should not be neglected. The resources released today contribute to a better understanding of drug overdoses and responses to them in Europe to support sound policymaking in this area. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/7/overdose-awareness-day_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0118	2019-07-30	UNK	Latest update on drug-related deaths and mortality in Europe 	 The EMCDDA has published today its latest update on Drug-related deaths and mortality in Europe. The information provided in the report is collected through the EMCDDA’s expert network on drug-related deaths (DRD). The updates presented shed light on important public health challenges faced by European policymakers and stakeholders, with regard to monitoring, prevention, risk assessment, harm reduction and drug treatment. Below are some of the findings ‘At a glance’. Overdose deaths: a very high burden of premature preventable deaths Over 8 200 deaths involving one or more illicit drugs were reported in 2017 in the European Union. This estimate exceeds 9 400 deaths when Norway and Turkey are included. Males account for four-fifths of the drug-induced deaths. Most of the deaths were premature, affecting people in their thirties and forties. Opioids: the main driver of fatal overdoses in Europe Opioids, often heroin, are involved in between eight and nine out of every 10 drug-induced deaths reported in Europe, although this is not true for all countries. Opioids used in substitution treatment are also commonly found in post-mortem analysis in some countries. Deaths related to medications, such as oxycodone and tramadol, are also reported. Deaths associated with fentanyl, its analogues are probably underestimated, and outbreaks of deaths related to these substances have been reported. Stimulants and benzodiazepines involved in many deaths Post-mortem toxicology analyses of overdose cases suggest that in most cases, multiple drug toxicity is implicated. Overall, cocaine is reported in an increasing number of deaths. Increased cocaine injection is also reported in several countries. Synthetic cannabinoids were involved in the majority of drug-induced deaths reported in Turkey in 2017. Fake medicines, diverted medicines and new benzodiazepines are related to an increasing proportion of drug-related deaths in some countries. Benzodiazepines are causing particular concern in Scotland (UK), where they were implicated in more than half of the reported drug-related deaths in 2017, with recent increases driven mainly by deaths involving new benzodiazepines, such as etizolam. High overall mortality among drug users Seven countries reported new data from mortality cohort studies among high-risk drug users. Findings suggest that high-risk drug users are three to seven times more likely to die than their peers of the same age and gender in the general population. The most frequently reported causes of death include overdose, HIV/AIDS, other infections, liver disease, cancer, respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease. The proportion of deaths due to overdose is likely to be underestimated. Responding to drug-related deaths Coverage and diversity of responses to drug-related deaths vary between and within countries. Updates provided on drug consumption rooms and take-home naloxone programmes indicate the expansion of these responses in countries across Europe in 2018. While the evidence base for their effectiveness is growing, more research is needed on these and other responses. Implications for public health and for monitoring There is an ongoing need to improve the epidemiology of drug-related deaths — from a toxicology perspective, in particular — in order to get more accurate and informative figures in Europe. Further implementation of cohort and linkage studies is needed and can be attained with relatively little investment. Additional sources of information offer timelier data — important for early identification of threats — and may be triangulated. These include open source information monitoring and data from acute intoxications presented at hospital emergency units. The report — the most recent edition in the agency’s Rapid Communication series — ends by underlining the need to improve the epidemiology of drug-related deaths in order to obtain more accurate and informative figures. It states: ‘Doing so includes strengthening the completeness and comparability of information available from forensic toxicology sources, if the exact drivers and triggers of deaths and outbreaks are to be understood and tackled. Investing in enhanced monitoring, preparedness and responses in Europe is crucial, particularly against the backdrop of the drug overdose crises currently experienced by the United States and Canada’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/latest-update-on-drug-related-deaths-and-mortality-in-europe_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0119	2019-07-26	UNK	#WorldHepatitisDay: Supporting the HCV elimination agenda –– an EMCDDA initiative to increase access to hepatitis C care in drug services	 Every year, on 28 July, the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners mark World Hepatitis Day. Its aim is to increase awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis and the diseases it causes.The introduction of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy has profoundly changed and improved the clinical management of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and given impetus to the WHO goal of eliminating HCV infection as a public health threat by 2030. Although DAA therapy has provided the tools to achieve this, HCV elimination is dependent on substantially increasing the number of people tested, diagnosed, linked to care and treated. Improving the HCV care cascade among marginalised, high-risk populations –– such as people who inject drugs –– is paramount in these efforts. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘The EMCDDA is fully subscribed to helping European countries prevent and reduce HCV infection among people who inject drugs. Treatments are available that can make the global elimination goal attainable, and national hepatitis policies are increasingly aligned. We must now focus on ensuring those who need care can obtain it. With our hepatitis C initiative we highlight the great potential of drugs services to provide HCV testing, treatment and care. With the help of our tools, countries can systematically assess barriers and facilitators to HCV testing and improve existing practice by applying new models of care, in active cooperation with people who inject drugs. This initiative provides a practical basis to improve the quality and delivery of responses to drug use and contribute to a healthier Europe.’ In 2018, the EMCDDA launched an initiative to support countries in increasing access to hepatitis care through drug services, providing tools to assess the need for services; identify barriers to care; and develop a plan of action to improve the response to the virus. To mark World Hepatitis Day 2019, the EMCDDA is launching a new set of hepatitis resources: an outline of the EMCDDA initiative and results of pilot tests conducted in the first half of 2019; a compilation of 11 case studies from eight European countries, illustrating new approaches to enhance the HCV care cascade among people who inject drugs, containing findings about effectiveness, sustainability and transferability of these new models of care; and, a knowledge questionnaire designed to refresh knowledge and identify training needs around hepatitis C among practitioners working in drug services (currently available in English, German and Polish). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/world-hepatitis-day-2019-supporting-hcv-elimination-agenda-emcdda-initiative_en

The meeting marks EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel’s first official visit to Russia, and is a follow-up to a Russian official visit to the EMCDDA in September last year. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Federal Drug Control Service (FDCS) of the Russian Federation and the EMCDDA was signed in the margins of the EU–Russia summit in October 2007. In January 2018, the EMCDDA was officially informed that the Ministry of Interior of the Russian Federation was in a position to continue cooperating with the EMCDDA under the MoU. The 2007 MoU allows for an exchange of information and expertise in a number of areas. With this foundation Russian experts have attended EMCDDA Expert meetings on an ad hoc basis, and progress has been made in the areas of data collection methodology and data sharing in key areas. The current meeting (from 23-24 July) took place at the invitation of the Russian Ministry of internal affairs and included a meeting with representatives from the National Research Institute of Narcology. The Director and the EMCDDA delegation also took the opportunity to meet the Deputy Minister of health of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Kostennikov, the head of the EU delegation to Russia, Markus Ederer, and the Moscow Scientific and Practical Center of Narcology. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/eu-and-russian-drugs-agency-representatives-meet-in-moscow_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0121	2019-07-18	UNK	EMCDDA Director pays official visit to Montenegro	 EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel is paying his first official visit to Montenegro this week where he will meet high-level dignitaries working in the drugs field. Over two days (17–18 July), an EMCDDA delegation will meet:  Montenegrin Minister of Health, Dr Kenan Hrapović; Head of the EU Delegation in Montenegro, Ambassador Aivo Orav; and  representatives of the Prime Minister’s office, the Ministry of the Interior, the National Statistical Office and the Institute for Public Health.  After 10 years of technical cooperation with Montenegro — in the framework of EU-funded projects (IPA instrument of pre-accession) — the aim of the visit is to strengthen the agency’s links to the country in view of its possible accession to the EU. In 2018, the EMCDDA undertook an assessment of the National Drugs Observatory (NDO) and the National Early Warning System (NEWS), making a series of recommendations and identifying possible activities to be developed in future. Taking place one year after the assessment, this visit provides an opportunity to exchange views on the state of cooperation between Montenegro and the agency and to consider progress made to date (e.g. NDO, NEWS, national information system). Close attention will also be paid to needs analysis and planning in the context of  Pre-Accession Assistance provided by the EMCDDA IPA-7 project, which kicked off earlier this month. In this framework, the visit will explore the current state of data collection on the drug situation in Montenegro and the possibilities for increased cooperation and capacity building. Reflecting the EMCDDA’s twin objective of working for a healthier and more secure Europe, the visit will involve contributions from both public health and law enforcement officials, focusing on the Montenegrin drug market, drug seizures and the monitoring of new psychoactive substances.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/emcdda-director-pays-official-visit-montenegro_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0122	2019-07-17	UNK	Italy and Sweden: court decisions on low-THC cannabis products	 Italy’s highest court says low-THC cannabis cannot be sold On 30 May 2019, Italy’s highest court, the Court of Cassation, published a note of information on the legality of selling low-THC cannabis. This followed attempts to prosecute entrepreneurs who were openly selling cannabis flower and other extracts. The products were marketed in a way to avoid the attention of law enforcement by using labels such as ‘collectors item’ or ‘not for consumption’. The sellers claimed that these cannabis products contained less than 0.2 % THC (the main psychoactive chemical in cannabis) and therefore were not controlled under the narcotics law. The Italian Law 242 of 2016 states that cultivation of certain varieties of hemp plants containing less than 0.2 % THC is permitted without any licence, and the plants could be used to produce various specified products including food and cosmetics. The court’s note of information stated that ‘the marketing of Cannabis sativa L. and, in particular, of leaves, inflorescences [flowers], oil, resin, obtained from the cultivation of the aforementioned hemp variety, does not fall within the scope of application of Law 242 of 2016’, which exhaustively lists the products that may be marketed. Therefore, sale and marketing to the public of products derived from cannabis is an offence under the Italian drug control law ‘unless the products are in practice devoid of narcotic effects’ (‘privi di efficacia drogante’). It is not yet known how this last phrase will be interpreted.

Under Swedish law industrial hemp, defined as any variety of cannabis eligible for EU support, is exempt from the narcotic control laws. However, the oil contained THC (the concentration was not determined). THC and preparations containing it are covered by the narcotic control laws. The offender was charged with a minor case of possession of a controlled drug (a preparation of THC). The court ruled that, while industrial hemp is exempted from coverage, preparations made from it that contain THC are not exempted, and are therefore included in narcotic control laws.

EMCDDA_UNK_0123	2019-07-10	UNK	President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa: ‘We cannot allow the positive results of public policies to diminish the importance of the drugs issue on the political agenda’	 His Excellency the President of the Portuguese Republic, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa visited the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) today for an insight into the work of the agency and the latest trends and developments in the drug situation in Europe. This was the President’s first visit to the EMCDDA since he took office. President Rebelo de Sousa was briefed by EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel on the key findings from the European Drug Report 2019 and the Portugal Country Drug Report 2019, launched on 6 June. During the visit, the head of state met members of the agency’s 100-strong staff and learned about their ongoing projects and challenges. Dr João Goulão, Portuguese member of the EMCDDA Management Board, also attended the event. The EMCDDA provides the EU and its Member States with ‘factual, objective, reliable and comparable information’ on drugs and drug addiction and their consequences, offering an evidence base on the European drugs problem to inform policymaking and practice. As well as monitoring the drug situation today, the agency operates early-warning mechanisms to remain vigilant to, and act on, emerging threats. The President said: ‘We cannot allow the positive results of public policies over the last 20 years to diminish the importance of the drugs issue on the political agenda. Nothing is ever definitively won. EU Member States must continue to invest in knowledge and information to support effective interventions that contribute to reducing the social harms of drug use and trafficking. This effort must be achieved collectively, because only together can EU countries tackle this increasingly sophisticated problem’. Presenting the agency’s Strategy 2025, Alexis Goosdeel said: ‘The EMCDDA contributes to a healthier and more secure Europe, through better informed drug policy and action. Working with policymakers and practitioners from both the health and law enforcement domains, we provide evidence for decisions which affect European citizens, particularly those touched by drug use and trafficking. We will continue to enrich our monitoring system with novel data sources and techniques to help us keep pace with new trends and developments.’ The EMCDDA was established in 1993 in the face of an escalating drug phenomenon in Europe and the need for independent, science-based information to help Europe understand the nature of its drug problems and better respond to them. Following preliminary monitoring tasks, the agency was inaugurated in Lisbon in 1995 and, in 2020, will celebrate 25 years of monitoring. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/portuguese-head-of-state-visits-emcdda_en

EU4MD — Inception phase In 2019, the EMCDDA launched a new technical cooperation project called EU4Monitoring Drugs (EU4MD). The three-year project, funded by the European Union, will involve countries in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) area, supporting national and regional readiness to identify and respond to drug-related security and health threats.   Technical assessment visits have already been conducted to Armenia, Georgia, Palestine*, Lebanon, Moldova, and Ukraine, where a team of security and health experts met with a range of stakeholders from the Ministries of Justice, Home Affairs, Internal Affairs and Health, national and international NGOs, and other international partners, such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Key priorities were identified in consultation with the stakeholders. Priorities in addressing drug supply included the need for technical support in monitoring drug markets and supply, intelligence gathering, training law enforcement agents on new psychoactive substances, and monitoring of drug sales on the darknet. Priorities in addressing drug demand included technical capacity building on drug monitoring, particularly on drug monitoring tools such as general population surveys, wastewater analysis, trendspotter studies, needle and syringe residue analysis, and surveys on drug use in prison settings. Interest was also expressed in the adapted Universal Prevention Curriculum, and in enhancing monitoring of drug-related deaths by joining the EURO-DEN network. Proposed activities will be further discussed by the project’s national counterparts during the EU4MD Advisory Committee meeting which will take place in Brussels over the summer. Project kick-off meetings in the eastern and southern ENP regions are scheduled for the following months.  * This designation shall not be construed as recognition of a State of Palestine and is without prejudice to the individual positions of the Member States on this issue. Spotlight on partner countries: Armenia and Lebanon Mr Arman Ghazaryan from the Security Council Office of the Republic of Armenia and Ms Marie-Thérèse Matar from the Narcotics Department of the Ministry of Public Health of Lebanon — the EMCDDA’s counterparts in these countries — speak about their national drug situations, highlighting the main challenges and threats, and reflect on successful national efforts and their views on future cooperation. Armenia Mr Arman Ghazaryan from the Security Council Office of the Republic of Armenia, the EMCDDA counterpart in the country, speaks about the drug situation in Armenia, highlighting main challenges and threats, and reflecting on successful national efforts and his views on future cooperation. What are the main drug-related challenges facing Armenia? I would like to highlight three main issues. The first one is linked to the geographical location of our country which makes it increasingly attractive and convenient for trafficking illicit drugs, thus somehow solidifying the status of Armenia as a ‘transit country’. Afghan heroin is transited via the ‘Caucasian Route’ towards Europe. Moreover, methamphetamine seems to be produced in neighbouring Iran, and in recent years Armenian officials have noticed an increase in methamphetamine consignments destined for countries of Asia-Pacific. Our law enforcement agencies are also seeing indications of a new trend in cocaine smuggling where cocaine, originating from South America, mostly Brazil, goes through Armenia on its way to Turkey. The second main challenge is the emerging drug trade through the internet. The first cases of internet-based drug sales in Armenia were reported about three years ago, and were linked to a Facebook page. Our law enforcement agencies made significant efforts to close the page; this had an immediate effect on the availability of drugs at the time. However, in recent years, we have also noticed sales of drugs through social networking services and applications, such as Instagram and Telegram Messenger. Internet has facilitated the availability of drugs, especially for young people. The third aspect is the use of postal services for drug and psychotropic substance shipments, which have increased noticeably in the last years. These shipments are usually made by mail, in small quantities, and frequently involve new psychoactive substances (NPS) – all these aspects make the detection of this illegal activity difficult. What are the main drug-related threats? In Armenia, the narcological service has a register of drug users; by end of 2018 close to 7 000 persons were registered, about half of which indicated cannabis as their main used substance, followed by opioids. However, treatment providers increasingly see clients using synthetic cannabinoids, as well as pregabalin, while stimulant use seems to be limited, at least among those registered. Opioids are primarely used by injection, and this is one of our concerns, as injecting drug use is a risk factor for the spread of blood-borne infections (viral hepatitis, HIV), and may cause vascular lesions and subsequent complications. What has been done to address the challenges posed by drugs? At the national level we focus on strengthening collaboration with different law enforcement agencies.  Our Customs, Police and National Security Service have implemented a number of successful joint operations, e.g. controlled deliveries of drugs, particularly of those that are imported through mail packages. Moreover, we develop our international relationships at operational and strategic levels. Here I would like to mention the cooperation with the EMCDDA and United States Drug Enforcement Administration. A number of activities have been carried out to consolidate technical capacity on border checkpoints. The Anti-Smuggling Department of the State Revenue Committee has also established a specialised analytical division which plays a significant role in risk analysis and profiling. In terms of responses, our drug treatment services consist of four specialised local clinics. Drug treatment is available also in prison hospitals. Around 500 patients at the four clinics in the penitentiary system currently receive opioid substitution treatment. Where and how can the EU4MD project make a difference? We are looking forward to intensified cooperation with the EMCDDA. Our national priority is the development of human resources and capacity; therefore we welcome any proposal that allows our experts to participate and learn from their peers abroad, whether through training or conferences. I mentioned NPS before, and we expect to be more closely associated with the European information exchange on NPS, including their timely detection and analysis. Finally, I hope that this project can help us to further consolidate the Armenian drug monitoring system and increase available information. In this domain we would like to gain more knowledge on the use of drugs in the general population, and also focus on the improvement of data about high-risk drug use and drug-related deaths. Lebanon Ms Marie-Thérèse Matar from the Narcotics Department of the Ministry of Public Health, the EMCDDA counterpart in the country, speaks about the drug situation in Lebanon, highlighting the main challenges and threats, and reflecting on successful national efforts and her views on future cooperation. What are the main drug-related challenges facing Lebanon? The first challenge for Lebanon is to ensure good coverage, because currently there is a lack of treatment centres in some regions. We also have difficulties in reaching vulnerable populations such as women, adolescents, sex workers and men who have sex with men, and also refugees and displaced people. The problem also arises in prison where there is no specific regulation for the management of substance use. As it is, apart from a few NGOs that run programmes in prisons, there is little assistance for inmates with substance use disorders or who are exposed to substance use. For the majority of people, accessibility is not the only problem; they often also have financial issues because opioid substitution medications are not covered by the government (buprenorphine and Suboxone, for example). Another big issue in Lebanon is the lack of accreditation and evaluation for treatment centres and NGOs working on substance use. The first thing that needs to be done is to update our guidelines for opioid substitution treatment (OST), following expert advice and evidence-based research.  Finally, a new challenge for us as professionals in the field is the increase in the use of new psychoactive substances. Often called ‘salvia’, these herbal blends contain various synthetic drugs, mostly synthetic cannabinoids, which are strong and can cause serious adverse effects and intoxications. What are the main drug-related threats? Today, the main threats are the increases in drug-related mortality (overdoses and indirect related mortality), morbidity (considering all drug-related infectious diseases), although we noticed a significant decrease in the number of patients positive to Hep C following implementation of an OST programme (5.9% in 2018 vs 27% in 2011), and criminal behaviour. What has been done to address the challenges posed by drugs? For now, we are trying to improve coverage by implementing a new dispensing unit in Bekaa, soon in the north, and a new treatment centre in Byblos is already implemented. We initiated a review of OST guidelines within the task force committee. We already registered Suboxone and have organised training on overdose response in hospital emergency room units, including Naloxone administration protocols in emergency settings. Finally, we are elaborating standards for the accreditation of residential substance use rehabilitation programmes, and the implementation of prevention standards will start in 2019. Where and how can the EU4MD project make a difference? We would like to benefit from this opportunity to obtain support in reviewing and updating existing programmes and improving their outcomes. Mainly to increase the availability and accessibility of high-quality age- and gender-sensitive prevention and treatment services. It could be also an opportunity to integrate a core set of substance use treatment and rehabilitation service use indicators within the national health information system, in order to gather and centralise information on drug use, but also to evaluate our own services. Overall, we would like to establish a monitoring and auditing mechanism for treatment centres. And a last point: EU4MD could help us to organise training for professionals working in rehabilitation centres on tailored approaches for vulnerable communities, including LGBT and adolescents. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/update-eu4monitoring-drugs-project_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0125	2019-07-01	UNK	EMCDDA collaborates in international conference on drug prevention, treatment and care 	 The EMCDDA is collaborating this week in the 2019 International Conference on Drug Prevention, Treatment and Care — Inspiration and Direction, organised in Vienna by the International Society of Substance Use Prevention and Treatment Professionals (ISSUP). The event — running from 1–5 July with a packed programme of plenaries, keynotes and training workshops — brings together national and international experts in substance use prevention, treatment and care. Speaking at the opening session today, EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel presented the latest demand reduction trends and developments in Europe. Around 1.2 million people received treatment for illicit drug use in the EU in 2017. An estimated 654 000 opioid users received opioid substitution treatment (OST) in the EU, a 4% increase on the previous year. The Director also highlighted a number of EMCDDA products and services including its Health and social responses to drug problems: a European guide; Best Practice Portal and its public health priorities (preventing and treating hepatitis C and preventing overdose deaths). Over 9 000 (9 461) overdose deaths, mainly related to heroin and other opioids, are estimated to have occurred in Europe (EU 28, Turkey and Norway) in 2017, with 8 000 (8 238) in the EU only. As conference collaborator, the EMCDDA will hold a three-day workshop at the event focusing on the most useful and evidence-based prevention interventions and approaches, based on the European Universal Prevention Curriculum (EUPC). This is ahead of the launch of a EUPC manual in September. Gregor Burkhart, the agency’s principal scientific analyst in the area of prevention, will present Xchange, the EMCDDA’s online registry of evidence-based prevention programmes, and ask ‘Can registries of evidence-based programmes really make a difference?’  Professionals, academics and experts from European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) countries are participating in the conference, thanks to 15 bursaries being offered through the EU4Monitoring Drugs (EU4MD) project. The three-year EU-funded project — launched by the EMCDDA in January — supports national and regional readiness in the ENP area to identify and respond to drug-related health and security threats. The International Society of Substance Use Professionals (ISSUP) is a global non-governmental organisation that supports the development of a professional substance use prevention, treatment and recovery network.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/issup-2019_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0126	2019-06-28	UNK	Latest update on drug-related infectious diseases in Europe 	 The EMCDDA has published today its latest update on Drug-related infectious diseases in Europe for the period to February 2019. The publication provides an overview of the most recent infectious disease surveillance data, outbreak investigations and prevention and control measures among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Europe. The information presented is collected through the EMCDDA’s drug-related infectious diseases (DRID) network. Below are some of the findings ‘At a glance’. Population at risk: people who inject drugs The report describes this population at risk (PWID) in terms of the number of injectors and their main injecting practices. While evidence from drug treatment centres suggests that the prevalence of injecting drug use is declining in the European Union, Norway and Turkey, this group is at high risk of contracting blood-borne viruses and other infections. As of 2018, the estimated national prevalence of injecting drug use ranged from less than 1 per 1 000 in Cyprus, the Netherlands and Spain to more than 5 per 1 000 in Czechia, Estonia and Latvia. While heroin remains overall the most commonly injected drug in Europe, stimulants such as cocaine, amphetamines and synthetic cathinones are also injected, and predominate in some countries. The high burden of viral hepatitis The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most prevalent blood-borne virus infection among people who inject drugs, with many countries reporting the prevalence of HCV antibodies (a marker of having been infected by the virus) among this group in excess of 50 %. While the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (a marker of being currently infected) among people who inject drugs is under 5 % in most countries, it is still much higher than in the general population, despite the availability of an effective and safe vaccine. Individuals who remain chronically infected are at risk of cirrhosis and cancer, and can transmit the virus to others when sharing injecting materials that have been in contact with their blood. Overall decline in HIV cases but outbreaks linked to stimulant injecting still detected While people who inject drugs now account for a smaller proportion of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases in the European Union, Norway and Turkey (less than 5 % of all new diagnoses in 2017), HIV infections linked to injecting drug use are being diagnosed late, and local HIV outbreaks among people who inject drugs are still being documented in Europe (Germany, Lithuania and the United Kingdom). The newly documented HIV outbreak in Bavaria included in this report adds to the list of other recent HIV outbreaks linked to an increase in stimulant injection: Dublin 2014–15 (synthetic cathinones, alpha-PVP), Luxembourg 2014–17 (cocaine) and Glasgow 2015 (cocaine). Key interventions for elimination: prevention, testing and treatment Ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic and combating viral hepatitis is part of the United Nation’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Achieving this goal will require scaling-up the harm reduction services offered to people who inject drugs and access to diagnosis and effective treatment (antiretroviral therapy and direct-acting antiviral treatment). Despite the well-documented cost-effectiveness of prevention measures, such as needle and syringe programmes and opioid substitution treatment, their national coverage, as monitored by the EMCDDA, is still sub-optimal in many European countries. While available data on the HIV cascade of care for people who inject drugs are encouraging, there are still barriers both to testing and to providing this group access to direct-acting antiviral treatment for hepatitis C. The report — the most recent edition in the agency’s Rapid Communication series — ends by outlining the public health messages of the latest guidance for prison settings in the context of infectious disease prevention and control in prisons in three EU Member States.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/latest-update-on-drug-related-infectious-diseases-in-europe_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0127	2019-06-27	UNK	EMCDDA Best practice portal update	 This content was published in the Best pratice portal update briefing on 27.06.2019 Psychosocial interventions to reduce cocaine and amphetamine use Prolonged use of stimulants such as amphetamines and cocaine may result in significant mental and physical illness but, to date, there is no widely accepted treatment. Psychosocial interventions are often the first-line of action as there are no pharmacotherapies approved for its treatment. However, little is known about which interventions, if any, are more effective for the treatment of these disorders.  Further to the previous Best practice portal (BPP) newsletter, which addressed recent evidence on treatment options for amphetamine-type stimulant disorders, we found new evidence on psychosocial interventions to reduce cocaine and amphetamine use.  A recent systematic review compared the efficacy of different psychosocial interventions, alone or in combination, to reduce cocaine and amphetamine use. It found that contingency management combined with community reinforcement approaches appears to be the most efficient psychosocial intervention for the treatment of these disorders.  Contingency management is a behavioural approach that consists of rewarding individuals for evidence of positive behavioural change. When applied to the treatment of substance use disorders, contingency management provides users with rewards upon drug-free urine samples. A community reinforcement approach is a multi-layered behavioural treatment intervention to help individuals adjust their lifestyles so that healthy living becomes more rewarding and enjoyable than substance use. It involves functional analysis of substance use, coping-skills training, relapse prevention, and social, familial, recreational, and vocational reinforcements. Prescription monitoring programmes Prescription monitoring programmes (PMPs) seek to prevent the overuse and misuse of prescription drugs by compiling and monitoring data on the prescribing practices of healthcare providers and on the medications that patients receive. A recent systematic review found no significant evidence of effect of PMPs on opioid prescribing and dispensing. Further studies are needed to determine its effectiveness. Telemedicine-delivered treatment interventions  In the new round of updates to the Best practice portal, we found there were insufficient data to conclude that telemedicine-delivered treatment interventions are effective, or ineffective, in treating substance use disorders. However, studies examined in a recent systematic review suggest that this type of intervention may be an effective alternative when face-to-face treatment is less available. Other BPP updates In this new round of updates we found little or no evidence of effect for: assertive community treatment (ACT) for substance use disorders, and integrated care of infectious diseases and substance use disorders to improve infectious disease treatment outcomes. The sets of evidence in these areas remain insufficient. Nevertheless, ‘unknown effectiveness’ and ‘lack of evidence’ are significant findings that communicate a gap in knowledge and a need to stimulate further research in the field 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/best-practice-portal-update-june_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0128	2019-06-25	UNK	New EMCDDA report highlights greater diversity of cannabis products, increasing potency and the need for close monitoring of health effects 	 Cannabis products have become increasingly diverse in Europe and close monitoring of their potency and potential health effects is essential. These are among the conclusions of a new report published today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) ahead of International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking (26 June) (1). The report — Developments in the European cannabis market (2) — provides an overview of emerging and established cannabis products in Europe. Today’s report identifies a range of factors behind the current diversity of cannabis products, including policy developments, advances in production and extraction techniques and changing consumer preferences. The creation of legal recreational cannabis markets outside the EU is also noted as driving innovation in the development of new cannabis products, some of which are now appearing on the European market. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘The dynamic nature of the current cannabis market and the diversification of cannabis products available bring considerable challenges. New and more potent cannabis products may have serious public health consequences for users. Therefore, monitoring and understanding new trends in cannabis products available to European consumers today is important to inform the policy and regulatory debate.’ Cannabis remains the most widely used illicit drug in Europe. Some 17.5 million young Europeans (15–34 years) are estimated to have used cannabis in the last year (EU-28). Around 1% of adults (15–64 years) in the EU are estimated to be daily, or almost daily, cannabis users. In 2017, some 155 000 people entered drug treatment in Europe for problems related to this drug, of those around 83 000 were entering treatment for the first time. Cannabis is now the substance most often named by new entrants to specialist drug treatment services as their main reason for contact (3). Cannabis contains many different chemicals, the best known being Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) — largely responsible for the intoxicating effects of cannabis — and cannabidiol (CBD). What are the new products on the European cannabis market? Concentrates: These are made by extracting THC from the cannabis plant, often using heat and pressure or volatile solvents or gases. Advances in extraction techniques are yielding high potencies (70%–80% THC). Consuming concentrates can result in high THC exposure and potentially pose a greater risk of psychosis and dependence. Edibles: This is an umbrella term referring to foods (often sweets or liquids) containing THC and/or CBD. Adding cannabis products to foodstuffs results in slower onset and longer duration of effects than when smoking cannabis (thus dosing becomes important). Synthetic cannabinoids: These man-made chemical substances mimic the effects of cannabis but may be far more potent. Some of these are sold as ‘licit’ replacements for cannabis, however, some are now controlled internationally and/or under national legislation. The first synthetic cannabinoid detected in Europe (JWH-018) was detected in 2008 in products branded as ‘Spice’ (4). Since then, more than 180 synthetic cannabinoids have been reported to the EMCDDA. Cannabis-based medicinal and health-orientated products: These include products manufactured to pharmaceutical standards for medicinal use and others with varied composition and descriptions. The report provides a brief overview of approved cannabis-based medicinal products (an EMCDDA in-depth analysis is also available) (5). Latest developments with established cannabis products Along with the emerging products on the European cannabis market, there are also challenges arising with the more established forms of the drug. In broad terms, there are two main types of herbal cannabis on European markets: ‘sinsemilla’ or indoor-grown herbal cannabis produced within the EU, and imported herbal cannabis. In addition to herbal cannabis, plant material is also used to produce cannabis resin. Morocco is the largest producer of resin available on the European drug market. Data provided by the EU Member States show that the THC concentration of cannabis products found in Europe over the last decade has increased, raising concerns about potential harms. The estimated mean potency of herbal cannabis doubled from 5% to 10% THC from 2006 to 2016, and cannabis resin potency increased from 8% to 17% THC. Monitoring tools to capture cannabis market diversification The report underlines the need to develop monitoring tools to capture information on these products and their health effects, at national and European level (particularly on cannabis concentrates). From a harm reduction perspective, it will also be advisable to monitor the concentration of CBD in cannabis products. Finally, having the ability to distinguish illicit cannabis products from cannabis-based medicinal products and unregulated CBD oils will be important for law enforcement in many jurisdictions. Cannabis, controversies and challenges Today’s report is one of a number of EMCDDA publications and services exploring some of the complex issues in the cannabis policy field. These include analyses of the medical use of cannabis, cannabis and driving (6), and an online alert service on the status and recent developments in cannabis policy (7). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/5/developments-in-the-european-cannabis-market_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0129	2019-06-14	UNK	A year in review: EMCDDA publishes its latest General Report of Activities	 An external evaluation of the EMCDDA, new products and services, and support to policy and practice in the fields of health and security are among the features presented in the latest General Report of Activities published today by the agency. The report, covering key achievements and governance in 2018, presents the implementation of the EMCDDA work programme activities over the 12-month period. The year 2018 was one in which the value that the agency brings to its stakeholders and key partners was further confirmed. An external evaluation of the EMCDDA, carried out by the European Commission (EC) and presented to the EMCDDA Management Board in December 2018, concluded that the agency is performing very well, delivers excellent outputs and has a high reputation at both European and international levels. The agency will closely follow up on the recommendations of the evaluation to guide its future activities and remain policy relevant and structurally fit to respond to stakeholder needs. The most tangible results of the agency’s work are its publications. In 2018, 45 scientific and corporate publications, in addition to 30 Country Drug Reports, were released, including seven joint publications produced with EU agencies or international organisations. The EMCDDA’s annual overview of the drug situation, in the form of its flagship European Drug Report, was launched in Brussels in June by European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, Dimitris Avramopoulos and by EMCDDA Director, Alexis Goosdeel. Policy and practice relevance were at the core of the agency’s work throughout the year. The EMCDDA provided services to its three main customer groups: EU institutions; national policymakers in the EU Member States; and professionals working in the drugs field. Here it contributed to major EU drug policy documents, through technical support to EU institutions, and, overall, contributed to around 300 drug-related scientific, policy and practice events. The agency disseminated best practice, held training sessions and undertook capacity-building activities to share knowledge in 2018. Its cannabis policy news service continued to provide regular alerts to its policy audience and its audience doubled in 2018. A three-year initiative with the purpose of promoting hepatitis C testing among people who inject drugs (PWID) in drug treatment settings was launched mid-year. This reflected an operationalisation of a central EMCDDA public health priority, as defined in the agency’s Strategy 2025. The agency’s role in coordinating the EU Early Warning System (EU EWS) on new psychoactive substances was also strengthened in 2018 as a result of the application (on 23 November) of a new legal framework. This framework provides the EMCDDA with increased responsibilities and new formal partnerships with other EU agencies, and it amends its Founding Regulation (recast). The EWS was formally notified for the first time of 55 NPS during the year, bringing the total number of NPS currently monitored to around 730. The EU Member States are among the agency’s core partners, particularly the Reitox national focal points (NFPs), its main data providers. 2018 was the first year of implementation of the Reitox Development Framework, adopted by the heads of the NFPs in 2017, and much of the agency’s efforts were focused on supporting the NFPs in this endeavour. Finally, a key development in working with partners was the signing of a grant agreement between the EC and the EMCDDA to implement, from January 2019, a new technical cooperation project for European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries. Entitled ‘EU4 Monitoring Drugs’, this will be the largest technical cooperation project carried out so far by the agency. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/emcdda-publishes-general-report-of-activities-2019_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0130	2019-06-06	UNK	Cocaine seizures at record levels in a competitive drug market	 Europe is seeing signs of an increase in cocaine availability, with seizures of the drug at record levels. This is according to the European Drug Report 2019: Trends and Developments, released by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) today in Brussels (1). In its annual overview, the agency also explores: the challenges associated with heroin and new synthetic opioids, the latest developments in the cannabis market, Europe’s growing role in synthetic drug production and the use of digital technologies for health benefits in the drugs field. Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, says: ‘Today’s report shows the complex nature of Europe’s drug phenomenon. Drugs remain a constantly evolving, multi-faceted threat to our societies, affecting the life of millions of citizens around the world. We need a more coordinated approach that tackles both supply and demand. Our efforts are bearing fruit with our new rules to ban psychoactive substances and our enhanced cooperation with international partners. But we also need to look at the role of digitalisation in the drug market. We have no time to spare. We need to be coordinated at the national, European and international levels. Together with our EU drugs agency, we will continue to play a leading role in this effort.’ The EMCDDA report highlights the continuing high availability of most illicit substances. The latest data show that in Europe (EU-28, Turkey and Norway), over 1 million seizures of illicit drugs are reported annually. Around 96 million adults in the EU (15–64 years) have tried an illicit drug in their lifetime and an estimated 1.2 million people receive treatment each year for illicit drug use (EU-28). In 2018, 55 new psychoactive substances (NPS) were detected in the EU for the first time, bringing the total number monitored by the agency to 730. Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘The challenges we face in the drugs area continue to grow. Not only are there signs of increased availability of established plant-based drugs like cocaine, but we are also witnessing an evolving market where synthetic drugs and drug production within Europe are growing in importance. This can be seen in problems associated with the use of highly potent synthetic opioids, in new production techniques for MDMA and amphetamines, and in recent developments in the processing of morphine into heroin inside Europe’s borders’. Cocaine: record seizures, new distribution methods and evidence of growing health problems Figure 1.6  Infographic, p. 26  Latest data on cocaine show that both the number of seizures and quantities of cocaine seized are at record levels. Over 104 000 cocaine seizures were reported in the EU in 2017 (98 000 in 2016), amounting to 140.4 tonnes, around double the quantity seized in 2016 (70.9 tonnes) (Figure 1.6). Although the retail price of cocaine remained stable, its purity at street level reached its highest level in a decade in 2017 (Infographic, p. 26). Cocaine enters Europe through numerous routes and means, but the growth in large-volume trafficking, using maritime shipping containers, stands out as a major challenge. There is evidence that the use of social media, darknet marketplaces and encryption techniques are playing an increasing role in enabling smaller groups and individuals to engage in drug dealing. Looking at the cocaine market, entrepreneurship can be seen in innovative distribution methods. One example is the existence of cocaine ‘call centres’, with couriers providing fast and flexible delivery. Such methods — reflecting a potential ‘uberisation’ of the cocaine trade (2) — are indicative of a competitive market in which sellers compete by offering additional services beyond the product itself. Figure 2.4  Cocaine is the most commonly used illicit stimulant drug in the EU, with around 2.6 million young adults (15–34 years) having used it in the last year (2017 estimate). A recent study of drug residues in municipal wastewater revealed that, between 2017 and 2018, there were increases in cocaine metabolites in 22 of the 38 cities with data for this period, confirming the upward trend also reported in 2017. In 2018, the highest residues standardised per 1 000 people per day were recorded in cities in Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands, and the UK. In some cities in Eastern Europe, recent data show an increase, albeit from a low level (see Figure 2.4). Figure 3.8   There are signs that the increase in cocaine supply is associated with more reported health problems. The latest estimates show that around 73 000 clients now enter specialised drug treatment for cocaine-related problems. Of particular concern are the 11 000 of these who entered treatment for crack cocaine-related problems, a particularly damaging form of cocaine consumption. The number of ‘new’ clients reported as requiring treatment for a cocaine problem for the first time rose by 37% between 2014 and 2017, suggesting treatment needs are growing. Cocaine was also the illicit drug most commonly reported in drug-related hospital emergency presentations recorded by a network of 26 sentinel hospitals in 18 European countries in 2017 (Euro-DEN Plus) (Figure 3.8). Heroin: indications of market changes Table 1.2  Infographic, p. 24  Heroin is still the most common illicit opioid on the drug market in Europe and is a major contributor to drug-related health and social costs. The quantity of heroin seized in the EU increased by over a tonne in 2017 to 5.4 tonnes, with an additional 17.4 tonnes seized by Turkey (some of which would have been destined for the EU market). A worrying development is the 81 tonnes of the heroin precursor chemical acetic anhydride seized in the EU in 2017 and the 243 tonnes of it in stopped shipments (Table 1.2). Additionally, laboratories producing heroin from morphine using this precursor have been discovered in recent years in EU countries (Bulgaria, Czechia, Spain and the Netherlands). Heroin purity remains high and the retail price relatively low (having fallen over the last decade) (Infographic, p. 24). Europe aims to combat viral hepatitis as a public health threat in line with the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Providing people who inject heroin, or other drugs, with greater access to prevention, testing and treatment for HBV and HCV is central to achieving this objective, as they are the people with the highest burden of disease and at highest risk of transmission. The EMCDDA report highlights the need to scale up measures to address viral hepatitis, particularly in parts of Eastern Europe. New synthetic opioids: a growing concern The current opioid epidemic in the United States and Canada is largely driven by the use of synthetic opioids, particularly fentanyl and its derivatives. While these substances currently represent only a small share of the drug market in Europe, they are a growing concern, with use linked to poisonings and deaths. Eleven new synthetic opioids were detected in Europe in 2018, usually in the form of powders, tablets and liquids. With only very small volumes needed to produce many thousands of street doses, these substances are easy to conceal and transport, representing a challenge for law enforcement and customs. Figure 1.12  Fentanyl derivatives make up the majority of the 49 new synthetic opioids monitored by the EMCDDA. Six fentanyl derivatives were detected in Europe for the first time in 2018 (34 detected since 2009). In the most recent data, these highly potent drugs accounted for 70% of all seizures of the new synthetic opioids (Figure 1.12). Over 300 seizures of carfentanil were reported, one of the most potent drugs in this family. A total of 4.5 kg of a precursor chemical for the manufacture of fentanyl derivatives (N-phenethyl-4-piperidone) was also seized in the EU (Table 1.2). Figure 2.13  Data from drug treatment monitoring shows that one in every five clients (22%) entering drug treatment for an opioid-related problem now reports a licit or illicit synthetic opioid, rather than heroin, as their main problem drug (Figure 2.13). This indicates that opioid-containing medicines are also now playing an increasingly important role in the European drugs problem. Cannabis: new developments for Europe’s most established drug Cannabis remains the most widely used illicit drug in Europe, as evident in data on prevalence, seizures and new treatment demands. Some 17.5 million young Europeans (15–34 years) are estimated to have used cannabis in the last year (EU-28 — 2017 estimate). In 2017, EU Member States reported 782 000 seizures of cannabis products (herb, resin, plants and oil), making it Europe’s most-seized drug. The quantity of cannabis resin seized is more than double that of herbal cannabis (466 versus 209 tonnes). A recent EMCDDA study (3) found that herbal cannabis and resin had doubled in typical tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (4) content over the last decade, raising concerns about potential harms. In the case of resin, the drivers of increasing average potency are likely to include the introduction of high-potency plants and new production techniques in Morocco, the main producer of resin for the EU market. Infographic, p. 44  Around 1% of adults (15–64 years) in the EU are estimated to be daily, or almost daily, cannabis users. In 2017, some 155 000 people entered drug treatment in Europe for problems related to this drug, of those around 83 000 were entering treatment for the first time (Infographic, p. 44). Cannabis is now the substance most often named by new entrants to specialist drug treatment services as their main reason for contact. Cannabis: new products add to challenges in a complex policy area The creation of legal recreational cannabis markets outside the EU is driving innovation in product development (e.g. e-liquids, edible products and concentrates), some of which are now appearing on the European market where they pose a new challenge for drug detection and control. Cannabis contains many different chemicals, the best known being tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). One example of rapid developments in the cannabis market is the appearance of low-THC products sold in specialist or health food shops in some EU countries (5). Sales take place on the claim that these products have less than 0.2% or 0.3% THC, and therefore have little, or no, intoxicating effects, and do not fall under existing drug control laws. The CBD content of the products is sometimes highlighted, with claims that this substance may have beneficial qualities. A range of products is now available including plants, smoking mixtures, pills, lotions and creams. These raise regulatory issues, with some countries subjecting sales of low-THC products to criminal penalties, and others allowing them to be traded without a licence. Europe’s growing role in synthetic drug production Synthetic drug production in Europe appears to be ‘growing, diversifying and becoming more innovative’, states the report. New substances are being used to make the chemicals needed to produce synthetic drugs. This aims to avoid detection, but also involves more complex processing (that can create additional hazardous waste). This is reflected in an increase in the seizures of alternative precursors, for both MDMA and amphetamine and methamphetamine, with seizures of APAA and glycidic derivatives of PMK both increasing in the most recent data (Table 1.2). In 2017, 21 MDMA laboratories were dismantled in the EU, up from 11 in 2016, all in the Netherlands. Dumping of chemical waste was reported in Belgium, suggesting MDMA production occurred. The latest data show that MDMA content in ‘ecstasy’ tablets reached a 10-year high in 2017. The EMCDDA reports an estimated 6.6 million MDMA tablets were seized in the EU in 2017, the highest number since 2007. Monitoring of open source information and darknet activity indicates that Europe plays an important role in the global supply of MDMA. This is also suggested by seizures in EU neighbouring countries. Turkey seized more MDMA tablets (8.6 million) and more amphetamine (6.6 tonnes) than all the EU Member States combined that year. Furthermore, it seized an exceptionally large volume (658 kg) of methamphetamine, close to the total seized in the EU (662 kg). Figure 2.11  Figure 2.10  The purity of methamphetamine and amphetamine is higher than a decade ago, with 0.7 tonnes of methamphetamine and 6.4 tonnes of amphetamine seized in the EU in 2017. Methamphetamine production is concentrated in Czechia and the border areas of neighbouring countries, with some production also taking place in the Netherlands. Wastewater and other data suggest that methamphetamine use, generally low and historically concentrated in Czechia and Slovakia, now appears to be present also in Cyprus, the east of Germany, Spain, Finland and Norway (Figure 2.11). As regards amphetamine, in cities with wastewater data for 2017 and 2018, 21 out of 38 cities reported an increase in amphetamine detections (Figure 2.10). M-health: geo-location and virtual reality, new tools in responding to drug problems The widespread use of mobile devices today means that m-health ‘apps’ (mobile health applications) have a vast potential to expand the reach of drug-related health services. According to the report, novel digital solutions of this kind are increasingly being used in drug prevention, treatment and harm reduction. Figure 3.2  The report presents a range of m-health apps with different primary aims — from disseminating information (e.g. access to services) to supporting interventions (e.g. drug-use diaries) and recovery (e.g. self-help apps) (Figure 3.2). One innovative example is the use of geo-location to help people who inject drugs find needle- and syringe-exchange points. Also under analysis is the use of virtual reality technology (headsets) to recreate immersive drug-related environments that induce cravings and help patients develop resilience. A large number of m-health apps developed in Europe focus on disseminating harm reduction information aimed at young users, especially partygoers. Although there are now many m-health apps available, a recent EMCDDA study found that they are not always accompanied by robust quality standards, data protection rules and evaluation (6). --- Chair of the EMCDDA Management Board Laura d’Arrigo concludes: ‘The European Drug Report 2019 arrives at a critical time for reflection on drug policy developments as next year will see the final evaluation of the EU drugs strategy (2013–20). Over this period, Europe has faced some dramatic changes in the drug phenomenon, including the appearance of scores of non-controlled substances. The understanding of current drug problems allows us to prepare for future challenges in this fast-changing and complex area. This is why the role played by the EMCDDA in providing evidence-based analyses of Europe’s drug situation today is so crucial’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/4/european-drug-report-2019-highlights_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0131	2019-05-29	UNK	New city study results published on drugs in syringes 	 A new EMCDDA Rapid Communication, published on 29 May, presents the results of an innovative project to gather information on the substances used by people who inject drugs, by chemically analysing the residual content of used syringes. The pilot study of the ESCAPE project (European Syringe Collection and Analysis Project Enterprise) collected syringes in 2017 from the bins of street automatic injection kit dispensers and at harm-reduction services in a network of six sentinel European cities: Amsterdam, Budapest, Glasgow, Helsinki, Lausanne and Paris. The contents of 1 521 used syringes were analysed in five laboratories using chromatographic and spectroscopic methods.Among the findings were that traces of stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines and synthetic cathinones) were found in a high proportion of the syringes tested in each of the cities, which may indicate a high prevalence of stimulant use among people who inject drugs. The project seeks to complement existing data on substances injected by users, by providinglocal and timely information that can be used for city-level monitoring and interventions. It complements existing monitoring tools (such as surveillance data from drug treatment centres) but does not replace them. Well-designed observational studies, collecting behavioural data and qualitative information from interviews with drug users in low-threshold services or using respondent driven sampling, are still the best tools to obtain information on many aspects of injecting, including reuse and sharing. Nevertheless, the timely, laboratory-confirmed local data on injected substances and patterns of injection provided by the ESCAPE approach can help to guide local responses. By collecting injecting material from street bins, it potentially provides information on groups of people who inject drugs that are not reached by health services. Future collection campaigns will further harmonise the sampling strategy, the type of syringes collected and the list of substances tested across cities. Future campaigns should also aim at collecting syringes from other settings and including more cities in order to provide a more representative picture of the European situation and to advance knowledge on local injecting practices. By analysing trends over time, the network will aim to detect changing patterns of injecting.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/new-city-study-results-published-drugs-syringes_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0135	2019-03-25	UNK	WHO recommends rescheduling of cannabis	 This news item was published in the EMCDDA’s Cannabis drug policy news on 25.03.2019 On 24 January 2019, the Director General of the World Health Organization sent a letter to the Secretary General of the United Nations recommending, among other things, that cannabis and associated substances be rescheduled in the international drug control framework. The changes are reported to facilitate the trade of these substances for medicinal and scientific purposes. How are drugs classified? How are drugs classified? The UN Conventions of 1961 and 1971 each list substances in four schedules, which determine their controls for international trade. The schedules group substances according to their therapeutic value and risk to public health. The WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD), an independent group of experts, may examine the evidence available for such substances and recommend their positions within these schedules. The UN’s Commission on Narcotic Drugs should then vote on whether to accept the recommendation. Where does cannabis fit? In the 1961 Convention, substances are listed in either Schedule I or Schedule II according to their liability of abuse and production of ill effects. Substances may also be listed in Schedule III if available in a medical preparation, or Schedule IV if particularly harmful and with few therapeutic properties. ‘Extracts and tinctures of cannabis’ are listed in Schedule I. ‘Cannabis and cannabis resin’, however, are listed in both Schedules I and IV; the inclusion in Schedule IV makes them very difficult to trade for medicinal purposes. In the 1971 Convention, substances are listed in Schedules I-IV, on broadly inverse scales of ‘risk to public health’ and ‘therapeutic usefulness’. Currently, ‘tetrahydrocannabinol’ (THC) is classified in Schedule I (especially serious risk to public health and limited if any therapeutic usefulness), while ‘delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol’ is classified in Schedule II (substantial risk to public health and little to moderate therapeutic usefulness). The trading restrictions are different for each Schedule but they are also slightly different for each Convention. THC is therefore subject to different trading restrictions from the plant material in which it naturally occurs. What does the WHO-ECDD recommend? Cannabis and cannabis resin: remove from Schedule IV (keep in Schedule I) as it is not ‘particularly harmful’ (for example: use is not associated with a significant risk of death). ‘Extracts and tinctures’: remove from the Conventions as it is a complicated term to interpret, covering preparations that have psychoactive properties as well as those that do not. Effectively this will be replaced by a new entry in Schedule III of the 1961 Convention referring to pharmaceutical preparations of cannabis that do not pose a risk to public health. Delta-9-THC/dronabinol: delete from the 1971 Convention Schedule II and move to the 1961 Convention, Schedule I (with cannabis and cannabis resin). Previously considered a pharmaceutical preparation, it primarily refers to the main psychoactive component of cannabis. This will be a similar approach as for coca leaf/cocaine and opium/morphine. THC isomers: delete from the 1971 Convention Schedule I and move to the 1961 Convention Schedule I, based on current knowledge. Cannabidiol (CBD): add a footnote that products containing predominantly CBD and not more than 0.2% Delta-9-THC are not under international control. They are explicitly excluded as there is no relevant risk to public health. These proposals were to be voted on by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs at its March 2019 session, but the vote was postponed as the recommendations were delayed. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/who-recommends-rescheduling-of-cannabis_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0136	2019-03-18	UNK	EMCDDA Best practice portal update	 This content was published in the Best pratice portal update briefing on 18.03.2019 Treatment for amphetamine-type stimulants use disorders The use of amphetamines, methamphetamines and other amphetamine-type stimulants (like MDMA) is widespread globally. Their prolonged use may result in severe mental and physical symptoms but, to date, there is no widely accepted treatment. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is often the preferred choice because its effectiveness in the treatment of other substance use disorders has been established, and there are no associated adverse effects. However, little is known about CBT in the treatment of amphetamine-type stimulants use disorders. A recent review has sought to address this gap; it found there were insufficient data to conclude that CBT is effective, or ineffective, in treating amphetamine-type stimulants use disorders. Several pharmacotherapies have also been tested, though none is presently approved for the treatment of these disorders. A recent systematic review addressing pharmacotherapy for amphetamine and methamphetamine use disorders found no evidence of effectiveness of any class of drug in increasing abstinence, reducing use, or improving treatment outcomes. There was, however, some indication that methylphenidate and topiramate may be useful in reducing methamphetamine use, but more research is needed. These reviews are important, as unknown effectiveness and lack of evidence are significant findings that may stimulate further research by communicating a gap in knowledge and detailing the importance of addressing it. Scare tactics Scare tactics and fear-based messages were widely used in substance use prevention until evidence found them to be ineffective or harmful. However, a recent review, found that current fear-based messages may be useful in preventing substance use. The fear-based messages it analysed differed significantly in tone and content from similar ones from the past: they focused on specific substances, avoided moralising, and did not communicate a direct command telling individuals what to do. More evidence is needed to assess their effectiveness accurately. Effects of OST in prison on post-release behaviours In the new round of updates to the Best practice portal, we found that opioid substitution treatment with methadone provided during incarceration is effective in increasing community treatment engagement and in reducing post-release illicit opioid use and injection drug use. No effects were found in reducing relapse into criminal behaviour. Other BPP updates In this new round of updates we found little or no evidence of the effect of: neurostimulation techniques to prevent surgery-induced opioid dependence; substance use treatment interventions in group settings; and psychosocial interventions to reduce alcohol among people who use illicit drugs. The sets of evidence in these areas remain insufficient and, here also, more research is needed. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/best-practice-portal-update_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0137	2019-03-14	UNK	Latest wastewater data reveal drug-taking habits in over 70 European cities and an increase in the detection of stimulants 	 The latest findings from the largest European project in the emerging science of wastewater analysis are presented today by the Europe-wide SCORE group, in association with the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). The project analysed wastewater in 73 European cities in 20 European countries in March 2018 to explore the drug-taking behaviours of their inhabitants. The 2018 study points to an increase in the detection of amphetamine, cocaine and MDMA in wastewater samples, compared to the 2017 figures. From Lisbon to Athens and from Copenhagen to Madrid, the study analysed daily wastewater samples in the catchment areas of wastewater treatment plants over a one-week period. Wastewater from approximately 46 million people was analysed for traces of four illicit drugs: amphetamine, cocaine, MDMA (ecstasy) and methamphetamine. Wastewater based epidemiology is a rapidly developing scientific discipline with the potential for monitoring close to real-time, population-level trends in illicit drug use. By sampling a known source of wastewater, such as a sewage influent to a wastewater treatment plant, scientists can now estimate the quantity of drugs used in a community by measuring the levels of illicit drugs and their metabolites excreted in urine (see motion graphic for method). The SCORE group has been conducting annual wastewater monitoring campaigns since 2011. A total of 33 cities have participated in five or more of the eight campaigns run so far, which allows for time-trend analysis of drug consumption based on wastewater testing. The 2018 results are released today in ‘Wastewater analysis and drugs — a European multi-city study’, an updated edition in the EMCDDA Perspectives on Drugs (POD) series. The POD includes an innovative interactive map and a chart-based tool allowing the user to look at geographical and temporal patterns and to zoom in on results per city and per drug. New resources available this year include ‘Frequently asked questions’ (FAQs) on wastewater-based epidemiology as well as a motion graphic aimed at those interested in setting up wastewater monitoring activities. 2018 findings: what’s new? The 2018 findings offer a valuable snapshot of drug use patterns in the cities involved, revealing marked geographical and temporal variations: Cocaine: In cities with wastewater data for 2017 and 2018, the latest figures reveal increases in traces of cocaine, confirming the upward trend reported in 2017. Cocaine residues in wastewater were highest in western and southern European cities, particularly in cities in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK. The analysis points to very low levels of cocaine use in the majority of eastern European cities, but the most recent data show signs of increases. Amphetamine: The most recent data show that most cities reported an increase in amphetamine residues, while data from the previous seven monitoring campaigns showed no major changes in patterns observed. The loads of amphetamine detected in wastewater varied considerably across the study locations, with the highest levels reported in cities in the north and east of Europe. Amphetamine was found at much lower levels in cities in the south of Europe. MDMA: The 2018 data point to increased traces of MDMA in most cities, compared with a stabilising trend in 2017. (Sharp increases of MDMA had been observed in the period 2011–16). Methamphetamine: Traditionally concentrated in Czechia and Slovakia, methamphetamine now appears to be present in Cyprus, the east of Germany, Spain and northern Europe (e.g. Finland and Norway). Weekly patterns: When weekly patterns of drug use were examined, cocaine and MDMA (ecstasy) levels rose sharply at weekends in most cities. Noteworthy in 2018, is that a similar pattern was observed for amphetamine (suggesting recreational use), whereas, previously, traces appeared to be more evenly distributed throughout the week. Methamphetamine loads were found to be evenly distributed over the week. In this project, SCORE uses a standard protocol and a common quality-control exercise in all locations, making it possible to directly compare illicit drug loads in Europe over a one-week period over eight consecutive years. The EMCDDA adopts a multi-indicator approach to drug monitoring on the principle that no single measure can provide a full picture of the drug situation. It views wastewater analysis as a valuable additional tool in its epidemiological toolkit and one which can provide timely information on a wide spectrum of substances. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/2/latest-wastewater-data-reveal-drug-taking-habits-european-cities_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0138	2019-03-13	UNK	EU drugs agency and the Republic of Albania strengthen their cooperation	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and Albania will cooperate more actively on monitoring the drug phenomenon in future, thanks to a Working Arrangement being concluded today in Vienna (1). The agreement is being signed by EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel and by the Albanian Deputy Minister of the Interior Besfort Lamallari and Deputy Minister of Health and Social Protection Mira Rakacolli in the presence of Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner responsible for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship. The signing ceremony takes place at the Delegation of the European Union to the International Organisations in Vienna and is hosted by EU Ambassador Didier Lenoir. The Working Arrangement originates in a request from the Albanian Ministry of the Interior to the EMCDDA Director in 2017 and follows the seal of approval of the European Commission and EMCDDA Management Board. While the agency has signed similar agreements with other third countries, this is the first request of its kind from the Western Balkans. The new agreement provides for the exchange of expertise between the entities concerned and will contribute to developing drug data-collection and reporting capacity in the country. The EMCDDA began its cooperation with Albania in 2007 in the framework of EU-funded technical assistance projects designed to prepare Western Balkan countries for accession to the EU (and for participation in the work of the EMCDDA and its Reitox network) (2). The EMCDDA and Albania are currently working together to consolidate Albania’s capacity to monitor the drug phenomenon through the use of evidence-based tools and knowledge built and promoted within the EU. They also exchange data on new psychoactive substances as well as expertise on establishing a national early-warning system. While no formal national drug observatory has yet been established in Albania, along the lines of a Reitox national focal point, the EMCDDA has developed close working relations with the Ministry of the Interior and with the Institute of Public Health of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection. This cooperation led to the financing of the first national general population survey on drugs in Albania in 2014 as well as the production of a Country Drug Report for Albania in 2017 following EMCDDA guidelines. Albania is one of six candidate and potential candidate countries to the EU currently receiving assistance under the EMCDDA IPA 6 project, which kicked off in July 2017 and will run until June 2019. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/1/emcdda-and-republic-albania-strengthen-their-cooperation_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0140	2019-03-08	UNK	International Women’s Day 2019 — Why gender matters in drug addiction	 Around 37 million women in Europe have used an illicit drug at least once in their lifetime. Some 100 000 enter drug treatment every year and nearly 2 000 die from drug overdose. Meanwhile, over the last decade, the gender gap has been narrowing among young school students who use drugs. Today, to commemorate International Women’s Day, the EMCDDA releases a new motion graphic exploring ‘Why gender matters in drug addiction’. Women represent only a fifth of clients in specialised drug treatment, but their problems are often more complex than for men. They tend to progress faster towards addiction, a phenomenon known as ‘telescoping’. They also go through more severe withdrawal symptoms and report higher levels of depression and anxiety. Services for women with drug use problems need to address these unique concerns and be welcoming, non-judgemental, supportive and physically and emotionally safe. A wide variety of resources on women and drug use in Europe is available today on an EMCDDA topics page: ‘Women and gender issues related to drugs’. This includes: publications, data, news and events, as well as reports from the agency’s Document Library. Also showcased are tools and resources from the Best Practice Portal and photos, infographics and videos from the Media Library. The theme for International Women’s Day 2019 is ‘Think equal, build smart, innovate for change’. The initiative focuses on innovative ways to advance gender equality and the empowerment of women, particularly in the areas of social protection systems, access to public services and sustainable infrastructure. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/international-womens-day-why-gender-matters-in-drug-addiction_en

The EMCDDA and ECDC have recently signed an updated working arrangement (December 2018) in the context of new legislation which strengthens Europe’s response to public health and social threats caused by new psychoactive substances (NPS). Having previously worked together in areas relating to data collection, knowledge exchange and sharing of best practice in the monitoring of infections associated with injecting drug use, the two agencies will now also be sharing information and data relating to NPS, their use and potential public health and social risks. The meeting today will address strategies, achievements and challenges and joint cooperation. Discussions will focus on: HCV elimination; joint country missions; EU Early Warning System on NPS; cooperation with non-EU countries; and upcoming events (e.g. Lisbon Addictions 2019 and ESCAIDE). The meeting will also be attended by Dr Maarit Kokki, ECDC Head of sector for international relations and by EMCDDA staff members working in the areas of public health, risks to public safety and security, policy coordination and international cooperation. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/ecdc-director-visits-emcdda_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0142	2019-02-22	UNK	Xchange — 16 new programmes added to online registry of evidence-based prevention programmes	 The EMCDDA has added 16 new programmes to Xchange, its online registry of evidence-based prevention programmes. Launched in October 2017, and now ending its pilot phase, the registry showcases interventions that European evaluation studies demonstrate to have promising outcomes relating to substance use. Five of the new programmes focus on substance use prevention and 11 on crime and delinquency prevention. At present, Xchange contains 38 programmes. In addition to providing information on the effectiveness of programmes, the registry — available on the EMCDDA Best practice portal— also offers information on the experiences of professionals who have implemented these programmes in individual European countries. This enables decision-makers to assess the ease with which programmes can be implemented in different social, cultural and organisational contexts. It also helps prevention professionals to learn and interact with each other about their experiences with these programmes. Even when effective programmes are used, they are not always implemented with quality and fidelity in real-life settings, often because they do not fit into the existing prevention culture and infrastructure. Xchange provides decisional support by continuously compiling information on implementation experiences with the programmes contained within it. The registry is the centre piece of a growing network of national registries. Through Xchange, an interested visitor can access additional details on a specific programme in the national language within a local registry, or access through a national registry the European implementation experiences of a given programme. A unique feature of Xchange is that it allows national high-ranking programmes to be promoted in this European registry and, inversely, allows international visitors to find more details about local adaptations in national languages. The Council of the European Union’s Minimum quality standards in drug demand reduction in the EU demands that prevention professionals have access to knowledge on effective prevention programmes. A growing number of programmes are considered effective at reducing substance use and related problems under carefully controlled conditions. However, access to evidence‐based prevention programmes is still limited and they remain under‐utilised compared to prevention strategies with no empirical evidence for effectiveness. Xchange aims to address this challenge by providing access to such programmes. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/new-programmes-added-to-online-registry-evidence-based-prevention-programmes_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0143	2019-02-21	UNK	EMCDDA intensifies its cooperation with the European Neighbourhood Policy countries 	 This year, the EMCDDA has launched a three-year project — EU4Monitoring Drugs (EU4MD) — which will intensify its cooperation with the countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP)(1)(2). The EU-funded project, running until the end of 2021, will support national and regional readiness in the ENP area to identify and respond to drug-related health and security threats. EU4MD aims to make a difference in a number of areas, including: preparedness: helping ENP beneficiary countries be better prepared to respond to existing and future drug-related threats through capacity building and strengthening partnerships; threat assessment: facilitating the identification, understanding and reporting of new and emerging drug-related threats and the analysis of their implications for security and health; and strategic understanding: supporting the strategic analysis of developments in the drug market and how these impact on security and health. Networking and partnership are central to EU4MD. Through a participatory approach and ‘learning-by-doing’, the project will help develop practical and scientific knowledge in the countries concerned and boost the skills of professionals and organisations. Project activities on the supply side of the drugs problem will include: capacity development for forensic analysis; assessment of the environmental impact of drug production; mapping of production and trafficking dynamics; and technological innovation. On the demand side, work will include: identifying trends in prevalence and patterns of drug use; supporting treatment, harm reduction and prevention; and disseminating innovative monitoring approaches. EU4MD will help implement key objectives of the EU Drugs Strategy (2013–20) by strengthening dialogue and cooperation between the EU and third countries on drug issues. It will also improve the understanding of drug use and drug problems in order to provide a sound and comprehensive evidence base to inform policies and actions. Over the last decade, the EMCDDA has been working with the ENP area and has already drawn up Memoranda of Understanding with Armenia, Georgia, Israel, Moldova and Ukraine. Field visit of police officers from Mediterranean countries In the context of EU4MD, the EMCDDA welcomes today some 30 police officers from Mediterranean countries for a field visit to its premises. This will include a presentation of the agency’s activities, with a particular focus on work in the field of markets, crime and supply reduction. The police delegation is in Lisbon this week for a ‘Euromed Police Exchange on Drug Trafficking’, hosted by the Portuguese Judiciary Police. The EU-funded Euromed Police project aims to increase citizen safety across the Euro-Mediterranean area through the strengthening of cooperation on security issues (3). The visit will lay the foundations for future cooperation and partnership in the area. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/emcdda-intensifies-cooperation-with-european-neighbourhood-countries-eu4md_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0144	2019-02-12	UNK	EMCDDA signs two new working arrangements with ECHA and EFSA	 Two new working arrangements will be signed in Brussels today between the EMCDDA and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The EMCDDA will now be cooperating with five EU agencies under new legislation applying from 23 November 2018, which strengthens the EU Early Warning System on new psychoactive substances (1). Three existing working arrangements with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC); the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Europol were updated and signed in December 2018 (2). EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel will be signing the working arrangements with ECHA Executive Director Bjorn Hansen and EFSA Executive Director Bernhard Url. The agreements will ensure that the agencies exchange information on new psychoactive substances, in accordance with their respective mandates. ECHA has the mandate to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment, including the promotion of alternative methods for assessment of hazards of substances, as well as the free circulation of substances on the internal market while enhancing competitiveness and innovation. The purpose of EFSA is to contribute to a high level of protection of human life and health and to take account of animal health and welfare, plant health and the environment, in the context of the internal market. The new arrangements will align the agencies’ working relationships with the new legislation, which allows Europe to rapidly respond to public health and social threats caused by new psychoactive substances. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/EMCDDA-signs-two-new-working-arrangements-with-ECHA-and-EFSA_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0145	2019-01-09	UNK	Gold medal for the EMCDDA for the ‘extraordinary relevance’ of its work	 The EMCDDA has been awarded a Gold Medal of the Order of Merit of the Spanish national plan on drugs (Delegación del Gobierno para el Plan Nacional sobre Drogas/DGPNSD) in recognition of, and appreciation for, its work over the past 20 years. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel is in Madrid today to receive the medal on behalf of the agency. The agency was informed of the honour by the Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality, following publication of the notice in the official state bulletin. In the communication, the EMCDDA is praised for the ‘extraordinary relevance’ of its work and its contribution to the adoption of national and EU-level policies based on evidence and scientific knowledge. Following a presentation by the new Delegate of the DGPNSD, Azucena Martí Palacios, Mr Goosdeel will speak at the Spanish Reitox focal point on ‘New challenges in the area of drugs in Europe’. He will then proceed to the Ministry for Health, Consumer Affairs and Social Welfare to receive the medal from Minister María Luisa Carcedo. The latest Country Drug Report for Spain, is published today in Spanish. (It was released in English in June 2018). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/gold-medal-for-the-emcdda_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0146	2019-01-03	UNK	Cannabis control and the right to privacy	 In 2018 the highest courts in countries across three continents have asserted that state intervention in the private life of their citizens who wish to (grow and) use cannabis is not always justified. Georgia In Georgia, on 30 July, the Constitutional Court decided that punishment of use of cannabis in private without a doctor’s prescription was in breach of Article 12 of the Constitution, which states ‘Everyone has the right to the free development of their personality’. The court found that the aims of protecting public health or public security could not justify state punishment of cannabis use in private. Penalising cultivation and possession for personal use were not contested in this case, and therefore not considered. South Africa In South Africa, on 18 September, 10 judges of the Constitutional Court ruled that it was not reasonable to penalise an adult who cultivates, or uses, or possesses cannabis for personal consumption in private. The laws were incompatible with Article 14 of the Constitution, which states that ‘Everyone has the right to privacy which includes the right not to have […] their possessions seized’. Mexico In Mexico, on 31 October, the Supreme Court gave its fifth judgement since 2015 stating that penalising private cultivation, possession and use of cannabis (and tetrahydrocannabinol) was unconstitutional, against the principle of free development of the personality. Other courts are obliged to follow Supreme Court judgements once five similar rulings have been delivered. All three courts emphasised that any private use of cannabis should not be in the presence of children. The courts also commented on trends in international developments in cannabis policy and use. The Georgian court noted the increasing application of human rights law in modern legal standards, and the South African court ruled that such state interference is not justified ‘in open and democratic societies’. In the 1988 UN Convention against trafficking, Article 3(2) states that a country should criminalise possession and cultivation for personal use ‘subject to its constitutional principles’. The court in Mexico stated that it upheld the constitutional principle of free development of personality and considered it was still in line with the Convention. The European Convention on Human Rights, Article 8(1), states that ‘Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence’, with limits, and the ‘private life’ has been interpreted to include the right to develop one’s own personality. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2019/cannabis-control-and-the-right-to-privacy_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0147	2018-12-19	UNK	Colorado publishes latest statistics on impact of cannabis legalisation 	 This news item was published in the EMCDDA’s Cannabis drug policy news on 17.12.2018 In the US state of Colorado, use and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes has been legal since January 2014, and it has been commercialised for medical purposes since 2009. The main arguments for legalisation were that it would increase law enforcement efficiency, revenue and individual freedom. The state government instructed the state Department of Public Safety to report on key statistics of cannabis-related topics including crime, impaired driving, hospital visits, usage rates, effects on youth. A second biennial report was released in October 2018. The main findings are as follows: Crime The number of serious crimes of illegal production and sale of cannabis fell considerably between 2008 and 2014, when they started to rise again. Cannabis-related organised crime cases varied over the period 2008 to 2013 but significantly increased between 2014 and 2017. Illegal cultivation The number of plants seized in Colorado by the DEA has varied since 2008, from 5 000 to 40 000 plants per year. Other seizures of plants grown on public lands have also fluctuated, but they steadily increased since 2014; in 2017, the National Forest Service seized over 70 000 plants. Diversion out of state The number and weight of cannabis products seized by the US postal service has increased every year since 2010. The number of seizures of Colorado-sourced herbal cannabis in other states peaked in 2015 and declined since, but increasingly more concentrates and edibles are being found. Road safety The percentage of arrests for cannabis-only impairment by the Colorado State Patrol has remained at 6-8 % since 2014. The share of drivers involved in fatal crashes who tested positive for any cannabinoid has increased from 11 % to 21 % over the last 4 years, but the percentage that tested positive above the state-defined level of impairment of 5 ng/ml blood-THC fell from 11.6 % in 2016 to 7.5 % in 2017 (recording blood-THC levels started only in 2016). Hospitalisations Cannabis-related hospitalisations have increased steadily since 2000. Calls to poison centres have levelled off since 2014, when stricter regulation and prevention measures were introduced to control edible products. School attendance School year 2016/17 was the first in which cannabis-related expulsions or law enforcement interventions were recorded separately, and it showed that cannabis was the single biggest reason for expulsions and interventions. Nevertheless, since school year 2009/10, the graduation rate has risen and the drop-out rate has fallen. Young cannabis users The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) questions about 500 young people in the state to compare with other states, and the Healthy Kids Colorado Survey (HKCS) now questions nearly 50 000 students. The rate of last-month cannabis use among 12- to 17-year-olds reported via NSDUH for the 2015/16 school year (9.1 %) was the lowest it has been since 2007/08. According to HKCS, the proportion of high school students reporting trying cannabis (lifetime use) or reporting past 30-day use did not vary to a statistically significant degree from 2005 to 2017. Revenue Cannabis taxes make up about 1.52 % of all tax revenue collected in the state.

EMCDDA_UNK_0148	2018-12-18	UNK	Registration now open for the eighth European drugs summer school	 The University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL) and the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) will be joining forces once again next summer to hold the eighth European drugs summer school (EDSS) on ‘Illicit drugs in Europe: demand, supply and public policies’ (1). Registration is now open for the two-week course, which will take place in the Portuguese capital from 24 June to 5 July (2). The initiative is also supported by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)(3). Through a multidisciplinary and interactive approach to the drugs problem, EMCDDA scientific experts, leading academics, guest speakers, policymakers and professionals having participated in previous rounds of the EDSS, will prepare participants to meet the complex policy challenges in this field — both in Europe and beyond. The focus of the 2019 course will be on interventions in prisons and alternatives to incarceration. Week 1 of the summer school, focusing on the ‘Drugs problem: substance use and problems, substance characteristics, and market’, will feature lectures on: the global burden of drug-related problems; drug markets in Europe; detecting new drugs; and prevention approaches in demand-reduction interventions. This session will also focus on the EMCDDA’s epidemiological indicators and their use in informing drug policy. Week 2, dedicated to ‘Policymaking for drug-related issues’, will include lectures on: drug policies and new challenges (concepts, issues and analysis); the EU drug strategy; drug laws and public expenditure; and monitoring supply reduction and drug enforcement activity. It will also include group discussion exercises on how to use the knowledge acquired during the course, to sustain drug-related debates. Finally, students will be guided through an analysis of the link between evidence and decision-making, including examples of implementation. Study visits to outreach facilities and to one of the Portuguese commissions for dissuasion will be organised over the two weeks. During the course, students will also participate in interactive workshops to discuss their own projects and views. The course will conclude with an open debate with guest speakers. The target audiences for the EDSS are: university students, researchers, professionals and administrators interested in working on drug issues. The previous rounds of the summer school brought together students from the EU Member States as well as from Africa, Asia, Australia and the Americas. Profiles of former alumni and their testimonials can be found on the official summer school website and their statements viewed in a promotional video (4). In 2019, students will again be able to apply for scholarships and ‘early-bird’ reductions are also available (5). The EDSS will be run in English. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/registration-open-for-eighth-european-drugs-summer-school_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0149	2018-12-14	UNK	Board re-elects French member Laura d’Arrigo as Chair and Austrian member Franz Pietsch as Vice-Chair	 The EMCDDA Management Board, meeting in Lisbon this week, held elections today for the positions of Chair and Vice-Chair of the Board. Laura d’Arrigo (France), Diplomatic advisor at the French Interministerial Mission for Combating Drugs and Addictive Behaviours (Mission interministérielle de lutte contre les drogues et les conduites addictives — MILDECA) was re-elected Chair for the next three years. Ms d’Arrigo has been member of the Board since December 2013 and is the first woman to hold the position. After several years working for the EU institutions, in particular the European Commission, Ms d’Arrigo was entrusted by the French authorities in 2007 to contribute to implementing and coordinating French foreign policy in the drugs field, both at bilateral and multilateral level. Between 2010 and 2014, she chaired the Permanent Correspondents of the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe. Franz Pietsch (Austria) was re-elected to the position of Vice-Chair today. Mr Pietsch, who has been a member of the Board since 2002, is representative of Austria regarding international matters of addiction and drug issues and is Deputy Director-General and Head of Department for Tobacco, Alcohol, Non-substance-related Addictions and International Affairs of Addiction. Commenting on the results, EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel said: ‘I congratulate the Chair and Vice-Chair on their re-election and thank them for their hard work and cooperation throughout their first mandate. I look forward to working with them in accomplishing the EMCDDA Strategy 2025 and work programme for 2019–21 and, together, contributing to a healthier and more secure Europe‘. Claude Gillard (Belgium), founding member of the agency, was also re-elected today as member and Chair of the EMCDDA Budget Committee. Mr Gillard has chaired the committee since 2003. Lars Petersen (Denmark) was elected as member of the Executive Committee. The Management Board is the EMCDDA’s main decision-making body and meets twice a year. It consists of one representative from each EU Member State, Turkey and Norway, two European Commission representatives and two independent experts in the drugs field designated by the European Parliament. At its meeting in Lisbon this week (13–14 December), the Board gave its final seal of approval on the agency’s 2019 budget and work programme 2019–21. Discussions also covered cooperation between the agency and Albania and Ukraine and procedures for establishing a list of experts to assist the EMCDDA Scientific Committee in risk assessments of new psychoactive substances. A call for expression of interest will be launched on the agency’s website in Spring 2019. Finally, the Board discussed the key conclusions of an external evaluation of the EMCDDA and recent developments in cannabis policies. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/11/board-re-elects-french-member-laura-d%E2%80%99arrigo-chair-and-austrian-member-franz-pietsch-vice-chair_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0150	2018-12-13	UNK	Innovative EMCDDA monitoring method sheds light on changes in Europe’s cocaine market	 The latest changes in Europe’s cocaine market are explored in a new report published today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). The report follows an analysis in the European Drug Report 2018, which highlighted an increase in the availability of high-purity cocaine in Europe, shifting trafficking routes and rising numbers of first-time admissions to specialised treatment. Drawing on the agency’s innovative ‘trendspotter’ methodology, the new publication looks behind the scenes at factors driving these developments. Today’s report is the result of a recent study, applying the ‘trendspotter’ methodology, which is used by the agency to explore emerging drug trends, new patterns of use and developing drug markets. This method — which complements more traditional drug monitoring techniques — incorporates data from multiple sources and uses a variety of investigative approaches to allow for rapid assessments of topics of concern. The study included: two web surveys among national experts; an expert meeting and a review of international literature and monitoring data. Europe is the second largest market for cocaine in the world (after North America) with an annual estimated retail market value of at least EUR 5.7 billion. Cocaine is the most commonly used illicit stimulant drug in Europe, with around 2.3 million young adults (15–34 years) having used it in the last year (EU-28). Around 98 000 seizures of cocaine were reported in the EU in 2016 (90 000 in 2015), amounting to 70.9 tonnes. Although the price of cocaine remained stable, its purity at street level reached its highest level in a decade in 2016. Competition and innovation in the cocaine trade — call centres and fast delivery The report describes new developments in the cocaine trade, including greater competition and innovation. This is occurring against a backdrop of rising coca cultivation and cocaine production in Latin America (since 2014), one of the main drivers behind the surge in supply. A greater number of organised crime groups (OCGs), operating in the European cocaine market, are now directly involved in the trade with cocaine source countries. Traditional cocaine smuggling methods are also evolving, with increasingly innovative concealment methods used, new trafficking routes emerging, and entry points into Europe multiplying. ‘As a result, large quantities of cocaine appear to be entering Europe at a regular pace, and law enforcement and customs agents are facing challenges in containing the flow’, states the report. Novel technologies, such as encrypted communication applications, cryptomarkets and social media are playing an increasing role in enabling smaller groups and individual ‘entrepreneurs’ to engage in cocaine dealing. Innovative distribution strategies include cocaine-exclusive ‘call centres’ with couriers delivering ‘anywhere at any time’. The report states: ‘We are now seeing a qualitative change in the nature of cocaine dealing, whereby social media are used to promote cocaine and other illicit drugs relatively openly, with the aim of reaching as many potential consumers as possible’. Spread to new and emerging markets — rural areas, eastern Europe and Asia According to today’s report, cocaine is emerging in new markets, with OCGs in some countries expanding their operations from major cities to smaller towns and rural areas. There are also signs that cocaine is spreading into new markets in eastern Europe, where amphetamines have long been the stimulant drug of choice. A question raised by the study is whether Europe has become a transit region for new cocaine markets in western Asia. Consumer dynamics — ‘normalisation’ Targeted surveys and data collection in nightlife settings, drug consumption rooms and wastewater studies appear to point to a rise in cocaine use in recent years. The study reveals that, in certain youth cultures, there appears to be a lower risk perception towards cocaine. Trendspotter experts reporting on nightlife settings described the increasing acceptability and ‘normalisation’ of the use of powder cocaine across diverse social groups, manifested in ‘greater overtness and visibility of use’. Harms and implications for policy Various harms have been linked to recent increases in the availability and use of cocaine. At a societal level, some countries report violence among small OCGs competing for local cocaine markets. At consumer level, data from hospital emergency units reveal that it is primarily a young population of cocaine users which appears in emergency rooms at weekends (often as a result of co-use of cocaine and alcohol). Higher purity levels of cocaine may further increase the potential for harm. The number of deaths involving cocaine, mostly in association with alcohol and opioids, has increased in several countries in recent years. Health experts surveyed in the study highlighted the limited availability of tailored treatment and harm reduction options for stimulant users (especially for younger cocaine users) and stressed the need for further investment. Also published today… The EMCDDA also releases today a Trendspotter manual — A handbook for the rapid assessment of emerging drug-related trends. This user-friendly guide, presenting the trendspotter methodology, is a key component of an EMCDDA training package and has been piloted in national studies. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘The EMCDDA trendspotter approach has become an essential tool for the agency in its work to understand and obtain rapid insights into Europe’s new drug trends and drug-related phenomena. Today we share important insights into the latest dynamics in Europe’s cocaine market across different user groups, settings and national drug markets. Results from trendspotter studies of this kind can be invaluable to all those working in the drugs field who may need to respond rapidly to new challenges’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/10/trendspotter-method-europes-cocaine-market_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0151	2018-12-12	UNK	EMCDDA takes stock of EU-ANSA activities in 2018	 This month, the EMCDDA approaches the end of its presidency of the EU Agencies’ Network on Scientific Advice (EU-ANSA) and looks back on a productive year (1). EU-ANSA is one of the sub-networks operating under the Heads of EU agencies network. Its specific purpose is to allow dialogue between senior scientific staff from agencies with a strong science component to their work and to provide scientific and technical advice to EU institutions, Member States and other relevant EU policymakers. Each agency is represented in the network by its Chief Scientist, or the equivalent member of staff responsible for the scientific output. Having taken over the rotating presidency from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on 1 January 2018, the EMCDDA will act as chair until 31 December, before handing over to the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) in 2019. The focus of EU-ANSA activities in 2018 was on consolidating and completing ongoing activities, in areas such as communicating scientific uncertainty and engaging with research. The network also continued its work on ‘research clusters’, which assess the research and development needs common to the EU-ANSA agencies and address cross-cutting topical themes (e.g. exposure science, quantitative survey data). A number of new initiatives were completed in 2018. These included a preliminary stock taking of EU agencies’ approaches to ‘open access’ publications (particularly academic papers) and a mapping of terminology in the area of ‘futures’ (e.g. foresight, forecasting, early warning, horizon scanning, threat assessment). In the course of the year, the network also published two reflection papers. The first of these — ‘EU-ANSA Agencies’ engagement in the EU research knowledge cycle: an overview’ — was presented to the Heads of EU agencies in February and to the Director-General of the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Research and Innovation (DG-RTD) in November. It highlights the potential added value of the EU-ANSA agencies in identifying knowledge gaps and common research and development needs. The second paper — ‘Approaches to assess and manage scientific uncertainty: examples from EU-ANSA agencies’ — takes stock of current practices in agencies and reflects on best practices with a view to developing common principles. During its mandate, the EMCDDA chaired two EU-ANSA meetings: one in May — hosted by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre in Ispra — and one in November — hosted by DG-RTD in Brussels. These facilitated a common understanding in approaches and methods for the provision of scientific advice and the exchange of information and coordination between EU-ANSA agencies.

EMCDDA_UNK_0152	2018-12-06	UNK	Signature of working arrangements with five EU agencies	 Europe’s ability to rapidly respond to public health and social threats caused by new psychoactive substances (NPS/‘new drugs’) has been significantly strengthened thanks to new legislation applying from 23 November (1). The legislation strengthens the EU Early Warning System (EU EWS) and risk assessment procedures on NPS and shortens control processes. Under the new legislation, and via working arrangements, the EMCDDA will now be cooperating with five EU agencies (previously three): the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC); the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA); the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA); the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and Europol. Existing working arrangements with ECDC, EMA and Europol have been updated, while new arrangements will be signed with ECHA and EFSA (2). ECDC On 4 December, Mr Goosdeel and ECDC Director Andrea Ammon signed the updated EMCDDA–ECDC working arrangement in Brussels. This followed their participation at the European Parliament in a high-level panel discussion ‘EU 2019–2024: How can we support viral hepatitis elimination in line with the WHO Global Strategy and UN SDGs?’ Having worked together in areas relating to data collection, knowledge exchange and sharing of best practice in the monitoring of infections associated with injecting drug use, the two agencies will now also be sharing information and data relating to NPS, their use and potential public health and social risks. Europol Today (6 December), Mr Goosdeel and Europol Director Catherine de Bolle will sign the updated EMCDDA–Europol working arrangement in Brussels. This establishes a procedure for sharing information on the activities of criminal groups in the manufacture, trafficking and sale of NPS and will further strengthen the agencies’ cooperation on drug-related security threats. The EMCDDA and Europol have been working together since 1997 to monitor the appearance of ‘new drugs’ and the extent of their diffusion in Europe via the EU EWS (3). Present at the signing ceremony, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Dimitris Avramopoulos congratulated the two agencies on the agreement. See the Commissioner’s statement on the DG-HOME website. EMCDDA staff will also be at Europol headquarters in The Hague today for the ‘2ndAnnual conference: Drugs in Europe — a bold law enforcement response’. To coincide with this event, the two agencies are releasing on their websites a joint publication entitled Improved drug supply indicators for Europe: progress report. EMA On 7 December, Mr Goosdeel will travel to London where he will sign the updated EMCDDA–EMA working arrangement with EMA Director Guido Rasi. The former arrangement, which enabled the bilateral sharing of information through the pharmacovigilance system, largely on NPS, has now been extended to include the abuse of substances intended for medicinal use in humans or veterinary products. This reflects the dynamics of the European drug market and the adulteration of existing drugs with medicinal products. These new arrangements will align the agencies’ working relationships with the new legislation as well as with the on-going observed changes in the European drug situation. They also enable better preparedness for potential future developments in the increasingly complex and fast-moving world of drug production and marketing facing European citizens. The working arrangements with ECHA and EFSA are scheduled to be signed early in 2019. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/signature-of-working-arrangements-with-five-eu-agencies_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0153	2018-12-04	UNK	EU drugs agency publishes its first report on the medical use of cannabis	 What is the evidence base for the medical use of cannabis and cannabinoids? What is the difference between cannabis preparations and medicinal products and why is this important? How is this issue regulated in the EU? These and other questions are explored in a new report published today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA): Medical use of cannabis and cannabinoids: questions and answers for policymaking. The report responds to growing interest in this topic as more European countries develop policies and practice in this area.   ʻMany EU countries now allow, or are considering allowing, the medical use of cannabis or cannabinoids in some formʼ, states the report. But approaches vary widely between countries, both in terms of the products permitted and the regulatory frameworks governing their provision. Understanding this variety of national approaches is important for an informed policy debate in this area in the EU. Todayʼs report aims to explore current practice in the EU regarding the provision of these substances for medical purposes and clarify some of the complex issues in this area in order to support science, policy and practice. The report notes that the terms ʻmedical use of cannabis and cannabinoidsʼ can refer to a wide variety of products and preparations that may contain different active ingredients and use different routes of administration (Figure 1). The publication provides a state-of-the-art overview of evidence for the medical use of cannabis and cannabinoids (Table 1). It concludes that more research and clinical studies are needed to fill ʻimportant gaps in the evidenceʼ.  From the US and Canada, to Australia and Israel, the report presents a selection of case studies illustrating the diverse approaches used by countries outside the EU to allow the medical use of cannabis. The report highlights the challenges of decision-making in this area and summarises the multiple issues that governments may consider when deciding whether to make cannabis or cannabinoids available for medical use. These include: the types of product that patients will be allowed to use; the medical conditions for which such products can be used; and the type of medical and regulatory supervision under which patients are allowed to use them. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: 'In most countries, the provision of cannabis and cannabinoid products and preparations for medical purposes has evolved over time, often in response to patient demand or product development. This report seeks to provide an objective look at current evidence, practice and experience in this very fast-moving field and describe the complex patchwork of approaches adopted in the EU and beyond. Lastly, it points to the importance of developing a common language on this issue to help build a base for evaluation and assessmentʼ.

EMCDDA_UNK_0154	2018-11-28	UNK	Reitox academy: professionalising the prevention workforce through standardised training  	 Over 50 representatives of the Reitox national focal points (NFPs) and decision-makers from more than 20 countries will gather in Prague this week for a Reitox academy on the theme of prevention (1). The two-day course will centre on the European adaptation of the Universal Prevention Curriculum (UPC), taken forward by the European Commission-funded Universal Prevention Curriculum in Europe project (UPC-ADAPT)(2)(3). Set up in 2016 to adapt the UPC to the European context, UPC-ADAPT has been piloting materials this year in nine EU Member States (Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Estonia, Spain, Croatia, Italy, Poland and Slovenia). The Reitox academy is organised by the EMCDDA and the UPC-Adapt Group in collaboration with the 1st Faculty of Medicine at the Charles University in Prague and the Czech National Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Addiction. The event takes place within the final conference of the UPC-Adapt project, supported by the European Commission. UPC-ADAPT has distilled the original UPC nine-week curriculum into shorter, more intense, interactive training modules, which can be delivered in three forms (of up to five days in length). These are: training online; training for local or regional decision-, opinion- and policymakers (DOPs) and training in academic settings (future DOPs). The aim is to implement a standardised prevention curriculum with a European prevention language (European Universal Prevention Curriculum/EUPC), based on international quality standards for mid-level staff training. The purpose of the Reitox academy is to: provide an overview of the UPC-ADAPT project and its results to date; raise awareness of the potential of European countries to launch the EUPC; and explore partnerships with universities to implement the full UPC in their syllabi. The academy is held in Prague in acknowledgment of the Czech Republic being a pioneer and key player in developing the first accreditation system for prevention workers and one of the countries currently piloting and testing the UPC-ADAPT materials. The EUPC training series aims to reduce the health, social, and economic problems associated with substance use by professionalising the prevention workforce and strengthening their knowledge and skills and advocacy capacity for evidence-based interventions. The first step in achieving this is through the EUPC training of current and future DOPs, during which the most effective evidence-based prevention interventions and strategies are conveyed and discussed. The ultimate goal of the initiative is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of prevention at local and regional levels by training decision-makers to properly allocate funds for interventions with science-based approaches. Prevention can be harmful, particularly towards young people, and well-informed decision-makers would phase out the financing and support for intuitive, informational approaches, which can be unsafe. This event is in line with the EMCDDA Strategy 2025, which aims to support interventions which prevent drug use by facilitating knowledge transfer, adoption of best practice. It also reflects the Reitox Development Framework, adopted in 2017, which calls for more horizontal cooperation between the NFPs and greater exchange of best practice through common capacity development activities. Next year, the EMCDDA will be publishing the reference handbook of the EUPC.From 2019 onwards, the EMCDDA and future project partners are also planning to broaden the project to include ‘training-of-trainer’ events and other support-to-practice activities. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/reitox-academy-on-universal-prevention-curriculum_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0155	2018-11-27	UNK	Expert meeting to examine implementation of evidence-based interventions on drugs 	 Experts in the implementation of evidence-based interventions from Europe and North America are gathering at the EMCDDA this week for the agency’s first technical meeting on ‘Pathways to implementation’. Implementing responses to drug problems is an important but often neglected area. Regardless of the evidence that exists to support the use of a response option, it is unlikely to be effective if it is implemented poorly (1). Over the course of two days (27–28 November), the experts will share their experience and implementation approaches. During the meeting, the experts will identify and discuss with EMCDDA staff how the agency can best support practitioners and implementation agents in choosing the approaches that best address their needs. Attention will also be paid to the: taxonomy of definitions; role of standards, guidelines and training; and expansion of registries of evidence-based programmes, such as the EMCDDA’s Xchange prevention registry. The expert meeting is aligned with the agency’s commitment to support practice, as outlined in the EMCDDA Strategy 2025. In addition, it builds on other EMCDDA projects that seek both to support the implementation of evidence-based interventions and to consolidate consensus on their importance. These include the: Best practice portal (which makes available online syntheses of evidence, examples of best practice and tools for implementation); the Health and social responses to drug problems: a European guide (2017); and engagement in the further implementation in Europe of training curricula (such as the European Universal Prevention Curriculum). The meeting will result in the development of an expert group in the implementation of evidence-based interventions and in a publication on implementation approaches. Experts participating in this meeting include representatives of EU institutions; universities and institutes and scientific journals. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/meeting-to-examine-implementation-of-evidence-based-interventions-on-drugs_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0156	2018-11-23	UNK	New legislation, bringing faster response to new drugs, applies from today	 Europe’s ability to rapidly respond to public health and social threats caused by new psychoactive substances (NPS/‘new drugs’) will be significantly strengthened, thanks to new legislation applying from today (1). The legislation — applicable across Europe from 23 November 2018 — strengthens the EU Early Warning System (EU EWS) and risk assessment procedures on NPS and shortens control processes. The legislation comes in response to the recent growth in the availability of NPS and follows proposals from the European Commission (EC). The new legislative package consists of: a Regulation regarding information exchange on, and an early-warning system and risk-assessment procedure for, new psychoactive substances, amending the EMCDDA recast founding regulation (2); a Directive, which allows NPS to be controlled at EU level as ‘drugs’ (3). The legislation retains Europe’s current three-step approach to responding to NPS — early warning, risk assessment and control measures — while significantly strengthening existing processes by streamlining and accelerating data-collection and assessment procedures. A new feature in the regulation allows for the potential risks posed by several NPS with a similar chemical structure to be assessed together in a combined risk assessment report. Throughout the new procedure, shorter deadlines are introduced. The EMCDDA will continue to play a leading role in early warning on, and monitoring of, NPS reported by EU Member States and will initiate a scientific investigation into any new substance causing concern at EU level. Following the submission by the agency of its initial report, the EC will have two weeks to ask the agency to assess the potential risks posed by the substance, to be delivered within six weeks. Based on the risk assessment report, the Commission may propose to control the substance. The Council of the EU and the European Parliament will then have two months to decide whether they agree. Member States’ authorities will have six months (instead of 12 under the previous system) to place the substance under control, at national level, once the decision enters into force. In 2017, 51 NPS were reported for the first time to the EU EWS — a rate of around one per week. By the end of 2017, the EMCDDA was monitoring over 670 NPS (compared with around 350 in 2013). Health and social harms linked to new synthetic cannabinoids and new synthetic opioids — including acute intoxications and deaths — prompted the EMCDDA to conduct an unprecedented nine risk assessments in 2017. The EMCDDA and Europol— with the support of the EU Member States, the European Medicines Agency (EMA ) and the European Commission—have been working together since 1997 to monitor the appearance of ‘new drugs’ and the extent of their diffusion in Europe. The first legislative frameworks (1997 and 2005) (4) allowed the partners to develop an advanced early-warning system for monitoring ‘new drugs’ and a structure for performing scientific risk assessments. Under the new legislation, further EU agencies will also be involved, including the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, European Chemicals Agency and European Food Safety Authority. Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, declared: ‘Over the last ten years, the emergence of new psychoactive substances has presented major challenges to public health and safety. These are often highly toxic synthetic substances which become all the more dangerous in easily adapting and changing markets. This is why we need effective legal and operational tools to enable swifter action to ban these substances from the EU, in order to prevent serious health damage, and sometimes even death. The new EU rules will better protect our citizens across the EU from these dangerous drugs — in particular young people.’ EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel said: ‘The EMCDDA welcomes the new legislation to strengthen Europe’s response to new psychoactive substances, which may cause serious health and social risks to users. The rise in the availability of NPS over the past decade, and harms associated with them, require us to boost our early-warning and response capacities. This faster legal mechanism will help us keep pace with the NPS phenomen on and ensure that prompt action is taken to protect public health’.

EMCDDA_UNK_0157	2018-11-16	UNK	Canada’s cannabis legalisation enters into force	 This news item was published in the EMCDDA’s Cannabis drug policy news on 16.11.2018 In Canada, a law to legalise recreational use of cannabis, which had been proposed in the Liberal party’s election manifesto in 2015 and passed in June 2018, entered into force on 17 October 2018. The declared objectives of the law are to protect the health of young people, to reduce and deter illicit activities with cannabis, to reduce the burden on the criminal justice system, and to control the quality of cannabis supplied. It is a national law but many aspects such as age limits, driving limits, and who supplies the shops are regulated at the level of each of Canada’s 13 provinces and territories. The delay between passing and entry into force of the law was to allow the regions to decide on such issues. Canada already has a national law permitting production and use of cannabis for medical purposes since 2014. Cultivation The new law permits cultivation and production by licensed private companies. In most provinces, private citizens may also grow some plants at home. Initial cultivation and production will mainly be by those companies already producing cannabis preparations for medical use. Producers will usually supply a provincial authority, who then manages distribution to the retail outlets. The number of suppliers in each province varies; while some provinces have reported agreements with only one supplier, there are currently 14 licensed suppliers in Manitoba and 31 in British Columbia. Sales outlets Sales outlets will be regulated at provincial level. Distribution from producer to outlet will be usually managed by a government-run provincial body, often the body responsible for alcohol (liquor) distribution. In some provinces, the outlets will be publicly owned, such as the networks of state liquor shops, in others they will be privately owned. Some provinces intend to limit the number of outlets, others will not. Sales and delivery are also possible online. Canada already has experience of this with cannabis for medical use being delivered to remote areas. Ontario, the most populous province, will currently only sell cannabis through the government online shop, though physical outlets are expected in spring 2019. Product limits Herbal cannabis and cannabis oil can be sold, but not edible products containing cannabis, such as cookies and chocolate. The federal law limits possession in public to 30 g of dried herbal cannabis or its legally defined equivalent. Pre-packaged products are limited to 1 g dried cannabis or 10 mg of THC per unit, and maximum concentration of 30 mg THC/ml for oil. Packaging is expected to be plain and will carry a standardised symbol for THC and health warnings. Health Canada anticipates that cannabis-containing edible products will be permitted within the next year. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/canada-cannabis-legislation-enters-into-force_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0158	2018-11-15	UNK	Monitoring drug use in recreational settings across Europe — new report out today	 How to build a better picture of substance use in recreational settings is explored today in a new EMCDDA report: Monitoring drug use in recreational settings across Europe: conceptual challenges and methodological innovations. The report examines how drug-use data are currently collected in recreational settings, and identifies the benefits and challenges of monitoring in these milieux. Highlighted in the report is the need for standardised data-collection tools to improve comparability in Europe. The report describes how self-report targeted population surveys (TPSs) in situ are becoming an increasingly important part of monitoring activities across countries. Online self-report targeted surveys of ‘recreational drug users’ are also flagged as exciting opportunities to improve monitoring. The need to include questions in general population surveys (GPS) that might capture drug use in recreational settings is similarly raised. The report shows how specific drugs, drug-using populations and recreational settings dominate investigations, while others tend to be ignored. Research largely focuses on night-time-economy (NTE) locations, such as clubs and bars, leaving a significant knowledge gap around drug use in other recreational settings (e.g. private parties, illegal raves). The point is made that drug use takes place in both private and public recreational settings and that targeted surveys need to focus on more diverse (and previously hidden) populations to include under-researched relevant spaces, places and times across Europe. It is argued that those using drugs in recreational settings are not a homogeneous group and that statistical data collected in this milieu can capture this diversity, allowing for better designed and targeted interventions. According to the report: ‘Improved monitoring of substance use in recreational settings can help build a better evidence base for more balanced, proportionate drug policies aimed at prevention and harm reduction’. It adds: ‘Looking to the future, there are positive signs that the complexity of studying drug use in recreational settings across Europe is being recognised… The European drugs research community is becoming attuned to the nuances of substance use in a range of recreational settings where many of Europe’s citizens want to spend their leisure time safely’. Finally, the report describes how biomedical data, drug-checking and wastewater analyses have emerged as novel data sources for capturing aspects of drug use in specific locales (although these should be treated with caution and supplemented with survey research when possible). Today EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel is speaking at the opening plenary session of NIGHTS2018, the 4th international conference on night-time economy, culture, urban development and health issues (15–17 November, Brussels). The event — co-organised by Modus Vivendi, VAD, Transit and the Nightlife Empowerment and Well-being Network — also marks the 25th anniversary of ‘Modus Vivendi’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/monitoring-drug-use-recreational-settings-across-europe_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0160	2018-11-13	UNK	2018 Reitox week focuses on ‘futures’	 Representatives of candidate, potential candidate and neighbouring countries of the EU and countries of Central Asia are joining members of the EMCDDA’s Reitox network (1) in Lisbon from 12–16 November for the agency’s seventh Reitox week. The purpose of this annual event is to broaden the scope of the regular Heads of national focal point (NFP) meetings, underline the usefulness of the EU drug monitoring model; add impetus to the agency’s technical cooperation with countries outside the EU and learn from each other’s experience. The 2018 Reitox week unites some 50 nations, including: 30 NFPs (28 EU, Turkey and Norway); six countries of the Western Balkans (beneficiaries of the European Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance/IPA); eight European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) countries; and four partner countries of the Central Asia Drug Action Programme (CADAP). The week encompasses three events: a coordination meeting with partner countries of the Eastern and Southern Neighbourhood (12 November); an ‘extended meeting’ of the Reitox network (13 November) and the regular Heads of focal point meeting (14–16 November). This year, the theme chosen for the extended meeting is ‘Changes in patterns of drug supply and use and their implications for monitoring’, due to its relevance for the EMCDDA’s foresight exercise (2017–20). Outlined in the EMCDDA Strategy 2025, this exercise will help the agency maintain a state-of-the-art understanding of the extent of drug use, patterns, trends and its impact on public health and identify future reporting needs. The extended meeting includes presentations from representatives of the: EMCDDA Scientific Committee; European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC); EU Satellite Centre; UNODC, Norwegian Institute for Water Research and Pardee Center for International Futures. Presentations during this session cover a wide range of topics including: mega trends; a model for global forecasting; global trends and changes in drug use and drug markets; web-driven data sources (open source information monitoring) and new advanced technology driven data, including wastewater and mobile technology and satellite data. The Reitox network was set up in 1993 and is composed of 30 NFPs in the 28 EU Member States, Turkey and Norway, as well as a focal point at the European Commission. The NFPs — from which the agency draws the bulk of its data — collect and analyse national information on drugs, drawing on various sectors including health, justice and law enforcement.

EMCDDA_UNK_0161	2018-10-24	UNK	Prevention technologies — European prevention conference opens today 	 What do we know about how research evidence is used in the ‘real world’ of prevention? How can we take advantage of technology to promote the use of evidence in policy and practice? What are some of the biggest implementation challenges in prevention and how do we address these? These are among the questions being addressed this week at the 9th annual conference of the European Society for Prevention Research (EUSPR) (24–26 October). The event, ‘Prevention technologies — improving the use of evidence in prevention practice’, is co-organised in Lisbon by the EUSPR and the EMCDDA. In many areas of public health, and particularly in the field of prevention, there is frequently a gap between research evidence and the services and interventions delivered in daily practice. This may mean that public resources are wasted or that target groups and communities are unable to receive the interventions or other support that might benefit them most. At the conference, keynote speakers will explore some of the major issues in implementation and translational science as well as highlight strategies that have been successful in bringing together prevention research, practice and policymaking (1). Looking at the use of new technologies in this process, speakers will address how these might offer fresh opportunities for delivering evidence-based interventions and programmes and provide a platform for better engagement across different sectors. In addition to looking at what works in prevention, the conference will also pay attention to what does not, via a special session devoted to ‘Embracing failure in prevention science’. This will underline the importance of publishing trial results that show ‘no effects’ or ‘harmful effects’ in order to avoid ‘research waste’ and optimise performance. The conference will map the obstacles that hinder the uptake and roll-out of effective interventions and local policies in preventing unhealthy behaviours. It will also increase dialogue between practitioners and researchers on how best to overcome them. In order to boost this dialogue, one of the pre-conference events will be a joint exchange activity sponsored by, and held at, the Lisbon City Hall. This will bring together early-career researchers and prevention professionals to discuss common goals and to air views on how evidence should be best presented and used. The EMCDDA strives to support evidence-based prevention and to promote greater use of interventions which are proven to be effective. However, simply publishing evidence is not enough. This is why the agency proactively promotes training in prevention science and practice. Here, the agency is engaging in the further implementation in Europe of training curricula — such as the European Universal Prevention Curriculum (EUPC) — and is aware that good collaboration with networks of scientists and practitioners, such as the EUSPR, is important to achieve this goal. In the margins of the meeting, the EMCDDA and the EUSPR will discuss Xchange, the agency’s online registry of evidence-based prevention programmes launched last October in its Best Practice Portal. Through this registry, interested visitors can access empirically proven effective programmes, along with experiences of their adaptation across different countries. The EUSPR is supporting the EMCDDA in expanding this registry to include programmes targeting other risky behaviours such as delinquency and violence. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/european-prevention-conference-opens-today_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0163	2018-10-22	UNK	New EMCDDA Paper explores the illicit captagon market 	 What is captagon? Where is it used and produced? Can it be linked to terrorist attacks in Europe? These are some of the questions explored in the latest edition in the EMCDDA Papers series launched today Captagon: understanding today’s illicit market. The report provides an overview of what is currently known about the captagon phenomenon in order to assist those working in the illicit drugs field who may need to respond to the issue. Captagon® was originally the brand name for a medicinal product containing fenetylline produced since the 1960s and serving licit markets in Europe and the Middle East. Sold in tablet form, with a characteristic logo comprising two half-moons, it was prescribed as a treatment for conditions such as attention deficit disorder and narcolepsy. Today, it is no longer produced or used for therapeutic purposes. After fenetylline was placed under international control in 1986, traffickers sometimes based in eastern Europe started producing tablets containing other substances, especially amphetamine, which were then sold as ‘captagon’ on markets for stimulants in the Middle East. Captagon use as we know it today The report reviews what is known about current use, production and supply of captagon. It describes how recent reports of captagon use no longer refer to the diverted medicinal product Captagon® but to clandestinely produced tablets commonly containing amphetamine and often caffeine (but which still bear a logo similar to original Captagon® tablets). Where is captagon used? Captagon is reported to be a commonly used stimulant in the Middle East. While little information is available on the captagon consumer markets in these countries, anecdotal and expert reports, as well as insights from supply-side information, suggest that, in many countries, the use of captagon may be significant. Interviews with law enforcement officers suggest that, since 2014, captagon seizures have been increasing in a number of Middle East countries (particularly Israel, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates). Tens of millions of tablets, most of which carried the captagon logo, were also seized between 2010 and 2014 in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. These countries were usually assumed to be transit or production territories for captagon, and not large consumer markets, but recent data suggest that use in this area may be also on the rise (particularly in Syria). Where is captagon produced? While illicit captagon was originally sourced mainly from eastern Europe, production appears to have shifted into the Middle East, the drug’s main consumer market. Production methods used there show many similarities with those used in Europe, suggesting that European organised crime groups may be involved in Middle East amphetamine production. The report also describes how amphetamine produced in Europe may be shipped to the Middle East in bulk or in the form of captagon tablets. Can captagon be linked to terrorist attacks in Europe? Some media reports have linked captagon use to the perpetrators of terrorist acts in Europe or terrorist groups based in areas of conflict in the Middle East. Forensic pathology findings did not detect the use of ‘illicit drugs or alcohol’ by the terrorists involved in the attack in the Bataclan venue (Paris) on 13 November 2015. Nor has captagon use been directly implicated in attacks in other European countries. The report concludes that the suggested links between terrorism and captagon use featuring in media reports appear to have been overstated. As is the case for other types of drug, some terrorist groups may exploit the captagon market to finance their activities and some terrorists may at times use drugs, but the evidence available does not indicate any particular association between captagon and terrorism within the EU. This report is based on a report in French Captagon: déconstruction d’un mythe, published in July 2017 by the Observatoire français des drogues et des toxicomanies (the French national focal point in the Reitox network) and the EMCDDA. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/new-emcdda-paper-explores-illicit-captagon-market_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0164	2018-10-10	UNK	Alexis Goosdeel pays official visit to Cyprus 	 EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel is paying an official visit to Cyprus today, where he is meeting with health and security officials. This is in line with the EMCDDA Strategy 2025, which aims to contribute to a healthier and more secure Europe. The visit will include meetings with the Cypriot Health Minister, Mr Konstantinos Ioannou and with Director of Mental Health Services, Dr Anna Paradisiotou. These meetings will pay particular attention to harm reduction measures, including the provision of sterile syringes to people who inject drugs and measures to increase the uptake of HIV and hepatitis testing by users at risk from these infections. Other issues on the agenda include the importance of surveying the prison population to obtain a picture of drug use and infection risk. Monitoring drug-related hospital emergencies will also be explored, as a means to ensure vigilance in a rapidly-changing drug situation and to help deliver timely and effective responses. On the security side, Mr Goosdeel will meet the Chief of the Drug Law Enforcement Unit of the Cyprus police, Glykerios Leontiou, to review improvements in monitoring and prevention activities related to drug trafficking through airports and ports. They will also discuss the importance of monitoring drug-related crime and the contribution of Cyprus to the EU Early Warning System on new psychoactive substances. During the visit, Mr Goosdeel will meet the Management Board of the Cyprus National Addictions Authority, including the Head of the national focal point in the Reitox network. Talks will centre on the potential for further developing cooperation between Cyprus and the EMCDDA, the agency’s work priorities, the importance of drug policy evaluation and the need for evidence-based harm-reduction programmes. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/alexis-goosdeel-pays-official-visit-to-cyprus_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0165	2018-10-09	UNK	Low-THC cannabis products being sold in the EU – key legal issues 	 This news item was published in the EMCDDA’s Cannabis drug policy news on 09.10.2018 Since 2017, herbal cannabis and cannabis oils have been offered for open sale in health food shops or specialist shops in several EU countries, including France, Italy, Luxembourg and Austria. Sales have taken place based on the claim that these products have little or no intoxicating effect and therefore are not controlled under drug laws. The EMCDDA network of national legal correspondents recently addressed this issue. What do international drug control laws say? The UN drug control conventions state that unauthorised sale of ‘cannabis flowers’ and ‘extracts and tinctures of cannabis’ should be subject to criminal penalties in national drug control laws. Cannabis flowers and extracts usually contain the two cannabinoids THC and CBD, but the percentage of each can vary greatly, by plant variety and by growing technique. THC can cause intoxicating effects, while CBD has been associated with health benefits, though there is little evidence for most conditions that have been studied. The WHO expert committee on drug dependence recently recommended that pure CBD should not be listed under the drug conventions. Do EU regulations apply? The EU common agricultural policy subsidises growing certain varieties of the cannabis plant for industrial uses, provided their THC content does not exceed 0.2 %. The EU also has several directives and regulations that might address the sale of low-THC products, including standardised definitions of medicinal products, herbal medicines, food and food supplements, cosmetics, general product safety etc. As classification is usually decided by national regulatory bodies, depending on the country, a cannabis product could potentially be classified as a medicine, a food or a consumer product. Are national responses similar? Member States’ responses to open sale can range from stating that plant-derived THC- or CBD-containing products are cannabis extracts, and therefore subject to criminal penalties, to stating that some of those products have insignificant psychoactive properties and are therefore at low risk of misuse and unlikely to pose a threat to public health, and so do not require any licence for trade. First, countries differ in their response towards low-THC products. Some countries state that a product containing less than 0.3% or 0.2% THC is not controlled under drug laws. For others, an unlicensed product must not contain any THC at all. But these quantitative limits may also come with conditions, such as ‘originating from an authorised variety of cannabis’, ‘if not viable for narcotic purposes’, ‘if not misused’. In addition, countries have developed different responses towards products containing CBD. There seem to be few quantitative limits to CBD but more conditions. The legality of marketing the product may depend on the source of the CBD, it may depend on the format of the product, and it may depend on how the product is presented. What do these products contain? National forensic analyses of ‘low-THC’ cannabis herb in Italy, Luxembourg and Austria found that they were indeed low in THC. However, some products sold as ‘high in CBD’ have been found to contain levels of THC that may cause intoxication, which some users would not expect. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/low-thc-cannabis-products-being-sold-in-the-EU%E2%80%93key-legal-issues_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0166	2018-10-03	UNK	EMCDDA and the Republic of Albania strengthen their cooperation	 EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel is participating this week in the EU-Western Balkans Ministerial Forum on Justice and Home Affairs, taking place from 4–5 October in Tirana. Organised under the auspices of the Austrian presidency of the EU, the meeting will be attended by European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Dimitris Avramopoulos and by Austrian Federal Minister of the Interior Herbert Kickl. During the visit, Mr Goosdeel will discuss the next steps for EMCDDA–Albania cooperation with the country’s Deputy Minister of the Interior Besfort Lamallari and Deputy Minister of Health and Social Protection Mira Rakacolli. The EMCDDA began its cooperation with Albania in 2007 (1) in the framework of EU-funded technical assistance projects designed to prepare Western Balkan countries for accession to the EU (and for participation in the work of the EMCDDA and its Reitox network). The EMCDDA and Albania are currently working together to consolidate Albania’s capacity to monitor the drug phenomenon through the use of evidence-based tools and knowledge built and promoted within the EU. While no formal national drug observatory has yet been established in Albania (along the lines of a Reitox national focal point), the EMCDDA has developed close working relations with the Ministry of the Interior and with the Institute of Public Health of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection. This cooperation led to the financing of the first national general population survey on drugs in Albania in 2014 as well as the production of a new national drug report in 2017 following EMCDDA guidelines. The EMCDDA and Albania also exchange expertise and data on new psychoactive substances as well as on the establishment of a national early-warning system. Working Arrangement in the pipeline In October 2017, the Albanian Minister of the Interior submitted a request to the EMCDDA Director for a formal Working Arrangement (WA) with the agency. While the EMCDDA has signed similar agreements with third countries, this was the first request of this kind from the Western Balkans. The EMCDDA Management Board welcomed the initiative in June 2018, mandating the Director to launch negotiations on the WA with the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection. While in Tirana, Mr Goosdeel and Deputy Ministers Lamallari and Rakacolli will conclude the negotiations on the final draft agreement. The European Commission is expected to deliver its formal opinion on the draft text in the coming months. Following this opinion, the EMCDDA Management Board will be in a position to give its seal of approval on the WA. Among others, the new agreement will provide for the exchange of expertise and will contribute to developing drug data-collection and reporting capacity in the country. Albania is one of six candidate and potential candidate countries to the EU currently receiving assistance under the EMCDDA-IPA6 project, which kicked off in July 2017 and will run until June 2019.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/emcdda-and-republic-albania-strengthen-their-cooperation_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0168	2018-09-28	UNK	Two new synthetic opioids to be placed under control across the EU 	 Today, the European Union has decided to subject two new synthetic opioids to control measures across the 28 Member States. The implementing decision of the Council of the EU (1), based on a proposal from the European Commission, was adopted in the final stage of the three-step legal procedure designed to respond to new psychoactive substances (NPS) that may pose public health and social threats (2)(3). The substances, which have been raising health concerns in Europe, are cyclopropylfentanyl and methoxyacetylfentanyl (4). Both are chemically related to fentanyl, the controlled drug widely used in medicine in pain management and anaesthesia. Harmful effects linked to the use of the two substances have been reported by the Member States through the EU Early Warning System (EWS), operated by the EMCDDA and Europol. Similar to other opioid analgesics, the most serious acute risk arising from their use is likely to be from respiratory depression (which can lead to apnoea, respiratory arrest and death). Naloxone is expected to work as an antidote to poisoning (5). Today’s decision is based on the findings of formal risk assessments of the substances, conducted by the extended EMCDDA Scientific Committee in March 2018, with participation of additional experts from the EU Member States, European Commission, Europol and the European Medicines Agency. The risk assessments explored the health and social risks of the drugs, as well as international trafficking and the involvement of organised crime (6). The decision states that the evidence available provides ‘sufficient ground for subjecting cyclopropylfentanyl and methoxyacetylfentanyl to control measures across the Union’. Reasons for the conclusion include: the similarity of the substances to fentanyl and the risks they pose. Available in the EU since at least June 2017, cyclopropylfentanyl has been detected in six EU Member States and Norway. At the time of the risk assessment, 78 deaths with confirmed exposure to the substance had been reported by two EU Member States (Sweden and the UK). Methoxyacetylfentanyl has been available on the EU drug market since at least November 2016 and has been detected in 11 EU Member States and Norway. At the time of the risk assessment, 13 deaths with confirmed exposure to the substance had been reported by four EU Member States (Belgium, Czech Republic, Sweden and the UK). The two substances, sold online in powder form, are also available as ready-to-use nasal sprays. These new dosage forms are both easier to obtain and to consume and have the potential to make use of fentanils more socially acceptable (7). Cyclopropylfentanyl has been detected in tablets, among these falsified benzodiazepines (e.g. fake Xanax®) and opioid painkillers (e.g. fake OxyContin®). This increases the risk of poisoning in unsuspecting users. A small number of fentanils (e.g. fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil and remifentanil) are used legitimately in human and veterinary medicine. But fentanils also have a long history of illicit use as replacements for heroin and other controlled opioids. Over the past few years, there has been a large increase in the availability of fentanils in the United States, Canada and Europe. The EMCDDA is currently monitoring 32 fentanils through the EU EWS on new psychoactive substances (8); all of these have been detected on the EU drug market since 2012. Of the nine risk assessments carried out by the EMCDDA in 2017, five were related to synthetic opioids (acryloylfentanyl, furanylfentanyl, 4-fluoroisobutyrylfentanyl (4F-iBF), tetrahydrofuranylfentanyl (THF-F) and carfentanil) (9). All five substances are now controlled internationally under the United Nations 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. Following publication of today’s decision on cyclopropylfentanyl and methoxyacetylfentanyl in the Official Journal of the European Union, the EU Member States will have one year to introduce the controls into their national legislation. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/6/council-implementing-decision-to-control-cyclopropylfentanyl-and-methoxyacetylfentanyl_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0169	2018-09-25	UNK	EMCDDA at 3rd Inter-sessional meeting of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs	 Today, EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel is addressing the 3rd Inter-sessional meeting of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) in Vienna. The four-day meeting will focus on: demand reduction; access to controlled substances for medical and scientific purposes; cross-cutting issues, such as human rights; and preparations for the next CND session (March 2019). Mr Goosdeel is speaking on the first day of the meeting, which is dedicated to demand reduction and related measures. Among the topics covered during this session will be: reducing and preventing drug dependence; treating drug use disorders; and reducing drug-related health and social risks (e.g. HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis). At the meeting, Mr Goosdeel will showcase Europe’s comprehensive responses to drug problems, including the high levels of treatment provision to those in need. In 2016, 1.3 million people were in drug treatment, 628 000 of these receiving opioid substitution treatment (OST). The Director will also describe how Europe’s experience in rolling out evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions has been successfully complemented by the establishment of effective harm-reduction approaches in European countries. For example, the widespread distribution of sterile injecting equipment and, more recently, the increasing provision of the overdose antidote naloxone, helps reduce the spread of infectious diseases and prevent drug-related deaths among citizens. Over the last decade in Europe, the number of new HIV notifications among people who inject drugs has more than halved and mortality among clients in OST has reduced. Nominated by the EU and speaking for the Western European and Others Group (WEOG) at the UN, Mr Goosdeel will place special emphasis on the role of evidence in the development of European drug policy and on the sharing of best practice. The meeting will go on to discuss ways of strengthening data-collection systems, another area where the EMCDDA is expected to make a valuable contribution. Programme in brief Day I: Demand reduction and related measures Day II: Ensuring the availability of, and access to, controlled substances exclusively for medical and scientific purposes, while preventing their diversion Day III: Cross-cutting issues: drugs, human rights, youth, children, women and communities Day IV: Preparations for the ministerial segment to be held during the 62ndsession of the CND. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/emcdda-at-un-commission-on-narcotic-drugs_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0170	2018-09-19	UNK	EMCDDA at 7th International Symposium on Hepatitis Care in Substance Users	 This week, the EMCDDA is participating in the 7th International Symposium on Hepatitis Care in Substance Users, organised by the International Network for Hepatitis in Substance Users (INHSU). The event, running from 19–21 September in Cascais, is exploring the latest advances in hepatitis C epidemiology, management and treatment of viral hepatitis among people who use drugs, with a specific focus on hepatitis C. The EMCDDA is represented on the conference programme committee and is among the event supporters. Delegates from around the world include: health professionals, researchers, community organisations, people who use drugs and policymakers. Transmitted through the sharing of needles, syringes and other injecting equipment, hepatitis C is the most common infectious disease among people who inject drugs in Europe. Failure to address HCV infection in this group could mean considerable costs in the future, both to individuals and to health budgets The symposium programme covers: Day 1: Policy, epidemiology and public health Day 2: HCV diagnosis, linkage to care and treatment Day 3: HCV treatment and access During the inaugural session, which focused on the theme ‘How do we work together to achieve HCV elimination among people who inject drugs?’, EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel delivered an opening address from the agency. Mr Goosdeel made the link to EMCDDA Strategy 2025, which states that the agency ‘has an important responsibility to act as a catalyst for improving the quality and delivery of responses to reduce the health and social consequences associated with drug use. This requires the agency to keep abreast of new prevention, treatment and harm-reduction approaches. Special attention will be given to developing resources in areas where drugs have a significant impact on European public health, such as hepatitis C prevention and treatment, and overdose deaths’. Mr Goosdeel further presented the strategic vision for the EMCDDA that is ‘to contribute to a healthier and more secure Europe by providing evidence for better decisions and actions, healthier and more secure for everyone leaving in Europe, including for persons who use drugs’. He concluded his intervention by declaring that: ’It is time for change, time to move from knowledge to policy, and from policy to practice’. ‘Integration of HCV, other co-infections and harm reduction services’ will be discussed at a session sponsored by the European ‘Consumers, Health, Agriculture and Food’ Executive Agency (Chafea). Here the EMCDDA will speak on ‘How EU agencies are taking an integrated approach to hepatitis C control’. In an EMCDDA-sponsored session, experts will look at ‘Monitoring the elimination of HCV as a public health threat among PWID in the EU’. In a plenary session on the second conference day, results of an EMCDDA-funded study on the topic: ‘Do national HCV policies in the EU address treatment and care for people who inject drugs?’ will be presented. Also showcased will be posters on ‘European evidence-based guidance on prevention and control of HCV in prison settings’, based on joint ECDC–EMCDDA work and on ’Barriers to HCV Testing in Drug Treatment Services for People who Inject Drugs’, based on an EMCDDA-funded study carried out by Robert Koch Institute in Berlin. Finally, the EMCDDA will display a selection of its publications at the Chafea stand in the exhibition area. Speaking earlier this year on World Hepatitis Day (28 July), Alexis Goosdeel said: ‘I believe that we now have an opportunity to make real and sustained progress in this area. By combining treatment with adequate prevention and harm-reduction measures, including scaling up HCV testing to reach the undiagnosed, we have the necessary tools to control the epidemic. Through its Strategy 2025, the EMCDDA contributes to a healthier Europe by promoting the delivery of such responses’. The elimination of hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 (90% reduction in incidence; 65% in mortality ) is a goal of the first Global health sector strategy on viral hepatitis 2016–2021, endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2016. Through dissemination of scientific knowledge, the symposium aims to contribute to this WHO goal. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/international-symposium-hepatitis_en

The purpose of the meeting was to explore possible cooperation between the EMCDDA and the forum. Founded by the Council of Europe in 1987, EFUS is a network of some 250 local and regional authorities from 16 countries. Among its aims are to: promote a balanced vision of urban security; support local and regional authorities in conceiving, implementing and evaluating their local security policies; and help local elected officials gain recognition for their role in developing and implementing national and European policies. Mr Demeyer has been Mayor of Liège since 1999. His former roles include: member of the Walloon Regional Parliament (2004–2005); Vice-President of the Belgian Senate (2009–2017) and member of the Chamber of Representatives (2014–2017). He is currently member of the Commission investigating the terrorist attacks of March 2016 in Belgium and is Vice-President of the International Association of Francophone Mayors. Mr Goosdeel presented the agency’s ongoing activities under the EMCDDA Strategy 2025, which is built on the two pillars of health and security. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/emcdda-director-meets-president-european-forum-for-urban-security_en

The day unites patient organisations, governments, medical professionals, civil society, industry and the general public to boost the global profile of viral hepatitis. This year, the WHO will focus on the theme: ‘Test. Treat. Hepatitis’ affirming that timely testing and treatment of viral hepatitis B and C can save lives. Speaking ahead of the occasion, EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘Transmitted through the sharing of needles, syringes and other injecting equipment, hepatitis C is the most common infectious disease among people who inject drugs in Europe.

The elimination of hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 — namely a 90% reduction in new infections and a cut in mortality of 65% over the 15-year period leading up to 2030 — are core targets of the first Global health sector strategy on viral hepatitis 2016–2021, endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2016. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/world-hepatitis-day-2018_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0173	2018-07-23	UNK	Preventing blood-borne viruses in prison settings: ECDC and EMCDDA guidance	 People in prison experience a higher burden of communicable diseases such as hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV often linked to a history of injecting drug use. In addition, incarceration can result in a higher risk of transmission of communicable diseases, due to factors such as overcrowding, poor healthcare facilities and delayed diagnosis. In their joint public health guidance published today at AIDS 2018, ECDC and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) outline evidence-based and effective measures to help prevent and control the transmission of blood-borne viruses in prison settings. In the 31 countries of the European Union and European Economic Area, more than half a million people are held in a custodial facility on any given day. Incarceration represents an opportunity to address the healthcare needs of those people in prison who belong to hard-to-reach groups in the community, such as people who inject drugs. Delivering health protection, prevention and harm reduction programmes in prisons will not only benefit the prison population but, by targeting ‘high transmission’ networks, can also reduce the future risk of transmission in the community. ’The prevention and control of blood borne viruses among this particularly vulnerable population are important to improve their health and to stop the on-going transmission of viral hepatitis or HIV. Our joint guidance provides a valuable resource for planners and providers of healthcare in prisons to help them to address this specific public health issue’, says ECDC Director Andrea Ammon. The guidance is presented today at the 22nd International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2018) in Amsterdam and ahead of World Hepatitis Day on 28 July. ‘Providing high-quality health services in prison settings is effective because it helps us reach groups that are medically under-served in the community, including people who use drugs. Our new joint guidance highlights how achieving good prison health can contribute to improving public health and bring benefits for the wider community, such as reducing the transmission of drug-related infectious diseases’, adds EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel. The ECDC–EMCDDA guidance is based on a series of comprehensive reviews and analyses of the published literature and consultation with a scientific expert panel. It identifies the most (cost-) effective approaches with the aim to interrupt transmission in, and between, prison settings as well as the community. With this new guidance, the agencies continue their joint efforts to promote evidence-based practices in the field of prevention and care of communicable infectious diseases, to tackle in particular the high levels of transmission of blood-borne viruses among people who use drugs. Published alongside today’s ECDC–EMCDDA public health guidance are the underlying systematic review and a ’Guidance in brief’, providing a summary of selected findings. The key conclusions of the guidance regarding main actions for effective prevention and control of blood-borne viruses (BBV) in prison settings are: Prevention Offer a comprehensie package of preventive measures to people in prison that meet the same national standards as those recommended for community settings. Evidence shows that also in prison settings, condoms and behavioural interventions promote safer sex. Evidence shows that opioid substitution treatment reduces illicit opioid use and risks related to equipment sharing and, when continued on release, provides protection from death caused by overdose. Evidence shows that the provision of clean drug injection equipment is possible in prison settings and can successfully contribute to a comprehensive programme to reduce BBV transmission. HBV vaccination Offer HBV vaccination to people in prison with unknown or negative serology. Evidence shows that using rapid schedules may result in a higher completion rate of the full schedule. Testing for viral hepatitis and HIV Actively offer BBV testing to all people in prison upon admission and throughout the time in prison. Evidence shows that pro-active provision of BBV testing leads to a higher uptake; health promotion and peer education have been shown to increase HIV testing uptake. Viral hepatitis and HIV treatment Offer appropriate treatment to individuals diagnosed with HIV, HBV or HCV infection in prison settings, in line with the guidelines applied in the community and meeting the same provision standards as in the community. Evidence shows that treatment of BBV infections is feasible and effective in prison. Continuity of care Actively support and ensure continuity of care between prison and community. Evidence shows that release from prison is a key barrier to continuity and adherence to drug and infectious diseases treatment. Evidence shows that collaboration and partnership between prison and community health-care services promote and facilitate uninterrupted care. Evidence shows that active referral to external services improves treatment adherence. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/preventing-blood-borne-viruses-prison-settings_en

In a wide-ranging meeting, the two Directors discussed the EMCDDA Strategy 2025 — particularly activities related to achieving the goal of a 'more secure Europe' — and a new working arrangement between the EMCDDA and Europol, due to be signed in the autumn. The first cooperation agreement between the two agencies was signed in 2001 and was reinforced in 2005. Also under discussion were drug-related cross-border threats and cooperation in the broader setting of Justice and Home Affairs. The latter covers areas such as police cooperation and civil protection and includes working with CEPOL, the EU agency for law-enforcement training. The meeting included the co-signing of the joint EMCDDA–Europol 2017 Annual Report on the implementation of Council Decision 2005/387/JHA on the information exchange, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances, due to be published later this month. An important product of the existing partnership between the two agencies is the joint EU Drug Markets Report, a comprehensive strategic overview of drug markets in Europe, the third edition of which will be published in 2019. The Directors discussed progress in its preparation. Catherine De Bolle was appointed Europol Executive Director on 8 March this year and officially took up her hew role in May.

EMCDDA_UNK_0175	2018-07-04	UNK	Uruguay reports on regulated cannabis growing and sales	 In Uruguay, the Institute for Regulation and Control of Cannabis (IRCCA) released a report on the national regulated market, based on data up to 5 June 2018. After the market was legalised in 2013, resident users could register for only one of three ways to obtain cannabis: home growing, communal growing (social club), or buying state-grown cannabis from pharmacies (which only started to sell the drug in July 2017). Cannabis sold in pharmacies initially had a potency of 2.5 % THC and 6-7 % CBD, though this changed in December 2017 to 9 % THC and 3 % CBD. It is sold in 5-gram sachets for UY$200 [EUR 5.80], and users may buy 40 grams per month. As of June 2018, some 958 kilograms of cannabis had been sold in this way. Who is buying? Uruguay has a population of 3.5 million. The report shows that 35 246 people are registered to obtain cannabis; 8 583 by home growing, 24 324 for pharmacy purchases and 2 339 as members of 91 clubs (averaging 26 members per club). About three-quarters (18 981, or 78 %) of those registered for pharmacy purchase have actually made purchases. Comparing these numbers to a 2014 population survey of cannabis use, it is estimated that 24 % of those who had used the drug in the previous year in Uruguay get their cannabis from the legal market. However, IRCCA estimates that each home-grower and club member shares with two other users, and each pharmacy buyer shares with one, and in this way the policy reaches some 55 % of the users in the country. Males account for 73 % of the pharmacy purchasers and 76 % of the home-growers. Around 80 % of those registered for home grow or pharmacy purchases are aged between 18 and 44, with home-growers slightly older on average. Around two-thirds of those registered for pharmacy purchase are in employment. Is cannabis available everywhere? Eight out of 19 regions in the country have pharmacies selling cannabis. The region of the capital city, Montevideo, accounted for 57 % of the registrations for cannabis sold in pharmacies, as well as 45 % of the clubs, but only 32 % of the home-growers.

EMCDDA_UNK_0176	2018-06-25	UNK	Seventh European drugs summer school kicks off in Lisbon with record number of students	" The seventh European drugs summer school (EDSS) — ‘Illicit drugs in Europe: demand, supply and public policies’ — opens today in Lisbon on the eve of International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking. The two-week course (25 June–6 July), is a joint initiative of the EMCDDA and the University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL) and is supported by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). This year, the EDSS has reached its maximum capacity with a record 53 participants from some 25 countries from the EU, Africa, Asia and the Americas. Through a multidisciplinary and interactive approach to the drugs problem, EMCDDA scientific experts, leading academics, guest speakers and policymakers, will prepare participants to meet the complex policy challenges in this field, both in Europe and beyond.  Keynote speakers this year include: Robert West, editor-in-chief of the journal Addiction; Mariann Skar, Secretary-General of the European Alcohol Policy Alliance; Annemie Coone, Lecturer at the Hogeschool Gent and the European Prevention Curriculum; Sabrina Molinaro of the Italian National Research Council and João Goulão, the Portuguese national drugs coordinator. Welcoming the students to the summer school and introducing the work and role of the agency will be EMCDDA Director, Alexis Goosdeel. A focus on prevention The focus of the 2018 summer school will be on drug prevention approaches. The EMCDDA Strategy 2025 underlines the role of the agency as a catalyst for supporting practice by improving the quality and delivery of responses to reduce the health and social consequences associated with drug use. This requires it to keep abreast of new prevention, treatment and harm-reduction approaches. As the 2018 European Drug Report reveals: ‘Interest in the implementation of evidence-based prevention programmes in Europe has been increasing in recent years, supported by the establishment of registries, training initiatives and quality standards…Professional training is vital for the successful introduction of prevention approaches’.  Speaking today in Lisbon, EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel said: ‘I am delighted to open our seventh European drugs summer school and to welcome a record number of participants and speakers for two weeks of lively debate around the central theme of drug prevention. This theme is particularly relevant at a time when there is growing awareness that a properly trained prevention workforce is a crucial factor for translating prevention evidence into practice. It is essential that professionals working with young people are appropriately trained’. Goosdeel adds: ‘Today the United Nations promotes its Listen FIRST campaign to support evidence-based prevention interventions as an investment in the wellbeing of children, young people, their families and communities. Through careful listening, parents, teachers, policymakers and prevention workers can play a vital role in reducing the development of drug use and risky behaviours’.  In 2017, the EMCDDA launched Xchange, a European online registry of evidence-based prevention programmes, providing information on the effectiveness and the implementability of programmes in European countries. This enables decision-makers to assess the ease with which prevention programmes can be implemented in different social, cultural and organisational contexts.  In October this year, the EMCDDA will partner with the European Society for Prevention Research for a conference focusing on ‘Prevention technologies — improving the use of evidence in prevention practice’. The event will look at the challenges in the field of drug prevention today and address how new technologies might offer fresh opportunities for delivering evidence-based interventions and programmes and provide a platform for better engagement across different sectors.  The EMCDDA marks International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking with an event on 25 June at its premises for the Lisbon diplomatic community and its partners from the Portuguese authorities. EDSS programme Week 1 of the summer school will feature lectures on: drug policies (concepts, issues and analysis); the EU drug strategy; drug laws and public expenditure and the global burden of drug-related problems. This session will also focus on the EMCDDA epidemiological indicators and how they inform drug policy. Participation from practitioners from hospitals and prison services will enrich the debate. Week 2 will focus on drug markets in Europe and will provide an insight into prevention approaches in demand-reduction interventions. A dedicated session will explore harm-reduction interventions with a specific focus on current drug consumption room experiences in Europe. It will close with an analysis of the link between evidence and decision-making and an open debate. Study visits to outreach facilities and to the Portuguese commissions for dissuasion will be organised over the two weeks. During the course, students will also participate in interactive workshops to discuss their own projects and views. A concluding open debate will be held by the Portuguese national drug coordinator, João Goulão. The target audiences for the EDSS are: university students, researchers, professionals and administrators interested in working on drug issues. Profiles of former alumni and their testimonials can be found on the official summer school website and their statements viewed in a promotional video.

EMCDDA_UNK_0177	2018-06-07	UNK	EMCDDA publishes latest insights into NPS in Europe	 In a new update from the EU Early Warning System (EWS) on new psychoactive substances (NPS) (1), the EMCDDA releases today its latest insights in this area entitled Fentanils and synthetic cannabinoids: driving greater complexity into the drug situation. This is the second update from the EU Early Warning System. In these publications, the EMCDDA aims to provide some insights into what is happening with new psychoactive substances in Europe, based on data from the agency’s early warning and risk assessment activities. This issue covers the period from January 2016 until December 2017, with aggregated data on seizures reported by law enforcement limited to 2016 data. A focus of this publication is the new fentanils (which form the large majority of the new synthetic opioids that have been reported in Europe) and the synthetic cannabinoids. Since the previous publication, in March 2015, there have been a number of major developments in Europe (EMCDDA, 2015). Some of these are encouraging. The number of new substances reported for the first time each year during 2016 and 2017 has fallen by around 40 % compared with 2015. Much of this is related to a decrease in the number of new synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic cathinones appearing each year. In part, this may reflect the results of sustained efforts to control new substances in Europe, including their open sale as ‘legal highs’ on the high street. Law enforcement operations in China leading to the closure of laboratories making these substances might be another reason. Other developments are less encouraging. The analysis presented here suggests that the availability of many new substances remains relatively high and, in places, stronger links are developing with the established illicit drug market. It also appears that there is increasing interest from crime groups in making new substances, such as synthetic cathinones, in Europe. Another major challenge in the last few years has been the large number of highly potent new substances that have appeared on the market. These pose a high risk of life-threatening poisoning to users and are capable of causing explosive outbreaks that can overwhelm local healthcare systems. In some circumstances, law enforcement and laboratory personnel may be at risk of poisoning from occupational exposure. These substances are also easier to conceal and smuggle, with a few grams sufficient to make many thousands of doses for the drug market. Given the globalised nature of the market, these substances can pose a serious cross-border threat to health. Currently, two groups that particularly stand out in this respect are the new synthetic opioids (particularly the fentanils) and the synthetic cannabinoids. The report underlines the importance of continued investment in strong EU and national early-warning systems as well as a more rapid risk-assessment process at EU level to protect the health and security of people living in Europe. A new EU legislative framework, coming into force later this year, will play a central role in achieving these aims. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/emcdda-publishes-latest-insights-into-nps-in-europe_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0178	2018-06-07	UNK	EMCDDA: resurgence of cocaine in a dynamic drug market	 Evidence of increased cocaine availability is highlighted by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) today in its European Drug Report 2018: Trends and Developments released in Brussels (1). The development occurs in the context of a dynamic drug market which is able to adapt rapidly in response to drug control measures. In its annual overview, the agency also explores challenges associated with new psychoactive substances (NPS), including: the availability of new synthetic opioids (particularly highly potent fentanyl derivatives); and problems associated with the use of synthetic cannabinoids in marginalised groups (including the prison population). The EMCDDA report notes that, across the board, drug availability is high and, in some areas, appears to be increasing. Latest figures show that in Europe (EU-28, Turkey and Norway) over 1 million seizures of illicit drugs were reported in 2016. Over 92 million adults in the EU (15–64 years) have tried an illicit drug in their lifetime and an estimated 1.3 million people received treatment for illicit drug use in 2016 (EU-28). Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, says: ‘We are seeing higher drug production and availability in Europe today. On top of that, the illicit drug market is highly dynamic and adaptable — and therefore all the more dangerous. If we want to stay ahead of the game, our efforts must focus on building both resilience and responsiveness, not least because of the growing importance of the online market and the development of new types of drugs. With the new rules on new psychoactive substances entering into force by the end of the year, Europe will be equipped with additional, stronger tools to tackle those challenges more effectively and better protect European citizens against dangerous drugs.’ (2) Cocaine: increased availability and highest purity in a decade Infographic, p. 26 Figure 1.6 Cocaine is the most commonly used illicit stimulant drug in Europe. Around 2.3 million young adults (15–34 years) have used the drug in the last year (EU-28). Against a backdrop of signs of rising coca cultivation and cocaine production in Latin America, today’s analysis confirms that Europe’s cocaine market is buoyant, with indicators now pointing to increased availability of the drug in a number of countries. Although the price of cocaine remained stable, its purity at street level reached its highest level in a decade in 2016 (Infographic, p. 26). The number of cocaine seizures has also risen. Some 98 000 seizures of the drug were reported in the EU in 2016 (90 000 in 2015), amounting to 70.9 tonnes (Figure 1.6). Figure 2.5 At city level, a recent study of drug residues in municipal wastewater revealed that, between 2015 and 2017, there was an increase in cocaine residues in 26 of the 31 cities with data for that period (3). The highest traces were recorded in cities in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK, with low levels reported in the eastern European cities studied (Figure 2.5). Infographic, p. 45 Figure 3.7 Today’s report reveals a rise in the number of first-time admissions to specialised treatment relating to cocaine (Infographic, p. 45). In 2016, 30 300 clients entered treatment for the first time for problems with this drug, over a fifth more than in 2014. In total, over 67 000 clients entered specialised treatment for cocaine-related problems in 2016. Of particular concern are the estimated 8 300 clients who entered treatment for primary crack cocaine use in 2016. Furthermore, cocaine was the second most common drug to be reported in drug-related hospital emergency presentations in a network of 19 sentinel hospitals in 2016 (Euro-DEN Plus)(Figure 3.7). Trafficking methods and routes also appear to be changing. The Iberian Peninsula — historically the main entry point for maritime shipments of cocaine into Europe — though still important, appears less prominent in the 2016 data, with large seizures now reported in container ports further north. In 2016, Belgium seized 30 tonnes of cocaine (43% of the annual estimated total amount of cocaine seized in the EU). EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘The findings from our new report indicate that Europe is now experiencing the consequences of increased cocaine production in Latin America. Early warnings from wastewater analysis about rising cocaine availability are now supported by other data suggesting growing supply, including increases in purity and in the number and quantity of cocaine seizures. We must be concerned about the health implications of cocaine use as we are beginning to see some worrying developments in this area, including a larger number of people entering treatment for the first time for cocaine problems. These changes underline the growing importance of providing effective prevention, treatment and harm-reduction interventions for cocaine users’. Signs of increased drug production inside Europe Europe is an important market for illicit drugs, which are trafficked in from a number of world regions, including Latin America, West Asia and North Africa. However, today’s report also highlights the role of Europe as a producing region, noting that: ‘This year, for a wide range of substances, we are seeing some worrying signs of increased levels of drug production now taking place within Europe’. Production takes place closer to consumer markets for a number of reasons, including: convenience; reducing the risk of detection at borders; and, depending on the drug, the availability or cost of essential chemicals needed in the production process. The report notes several examples of increased drug production inside Europe and innovation in production methods. These include evidence of: illicit laboratories processing cocaine; an increase in the number of MDMA (‘ecstasy’) laboratories dismantled; the scaling up of, and greater organised crime involvement in, methamphetamine production; the final phases of amphetamine production taking place in the country of consumption; and, a small number of heroin production laboratories detected. Some of the synthetic drugs produced in the EU are destined for external markets such as the Americas, Australia, the Middle and Far East and Turkey. Increased production of high potency cannabis within Europe appears to have impacted on the activities of cannabis producers located outside of the EU, as seen by the higher potency of cannabis resin trafficked into Europe from Morocco. There are also signs that NPS, commonly produced in China and shipped to Europe for packaging, are sometimes manufactured within European borders. Cannabis: availability and use remain high and changing international policies may bring challenges to Europe Cannabis remains the most widely used illicit drug in Europe, its prominence evident in data on prevalence, drug law offences, seizures and new treatment demands. Some 17.2 million young Europeans (15–34 years) have used cannabis in the last year (EU-28) and around 1% of European adults (15–64 years) are daily or almost daily users (EU-28). Figure 1.14 Infographic, p.41 Cannabis was involved in over three-quarters (77%) of the 800 000 drug use or possession offences reported in the EU in 2016 for which the primary drug is known (Figure 1.14). It is also the most seized drug, with 763 000 seizures of cannabis products reported in the EU in 2016. Cannabis is responsible for the greatest share (45%) of new entrants to drug treatment in Europe (EU-28, Turkey and Norway). The number of first-time entrants for cannabis problems rose from 43 000 in 2006 to 75 000 in 2016 in the 25 countries with data for both years (Infographic, p.41). Recent changes in the regulatory framework for cannabis in parts of the Americas — including legalisation in some jurisdictions — have led to the rapid emergence in these locations of a commercial, recreational cannabis market. This is resulting in innovation in delivery systems and in cannabis product development (e.g. e-liquids, edible products and high potency strains). It is unclear what the implications for Europe will be if a large legal market for this drug develops in parts of the Americas, but an impact on patterns of supply or use in Europe cannot be ruled out. The EMCDDA is monitoring international developments in cannabis regulation closely to facilitate a more informed understanding of the changes taking place and help identify any impact they may have on the European situation (4). Among the policy issues receiving greater attention in the context of changing international perspectives on cannabis regulation is that of cannabis use and impaired driving. This is the focus of a recent EMCDDA report drawing on insights from international experts (5). Fewer new psychoactive substances detected but more evidence of harms Figure 1.10 New psychoactive substances (NPS/’new drugs’) remain a considerable policy and public health challenge in Europe. Not covered by international drug controls, NPS comprise a range of substances, including synthetic cannabinoids, opioids, cathinones and benzodiazepines (Figure 1.10). In 2017, 51 NPS were reported for the first time to the EU Early Warning System (EWS) — a rate of around one per week. Although the annual total number of new substances making their debut on the market is down on the peak years — 98 in 2015, 101 in 2014 — the overall number of NPS available remains high. By the end of 2017, the EMCDDA was monitoring over 670 NPS (compared with around 350 in 2013)(6). Health harms linked to new synthetic cannabinoids and new synthetic opioids — including acute intoxications and deaths — prompted the EMCDDA to conduct an unprecedented nine risk assessments in 2017. Figure 1.12 New synthetic cannabinoids, 179 of which have been detected since 2008 (10 in 2017), represent the largest chemical group monitored by the EMCDDA. Often sold as ‘herbal smoking mixtures’, they were the most frequently seized NPS in 2016, with just over 32 000 seizures reported (compared with 10 000 seizures in 2015)(Figure 1.12). This accounted for nearly half of the total number of seizures of NPS reported to the agency in 2016. Four synthetic cannabinoids were risk assessed in 2017 (AB-CHMINACA, ADB-CHMINACA, 5F-MDMB-PINACA and CUMYL-4CN-BINACA). Highly potent new synthetic opioids (particularly fentanyl derivatives), which mimic the effects of naturally derived opiates (e.g. heroin and morphine) are increasingly detected. These are sometimes available in novel forms (e.g. nasal sprays) or are sold as, or mixed with, illicit drugs, such as heroin or cocaine. A total of 38 new synthetic opioids have been detected on Europe’s drug market since 2009 (13 in 2017). Fentanyl derivatives, key players in the current US opioid crisis, merit continued concern and vigilance in Europe. These substances — some many times more potent than morphine — accounted for over 70% of the estimated 1 600 seizures of new synthetic opioids reported in 2016. Ten new fentanyl derivatives were reported through the EWS in 2017, five of which were risk assessed (acryloylfentanyl, furanylfentanyl, 4-fluoroisobutyrylfentanyl, tetrahydrofuranylfentanyl and carfentanil). Prisons: focus on healthcare and new drugs Prisons are a critical setting for addressing the healthcare needs of drug users and doing so can bring benefits to the wider community (e.g. preventing overdose after release; reducing the transmission of drug-related infectious diseases, such as HIV and HCV). This year’s report highlights the opportunities for intervening in this setting and draws attention to the national variability in the provision of services (7). In a new multi-country study published alongside today’s report (8), the agency investigates the growing health and security issues raised by the use of NPS in prison. ‘NPS use and related harms are now an important new challenge for the prison system in Europe’, states the study. Of the four main types of NPS found in prisons, synthetic cannabinoids are the most reported. Important drivers for their use in prisons include the ease with which they can be smuggled (e.g. liquefied and sprayed onto paper or textiles) and the difficulty in detecting them in drug tests. Internet sales and the emergence of new benzodiazepines While overall, in terms of volume, traditional offline drug markets still predominate, online markets appear to be of growing importance, posing a new challenge for drug control measures. A recent EMCDDA–Europol study identified over 100 global darknet markets, on which around two-thirds of purchases were drug-related (9). The surface web and social media also appear to be growing in importance, especially regarding the supply of NPS and access to misused medicines. Timeline of the reporting of new benzodiazepines to the EMCDDA Today’s report raises concern over the emergence, on the street and online, of new benzodiazepines, not authorised as medicines in the EU. The EMCDDA is currently monitoring 23 new benzodiazepines (3 detected for the first time in Europe in 2017). Some are sold under their own names (e.g. diclazepam, etizolam, flubromazolam, flunitrazolam, fonazepam). In other cases, producers use these substances to manufacture fake versions of commonly prescribed benzodiazepine medicines (e.g. diazepam, alprazolam), which are then sold on the illicit market. In 2016, over half a million tablets containing new benzodiazepines, or similar substances, were seized, some two-thirds up on the number seized in 2015. In an analysis published alongside today’s report, the EMCDDA explores the misuse of benzodiazepines among high-risk opioid users in Europe (10). While much prescribing of these medicines to high-risk drug users is done with legitimate therapeutic aims in mind, they may be diverted and misused, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality in this group. Around 40% of those entering treatment for primary opioid use, reported benzodiazepines as their secondary problem drug. The study includes a timeline of the reporting of new benzodiazepines to the EMCDDA. Rising overdose deaths and the role of naloxone in prevention Today’s report highlights concern over the high number of drug overdose deaths in Europe, which has been rising over the last four years. Over 9 000 overdose deaths, mainly related to heroin and other opioids — although often combined with other substances, particularly alcohol and benzodiazepines — are estimated to have occurred in Europe in 2016 (EU-28, Turkey and Norway). The challenges posed by old and new opioids place a renewed focus on the role of the opioid antidote naloxone in overdose response strategies (11). The report underlines the urgent need to ‘review current naloxone policies and increase training and awareness-raising for both drug users and professionals who may encounter these drugs’. Chair of the EMCDDA Management Board Laura d’Arrigo concludes: ‘The threats posed by drugs to public health and security in Europe continue to require a united response. The EU action plan on drugs, adopted in 2017, provides the framework for European cooperation. As drug problems shift and new trends appear, it is crucial that our monitoring system keeps pace. The European Drug Report, along with 30 country reports, provide the latest analysis to help decision-makers gain a clear picture of the phenomenon and adapt the political response to prevent and face emerging challenges’.

EMCDDA_UNK_0179	2018-06-01	UNK	EMCDDA Director visits IN-Mouraria harm-reduction centre	 This week, EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel and members of his staff have been visiting IN-Mouraria, a low-threshold harm-reduction centre based in Lisbon. In 2019, the centre will become a managing partner of one of the new drug consumption rooms (DCRs) to be implemented in the capital by the Lisbon Town Hall. The centre is supported by the Portuguese Group of Activists on HIV Treatments (GAT), a community-based NGO advocating for the interests of people living with HIV and viral hepatitis and providing essential services to a range of marginalised groups in downtown Lisbon. IN-Mouraria offers a number of free, confidential services, including: basic healthcare; drop-in opportunities (with peer support and access to food, clothes, hygiene, telephone and internet); rapid testing for HIV, hepatitis B and C and syphilis; referrals to infectious disease clinics and other social services; distribution of injecting and smoking materials (syringes, crack pipes, foil) and safer use education. A key feature of IN-Mouraria are its peer-led activities and research competence. Through workshops, presentations and other initiatives, peer educators (who use or have used drugs) perform harm-reduction interventions (e.g. safer use education, drop-in management, escorting clients to health appointments). It is also an important research site for projects with EU partners, where new initiatives are started and experiences tested and evaluated. The visit followed an invitation by GAT to the EMCDDA Director and staff of the agency’s Public Health unit to learn about the daily work carried out at IN-Mouraria and the centre’s involvement in European research projects. The EMCDDA Strategy 2025 underlines the agency’s role in acting as a catalyst for improving quality and implementation of interventions and a focus is placed on the reduction of drug-related deaths and infections. The visit provided EMCDDA staff with a welcome opportunity to touch base with the latest developments in harm reduction at the local level. Next week, the EMCDDA will launch its European Drug Report 2018 in Brussels. Alongside the report, it will publish an updated review on drug consumption rooms. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/director-emcdda-visits-in-mouraria-harm-reduction-centre_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0180	2018-05-25	UNK	EMCDDA releases its first analysis on monitoring drug-related homicide in Europe	 An EMCDDA Paper released today provides an overview of the information available on drug-related homicide (DRH) in Europe. This first snapshot provides practitioners and policymakers with the current state of the art on this topic. It is part of the EMCDDA’s efforts to expand its monitoring in the drug-related crime area in order to fully comprehend the broader ramifications of the drugs phenomenon. Since 2013, the EMCDDA has been working on improving its framework for monitoring the supply side of the drugs problem to reflect the changing nature of drug markets and their wider harms and impact (1). The effects of drugs and drug markets reach beyond those who are directly exposed to drugs in terms of health or social problems. The issue is of serious concern in relation to the overall security situation in Europe and deeply affects communities at large, as drug use and drug markets can act as cross-cutting facilitators of acts of violence. Literature on the relationship between psychoactive substance use and violence is increasing, although most of this is devoted to the use of alcohol. However, a smaller, but growing, number of studies focus on the drug–violence relationship. To help bridge the gap, today’s report: maps existing data sources on homicide in European countries; estimates the extent of drug involvement in national homicides by country; assesses and discusses the obstacles where a drug-homicide relationship cannot be readily established; and considers the practical implications for monitoring drug-related homicide at the EU level. There are clearly inconsistencies in the data available on drug-related homicide in Europe. While 10 countries systematically prepare data on this topic, there is variation, between and within countries, on the role drugs play in homicide events. Homicides are internationally well-recorded, but as the report states: ‘Research and monitoring activity internationally has rarely looked beyond the link between homicide and the involvement of organised crime in the supply and distribution of illicit drugs’. According to the report, Europe currently faces four key obstacles to monitoring drug-related homicide: missing data; fragmented data; comparability issues; and data quality reservations. To overcome these obstacles there is a need to define and operationalise concepts based on common definitions and integrate them into the EMCDDA monitoring system. Drug-related homicide is one of the most serious manifestations of drug markets and has a high social cost. It can also be an indicator of wider drug-related violent crime. Comparing these statistics between countries can help identify trends and new threats in order to plan and implement proportionate responses. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/emcdda-releases-analysis-monitoring-drug-related-homicide-europe_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0181	2018-05-24	UNK	EMCDDA Director addresses Congress of the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists	 EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel will today address the 38th Congress of the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) taking place on 23 and 24 May in Bucharest. A key theme on the congress programme is the emergence of new psychoactive substances (NPS). In his presentation — ‘How clinical toxicologists and poisons centres contribute to addressing NPS in Europe’ — Mr Goosdeel will highlight the leading role played by the EU Early Warning System in detecting and responding to emerging threats in an ever-evolving drug situation and in a drug market which is highly dynamic and adaptable. Of particular concern is an online market supplying substances which pose new risks to drug users and public health. Strong early-warning systems are a key element in identifying new substances and their potential harms. One example is the adulteration of established drugs (such as heroin) with synthetic opioids, such as carfentanil, which poses a high risk of life-threatening poisoning. EAPCCT works to advance knowledge and understanding of all forms of poisoning, including drug poisoning. Working on the principle that sound information is the key to an effective strategy on drugs, the EMCDDA’s contribution to events of this kind helps to inform policymaking at national and Europe-wide level. Through its Strategy 2025 and Programming document 2018–20, the EMCDDA aims for a Europe equipped with strong tools to tackle the challenges of NPS effectively and better protect European citizens against dangerous drugs. During his visit, the Director will also meet Mr Sorin Oprea, Head of the National Antidrug Agency and EMCDDA Management Board member for Romania. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/emcdda-director-addresses-congress-european-association-poisons-centres-clinical-toxicologists_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0182	2018-05-23	UNK	Cannabis and driving: new briefing presents questions and answers for policymaking	 What is the impact of cannabis use on driving? Do edible and smoked cannabis products affect drivers in the same way? How should the law deal with drivers who take cannabis for medical reasons? These are among the questions addressed today in a new policy briefing on cannabis and driving, published by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA). With cannabis policy evolving internationally (1), cannabis-impaired driving has become an increasingly relevant issue. The new briefing aims to provide those concerned with policy in this field with an overview of the latest knowledge and developments. The briefing draws on the evidence presented at the Third international symposium on drug‑impaired driving, held in Lisbon on 23 October 2017. The event was a collaborative initiative of the EMCDDA, the CCSA, the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) International Program and the New Zealand Drug Foundation. Over 100 participants attended the event, which brought together researchers, practitioners and policy experts from over 30 countries. The briefing answers 15 questions grouped in four key areas addressed at the symposium: Challenges for regulatory models Drug screening, testing and detection Preventing cannabis-impaired driving Future perspectives for research and monitoring. The briefing looks at the usefulness of biological and behavioural tests in assessing cannabis-related impairment as well as the challenges they present. It describes how the effects of smoked cannabis differ from those of edible cannabis and discusses the complexities arising when drivers mix substances (e.g. cannabis and alcohol). The briefing also considers the various options available for responding to cannabis-positive drivers and the need to complement penalties with education countering young people’s misconceptions about the levels of risk involved. With cannabis use no longer illegal in some jurisdictions (be this for medical or recreational purposes), laws penalising cannabis-positive drivers may become similar to those penalising alcohol-positive drivers. For example, many countries are working towards laws that establish maximum permissible blood‑drug limits. As in the case with alcohol, these laws would mean that any driver ‘over the limit’ would be committing an offence and there would be no need to prove physical impairment. Whatever approach is chosen, ongoing evaluation will be crucial. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/4/cannabis-driving-new-briefing-presents-questions-answers-policymakers_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0183	2018-05-23	UNK	ECDC and EMCDDA make the case for active case finding of communicable diseases in prison	 What are the most (cost-) effective ways to prevent and control communicable diseases in prison settings? In their joint public health Guidance published today, ECDC and the EMCDDA present the evidence on active case finding as a key measure to diagnose communicable diseases early. The two agencies advise to actively offer testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV to all people in prison and to conduct universal testing for tuberculosis at prison entry. The Guidance provides scientific advice on different options for active case finding among people in prison in order to diagnose a range of communicable diseases early. For this, ECDC and the EMCDDA systematically retrieved and assessed the evidence on the effectiveness of active case finding interventions for blood-borne viruses, sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis in prison settings in the European Union and European Economic Area. Interrupting transmission with test-and-treat approach Compared to the general public, people in prison have a higher burden of communicable diseases such as hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV, syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and tuberculosis (TB). This constitutes a health risk for those living, and working, in prison settings as well as for the general population, given that the majority of people in prisons return to their communities after a short period of incarceration (median length of detention in Europe is less than nine months). The ECDC–EMCDDA Guidance is based on consultations with a panel of prison experts, and identifies the most (cost-) effective approaches with the aim to interrupt transmission in, and between, prison settings as well as the community, by first testing and then offering treatment to those infected. Full news release available on the ECDC website. Download Guidance and executive summary. ECDC and the EMCDDA welcome the efforts of European Hepatitis-HIV Testing Week to increase positive dialogue among those who might benefit from being tested and those who offer tests across Europe. The first spring edition of European Testing Week is currently underway (18–25 May 2018). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/ecdc-emcdda-communicable-diseases-prison_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0184	2018-05-15	UNK	EMCDDA Director addresses Lithuanian drug policy conference 	 EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel will address a conference hosted by the Lithuanian Drug, Tobacco and Alcohol Control Department (NTAKD) in Vilnius today, as the organisation prepares to present a new strategy (2018–2028) to the Lithuanian parliament and government. Dedicated to Lithuania’s drug policy review, with its human rights and health approach, the conference will underline the importance of a balanced and long-term drug policy, geared towards the creation of a healthy and safe society. Mr Goosdeel will present the EMCDDA’s current work — particularly its strategy for contributing to a healthier and more secure Europe — as well as highlights on Europe’s drug situation. The Director will place special emphasis on the need for cooperation in gathering information on the drug situation — embodied in the work of the agency’s Reitox network — which can contribute to informed policymaking. A central feature of the conference will be the presentation of the NTAKD’s new policy document and guidelines, which are intended to steer Lithuanian policymaking over the next decade. Other presentations will look at the examples of the drug policies of Portugal and the Czech Republic, outlining the impact of drug decriminalisation on drug use and public health and the importance and benefit of making harm-reduction measures available to drug users. The conference will also examine the role of the judicial system in tackling serious drug-related crime and will feature a presentation from Europol on the challenges posed by international organised crime. The EMCDDA works on the principle that sound information is the key to an effective strategy on drugs.

EMCDDA_UNK_0185	2018-05-14	UNK	Two new synthetic cannabinoids to be placed under control across the EU 	 Today the European Union has decided to subject two new synthetic cannabinoids to control measures across the 28 Member States (1). The implementing decisions of the Council of the EU (2), based on proposals by the European Commission, were adopted in the final stage of the three-step legal procedure designed to respond to new psychoactive substances (NPS) that may pose public health and social threats (3)(4). The substances in question are ADB-CHMINACA and CUMYL-4CN-BINACA, which have been raising health concerns in Europe. Harmful effects linked to the use of the two substances have been reported by the Member States through the EU Early Warning System (EWS), operated by the EMCDDA and Europol. Following publication of the decisions in the Official Journal of the European Union, the Member States will have one year to introduce the controls into national legislation. Today’s decisions are based on the findings of formal risk assessments of the substances, conducted by the extended EMCDDA Scientific Committee in November 2017, with participation of additional experts from the EU Member States, European Commission, Europol and the European Medicines Agency. The risk assessments assessed the health and social risks of the drugs, as well as international trafficking and the involvement of organised crime (5). Available in the EU since at least 2014, ADB-CHMINACA has been detected in 17 Member States, Turkey and Norway. At the time of the risk assessment, 13 deaths with confirmed exposure to the substance had been reported by three EU Member States (Germany, Hungary and Sweden). CUMYL-4CN-BINACA has been available on the EU drug market since at least 2015 and has been detected in 11 Member States and Turkey. At the time of the risk assessment, 11 deaths with confirmed exposure to the substances had been reported by two EU Member States (Hungary and Sweden). The two substances are typically found in herbal ‘smoking mixtures’ or in powder form, but other preparations are also available (e.g. blotters, e-liquids for vaping in e-cigarettes). Synthetic cannabinoids have similar effects to Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive substance in cannabis, but with additional life-threatening toxicity. Since around 2006, ‘legal high’ products containing synthetic cannabinoids have been sold in Europe and marketed as ‘legal’ replacements for cannabis. Of the nine risk assessments carried out by the EMCDDA in 2017, four were related to synthetic cannabinoids. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/3/council-implementing-decisions-control-adb-chminaca-cumyl-4cn-binaca_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0187	2018-04-13	UNK	Conclusions of the WHO international meeting on prisons and health, Lisbon 2017	 Drugs and drug-related harms continue to challenge prison systems in Europe and interventions in this setting must be driven by evidence gathered through monitoring, data-collection and research. The remarks come in conclusions published by the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe (WHO–Europe), in collaboration with Public Health England and the EMCDDA. The conclusions were adopted unanimously at the annual international conference on prisons and health, convened under WHO-Europe’s Health in Prison Programme (HIPP)(11–12 December 2017). Organised by WHO-Europe, with the support of Public Health England and the EMCDDA, the event addressed the needs of prisoners with drug-related problems (1). The conclusions represent a step forward in the prison health policy at European and international level. Experts attending the meeting, hosted by the EMCDDA, underlined the public health and social relevance of improving knowledge in this area and called for awareness-raising among policymakers, health and justice professionals and prison administrations on the need for effective interventions in this setting. Prisoners have higher rates of drug use and injecting than the general population and those with drug-related problems make up a significant proportion of the prison population. Among high-risk drug users in the community, over half report having been imprisoned more than once. Taking note of these facts and figures, and of the high rate of post-release mortality, the meeting recognised prisoners as a disadvantaged group in terms of health and wellbeing and acknowledged prisons as important settings to address health inequality and contribute to public health protection. In the conclusions, the experts acknowledge standards set out in the ‘United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners’ (‘Nelson Mandela Rules’, 2015), which represented an important advancement in human rights and access to healthcare for people living in prison. Rule 24 calls for the same standards of healthcare in the prison setting as in the wider community and continuity of care between the two. The conclusions call on policymakers, health and justice professionals and prison administrations to: implement a ‘whole-of-government approach’ to prison healthcare; operate within a framework of equivalence of healthcare between prison and community; treat the person as a whole, including physical and psychosocial support; recognise that drug treatment should take account of wider health and social care issues; ensure that service design is informed by research evidence; develop and agree minimum staffing levels; adopt the UN comprehensive package of services to address HIV, TB, and viral hepatitis B; undertake prison reform measures to improve the living and working conditions; and adopt and implement alternatives to conviction or punishment. Through this initiative, the participating organisations shared good practice, explored public health and health service delivery challenges in the prison setting and considered current scientific evidence to support policy and intervention. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/who-conclusions-meeting-prisons-health_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0188	2018-03-27	UNK	Dutch ministers outline 4-year trial to supply cannabis to coffeeshops	 This news item was published in the EMCDDA’s Cannabis drug policy news on 23.03.2018 Today cannabis is sold openly in 573 ‘coffeeshops’ operating in 103 of the 380 municipalities in the Netherlands. While local authorities have tolerated the sale of cannabis under certain conditions in these outlets for many years, the supply of the drug to the coffeeshops is not officially permitted. This has created an illicit market in cannabis production and wholesale distribution. In October 2017, the Dutch government declared its intention to permit an experiment on the legal supply of cannabis to coffeeshops to be carried out in up to ten medium to large-sized municipalities. The trial should examine impacts on public health, crime, public safety and nuisance, and the municipalities should be varied in size and location. On 9 March 2018, the minister of Justice and Security and the minister for Health, Welfare and Sport described the plans for this experiment in a letter to the Dutch parliament. The experiment is to be carried out in three phases: Preparation: entry into force of the law, designation of growers and municipalities, and a research consortium established; Experiment: a four-year period of production and delivery to coffeeshops; Completion: restoring the situation to how it was before, over about six months. An independent advisory committee, reporting by the end of May 2018, will help to define such details as how the cannabis is cultivated, monitoring and enforcement systems, and the criteria to select municipalities. The ministers’ letter to the parliament included several initial questions to the advisory committee. After the summer break, the committee will nominate the municipalities for selection. The draft law, required to allow deviation from the drug control act, will be presented to the parliament before the summer break. The draft has already been sent for consultation to key stakeholders including the association of municipalities, the college of attorneys general, and the council for the judiciary. The law will be accompanied by an order in council which will set out the more detailed requirement of cannabis cultivation and sales. The results of the trial will be independently evaluated. In the Netherlands, an estimated 16.1 % of young adults had used cannabis in the last year, compared with 13.3 % in Germany, 10.1 % in Belgium and 22.1 % in France.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/dutch-ministers-trial-supply-cannabis-coffeeshops_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0189	2018-03-19	UNK	Promoting evidence-based health decision-making	 Facilitating evidence-based health decision-making among professionals, patients and policymakers will be just one of the issues discussed today by EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel and Chief Executive Officer of the Cochrane Collaboration Mark Wilson. Mr Wilson is visiting the agency in the context of the organisations’ on-going collaboration in the area of best practice. The Cochrane Collaboration is an NGO committed to putting evidence at the heart of health decision-making all over the world and its methodology is recognised by international and European organisations as a sound basis for practice. The EMCDDA’s own Best Practice Portal — which presents current evidence in the areas of prevention, treatment, harm reduction and social reintegration — is reinforced by the results of the Cochrane Group on Drugs and Alcohol. Continued collaboration between the two organisations on this project will further support practice. As stated in the EMCDDA Health and social responses to drug problems: a European guide: ‘Regardless of the evidence that exists to support the use of any response option, it is unlikely to be effective if it is implemented poorly’ (1). The meeting will explore ways in which the EMCDDA and the Cochrane Collaboration may strengthen their efforts to promote evidence-based recommendations and support successful implementation strategies. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/promoting-evidence-based-health-decision-making_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0190	2018-03-16	UNK	Call for abstracts for 2018 EUSPR conference 	 A call for abstracts is now open for the 9th annual conference of the European Society for Prevention Research (EUSPR). The event, co-organised by the EUSPR and the EMCDDA, and hosted by the agency in Lisbon, will take place from 24–26 October and focus on the theme of ‘Prevention technologies — improving the use of evidence in prevention practice’. In many areas of public health, and particularly in the field of prevention, there is frequently a gap between research evidence and the services delivered in daily practice. This may mean that public resources are wasted or that target groups and communities are unable to receive the interventions or other support that might benefit them most. At the conference, participants will address some of these challenges and discuss ways forward. Keynote speakers will explore some of the major issues in implementation and translational science as well as highlight strategies that have been successful in bringing together prevention research, practice and policymaking (1). Looking at the use of new technologies in this process, speakers will address how these might offer fresh opportunities for delivering evidence-based interventions and programmes and provide a platform for better engagement across different sectors. The conference will map the obstacles that hinder the uptake and roll-out of effective interventions and local policies in preventing unhealthy behaviours. It will also increase dialogue between practitioners and researchers on how best to overcome them. In order to boost this dialogue, one of the pre-conference events will be a practitioners’ forum sponsored by, and held at, the Lisbon City Hall. Here local decision-makers will be invited to express their views and needs and assess how the available evidence should be presented in order to facilitate its use by them. Reviews of evidence translation strategies have concluded that, whilst passive approaches (e.g. simply publishing research evidence) are useful in raising awareness of effective prevention actions, these are ineffective in changing practice and are unlikely to result in improvements in outcomes for target groups. Questions addressed at the conference — and encouraged in the call for abstracts — will include: How far is research evidence used in the ‘real world’ of prevention? What kind of evidence is ‘useful’ evidence? What are examples of cross-disciplinary working between researchers and prevention professionals? How might new (and old) technologies be used or optimised to better deliver preventive activities and to better engage target groups? The EUSPR promotes the development of prevention science, and its application to practice, so as to promote human health and well-being through high quality research, evidence-based interventions, policies and practices. It supports the EMCDDA in expanding Xchange, the agency’s registry of evidence-based prevention programmes. Around 180 participants are expected at the conference from across Europe and the globe. The closing date for abstracts will be 4 June 2018. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/call-for-abstracts-european-society-for-prevention_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0191	2018-03-08	UNK	Council adopts conclusions on alternatives to coercive sanctions for drug using offenders	 The Justice and Home Affairs Council has adopted today Council conclusions on alternatives to coercive sanctions for drug using offenders. This agreement represents the political will of the 28 EU Member States to apply, in each legal system, alternative measures to coercive sanctions in order to: prevent crime; reduce recidivism; enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system and look at reducing health-related harms and minimising social risks. Alternative measures can include: education; suspension of investigation or prosecution; suspension of sentence with treatment; rehabilitation and recovery, aftercare and social reintegration. This initiative, started under the Maltese Presidency in 2017, was promoted by the Estonian Presidency and concluded under the current Bulgarian Presidency of the Council. It responds to Action 22 of the EU Action Plan on Drugs 2017–2020 which requests Member States and working parties of the Council to provide and apply alternatives to coercive sanctions for drug using offenders (where appropriate, and in accordance with their legal frameworks). The Action Plan also requests concerned parties to increase monitoring, implementation and evaluation of alternatives to coercive sanctions. This political agreement calls on the EU Member States to: implement effectively alternative measures and monitor and evaluate their implementation; develop and share best practice in the field; and raise awareness (e.g. through training among national policy makers, law enforcement, criminal justice, public health, social and education professionals and persons providing support to drug-using offenders). The text: ‘Invites the EMCDDA to continue to monitor the measures and to exchange information and best practices on implementation, development of these measures, their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness’. It also: ‘Invites the European Commission to support this work’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/council-adopts-conclusions-on-alternatives-to-coercive-sanctions-for-drug-using-offenders_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0192	2018-03-08	UNK	International Women's Day – Joint declaration on harassment	 Together, we the Heads of EU agencies and Joint undertakings commit to zero tolerance towards sexual harassment and we cannot and will not accept harassment of any form in our agencies. We take it upon ourselves to communicate to our staff that harassment in the workplace is never acceptable. We have committed ourselves in accordance with existing laws and particularly the staff regulation, to promote diversity at work and provide our staff with a trusted place in which to work. Equality is one of the fundamental values on which the European Union is built. Gender-based violence, including sexual harassment, is one of the most extreme manifestations of inequality and discrimination. Sexual violence and harassment contradict the principle of gender equality and equal treatment. They constitute gender-based discrimination in employment. Cases of sexual harassment and bullying, while significantly underreported, are a matter of health, safety and well-being in the workplace and need to be responded to effectively and in accordance with existing laws.

EMCDDA_UNK_0193	2018-03-07	UNK	Latest data reveal drug-taking habits in close to 60 European cities 	" The latest findings from the largest European project in the emerging science of wastewater analysis are presented today by the Europe-wide SCORE group, in association with the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA)(1). The project analysed wastewater in 56 European cities in 19 European countries in March 2017 to explore the drug-taking behaviours of their inhabitants. From Berlin to Vilnius and from Helsinki to Barcelona, the study analysed daily wastewater samples in the catchment areas of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) over a one-week period. Wastewater from approximately 43 million people was analysed for traces of four illicit drugs: amphetamine, cocaine, MDMA (ecstasy) and methamphetamine. Wastewater based epidemiology is a rapidly developing scientific discipline with the potential for monitoring close to real-time, population-level trends in illicit drug use (2). By sampling a known source of wastewater, such as a sewage influent to a wastewater treatment plant, scientists can now estimate the quantity of drugs used in a community by measuring the levels of illicit drugs and their metabolites excreted in urine (see motion graphic for method)(3). The SCORE group has been conducting annual wastewater monitoring campaigns since 2011. Twenty-one cities have participated in five or more of the seven campaigns run so far, which allows for time-trend analysis of drug consumption based on wastewater testing. The 2017 results are released today in ‘Wastewater analysis and drugs — a European multi-city study’, an updated edition in the EMCDDA Perspectives on Drugs (POD) series. The POD includes an innovative interactive map and a chart-based tool allowing the user to look at geographical and temporal patterns and to zoom in on results per city. The findings offer a valuable snapshot of the drug situation in the cities involved, revealing marked regional variations in drug use patterns: Methamphetamine use remains generally low. Traditionally concentrated in the Czech Republic 	and Slovakia, it now appears to be present in Cyprus, the east of Germany and northern Europe 	(e.g. Finland and Norway). Traces of cocaine in wastewater suggest that cocaine use is highest in western and southern European cities, particularly in cities in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK. The analysis points to very low to negligible cocaine use in the majority of eastern European cities. In cities with wastewater data for 2016 and 2017, the latest figures reveal increases in traces of cocaine, confirming the upward trend reported in 2016. Most of the cities observing sharp increases in traces of MDMA in the period 2011–16 reported a stabilising trend in 2017. The loads of amphetamine detected in wastewater varied considerably across the study locations, with the highest levels reported in cities in the north and east of Europe. Amphetamine was found at much lower levels in cities in the south of Europe. When weekly patterns of drug use were examined, cocaine and MDMA (ecstasy) levels rose sharply at weekends in most cities, while amphetamine use appeared to be more evenly distributed throughout the week. In this project, SCORE uses a standard protocol and a common quality-control exercise in all locations, making it possible to directly compare illicit drug loads in Europe over a one-week period over seven consecutive years. The EMCDDA adopts a multi-indicator approach to drug monitoring on the principle that no single measure can provide a full picture of the drug situation. It views wastewater analysis as a valuable additional tool in its epidemiological toolkit and one which can provide timely information on a wide spectrum of substances.

EMCDDA_UNK_0194	2018-02-26	UNK	61st Commission on Narcotic Drugs, 12-18 March 2018, Vienna	 The United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND), the central UN policy-making body on drug-related matters, holds its 61st session in Vienna from 12–18 March 2018. The CND meets every year to discuss the global state of drug control and to adopt resolutions to guide the way forward. An EMCDDA delegation will be attending the event to: provide technical support to the European Commission and EU Member States; participate in a series of side events; and make EMCDDA products available at a publications stand (M-building, first floor). Tuesday 13 March Side event: Drugs and the darknet 1.10–2.00 p.m., conference room M5 Organised by the Government of Bulgaria and the Delegation of the European Union. Darknet markets provide a largely anonymous platform for trading in a range of illicit goods and services. It is estimated that around two thirds of the offers on darknet markets are drug-related. Drug sales on these markets, although modest when compared to the overall retail drug market, are significant and appear to be expanding. The EMCDDA and Europol published the joint report 'Drugs and the darknet: perspectives for enforcement, research and policy darknet' in November 2017. Wednesday 14 March Special event: Treatment and care of people with drug use disorders in contact with the criminal justice system: supporting alternatives to conviction or punishment 1.10–2.40 p.m., conference room MBR-A Organised by the Government of Bulgaria, the African Union Commission, the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control  Commission of the Organization of American States, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Justice and  Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Sections, the Vienna NGO Committee on Drugs, the World Health Organization and the EMCDDA. Based on the options provided by the international drug control legal framework, our EMCDDA Paper 'Alternatives to punishment for drug-using offenders' considers the rehabilitative measures of treating, educating or reintegrating drug users as alternatives or additions to conviction or punishment that are established in the laws of many countries in Europe today. Side event: The future of drug prevention — how to personalise your strategy to be more effective 2.20–3.10 p.m., conference room M7 Organised by the Government of the Netherlands and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Section, and the EMCDDA. Drug prevention approaches range from those that target society as a whole to interventions focusing on at-risk individuals. The main challenges are in matching these different strategies to target groups and contexts and ensuring that they are evidence-based and have sufficient population coverage. The  EMCDDA Prevention topics page provides an overview of the resources available. Friday 16 March Side event: Management of opioid overdose in the street by non-medical staff2.20–3.10 p.m., conference room M6 Organised by the Government of Italy and the Red Cross and Red Crescent Partnership on Substance Abuse. In 2015, over 8 000 drug-induced deaths were reported in Europe. Opioids, mainly heroin or its metabolites, are present in most overdose cases. With appropriate intervention many opioid overdose deaths may be preventable. Naloxone is a life-saving overdose reversal drug that rapidly counteracts the effects of opioids.

EMCDDA_UNK_0195	2018-02-26	UNK	EMCDDA Director visits Federal Office of Public Health, Switzerland	 EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel is in Switzerland today for a two-day meeting with representatives of the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), the body responsible for evaluating and coordinating the Swiss federal policy on illicit drugs. The visit follows the signature of a working agreement between the EMCDDA and the FOPH on 12 September 2017 and will see the signing of a joint work programme for 2018–20 between the two organisations. The visit offers the EMCDDA the opportunity to discuss technical matters (e.g. monitoring systems, data collection and the Swiss approach to prevention and treatment), with a view to increasing cooperation between the agency and the Swiss authorities. The EMCDDA delegation will also be meeting representatives of Addiction Suisse, an independent foundation working in the field of drug use and other addictive behaviours. This is expected to cover a wide variety of topics including: cannabis regulation; drug markets and wastewater analysis. A visit to a supervised drug consumption room (DCR) in Bern is also on the agenda. DCRs are closely linked to the agency’s public health role in reducing the harms related to drug use (particularly overdose deaths and injecting risk behaviour). The EMCDDA delegation will observe the working of the facility and review issues such as public acceptance of DCRs, levels of use and day-to-day problems encountered. Through its Strategy 2025 and Programming document 2018–20, the EMCDDA is committed to contributing to a healthier and more secure Europe. Developing a closer working relationship with Switzerland will enable the EMCDDA to deepen its understanding of the drug phenomenon and its consequences throughout Europe. The Director will be accompanied by the EMCDDA Heads of unit for Public Health and for Risks to public safety and security. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/emcdda-visits-federal-office-public-health-switzerland_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0196	2018-02-22	UNK	EMCDDA continues support for EU drug-related regional programme in Central Asia	 The European drugs problem is increasingly linked to, and influenced by, global developments. The importance of identifying trends occurring in EU neighbouring countries and worldwide that could impact on the European drug situation is therefore underlined in the EMCDDA Strategy 2025. Among the agency’s work in the area of international cooperation is support for EU drug-related regional programmes. These include the Central Asian Drug Action Programme (CADAP), which is currently in its sixth phase (1). CADAP 6 reflects the EU’s long-term engagement with Central Asian partners to help further strengthen their national policies in drug demand reduction. Delegates at the Third regional project steering committee meeting on CADAP 6, Tashkent, Uzbekistan, 16 February 2018 Five Central Asian countries participate in CADAP: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The overall objective of the programme is the gradual adoption by the five countries of EU and international good practice on drug policy in order to contribute to the reduction of drug problems. The beneficiaries include: policymakers, drug experts, penitentiary and hospital staff, media professionals, teachers, drug users, prisoners, young people and the general public. This month, the EMCDDA participated as partner in CADAP’s Third regional project steering committee meeting held in Tashkent, Uzbekistan (16 February). Presentations included an overview of CADAP activities in 2017 as well as plans for 2018. Highlights in 2017 included: a report on the state of play of drug policymaking in Central Asia; reports on the national drug situations in the CADAP countries; and a national school survey in Kyrgyzstan. All programme activities under CADAP 6 focus on national and regional capacity building, providing policy advice and technical assistance as well as monitoring of the drug situation, prevention, drug treatment and harm reduction services. With CADAP 6 coming to a close on 31 March 2018, the meeting allowed for negotiations on a potential 18-month extension of project to September 2019. Topics proposed for the next phase included: alternatives to incarceration; universal access to care; new psychoactive substances (NPS) and institutional support for national focal points. During the meeting, the EMCDDA presented its current activities in the area of international cooperation and outlined possible ad hoc activities and support for CADAP in the future. In 2017, the agency opened up its expert meetings to participants from Central Asian countries. It also invited the Heads of national drug monitoring centres in Central Asia to attend its latest annual extended meeting of the Reitox network, bringing new opportunities for networking and discussing drug monitoring challenges. In October 2017, the agency hosted an expert from Kazakhstan for a one-month study visit, focusing on NPS treatment and the related methodological framework. In December 2017, the EMCDDA and the Portuguese Reitox focal point (SICAD)  welcomed a delegation of 15 representatives from Central Asia for a week of presentations on the work of the two organisations. The EMCDDA Strategy 2025 and the EMCDDA International Cooperation Framework 2018–25 — adopted by the Management Board in December 2017 — explicitly identify partnerships and synergies with relevant international organisations and cooperation with third countries as one of the agency’s main business drivers to strengthen the EU drug information system. The EMCDDA’s 2018 work programme stipulates that the agency will continue to support the European Commission, as requested, in the implementation of EU drug-related regional programmes, such as CADAP. At the upcoming meeting of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND), being held in Vienna from 12–16 March, a CADAP representative will provide input for a side-event on drug policy, chaired by the Government of Kyrgyzstan. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/emcdda-continues-support-eu-drug-related-regional-programme-central-asia_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0197	2018-02-21	UNK	EMCDDA releases report on European environmental prevention measures to limit unhealthy and risky substance use behaviours	 There is a growing recognition of the important role environmental factors play in health-related behaviour. Traditional substance use prevention approaches in Europe have predominantly focused on warning or informing about the risks of use or on skills-based interventions. In contrast, environmental prevention policies aim to limit unhealthy behaviours by changing the environment in ways which influence people’s substance use choices. In a new report published today — Environmental substance use prevention interventions in Europe — the EMCDDA offers a first operational definition of the concept and an initial overview of where and how such interventions are being used in the region. The definition identifies three categories of environmental prevention measures: regulatory, economic and physical. Drawing on the expertise of leading specialists in the field, today’s report contributes to the debate on this emerging issue. Based on the results of a survey of European prevention practitioners in 2016, the publication paints a first picture of the types of environmental prevention interventions being used in the substance use field in Europe and the extent to which such measures are being implemented. Although the survey has limitations, the publication provides a useful starting point for future research and identifies gaps in provision. Many behaviours we perform every day are automatic and are generally reactions to common and familiar stimuli. Therefore, environmental and social cues and automatic processes are important influences on behaviour. There is growing recognition of the potential public health benefits to be obtained from interventions that take advantage of such processes to change behaviour. Environmental prevention policies and interventions build on current interest in these approaches and seek to provide a stimulus that evokes healthier decisions. This can occur through altering the design of the environment, or aspects of it, to influence choice (‘choice architecture’)(1). For example, physical changes may include bars providing glasses for alcohol that are taller and narrower, but with smaller volumes, tending to make people drink less. Similarly, changes to the economic environment, such as increasing the price of tobacco, may discourage smokers. Regulatory changes can include legislation to constrain undesirable behaviours, such as cannabis use in public places, under-age drinking or drinking and driving. The web-based questionnaire at the heart of the publication generated responses from 117 subjects (from 27 countries) with knowledge of substance use environmental prevention measures. It contained questions on measures covering illicit drugs, alcohol and tobacco and enquired whether measures were available nationally or locally. Of the 49 measures presented to the professionals answering the survey, 39 concerned regulatory and economic environmental prevention measures and 10 referred to physical environmental measures. Regulatory and economic measures were identified as available more often than the physical environmental measures. National-level availability of a variety of regulatory measures related to illicit drugs was reported on average by 83% of respondents. For regulatory or economic measures relating to alcohol and tobacco, an average of 52% and 60% of respondents respectively indicated national-level availability. Physical environmental prevention measures were less commonly reported at the national level: for drugs, alcohol and tobacco combined they were only reported by 19% of respondents. However, local availability of these physical measures was higher, reported, on average, by 56% of respondents. While environmental prevention approaches are currently less well-known than traditional forms of prevention, this may change. Globalisation and rapid technological change may increase substance use opportunities and pressures and environments may become riskier. In these circumstances, environmental interventions are likely to be needed, in addition to skills-based interventions, in order to sustain protective behaviour. Such interventions impact behaviour differently and create complementary ways of achieving positive socialisation. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/environmental-prevention-report_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0198	2018-02-19	UNK	EMCDDA makes first presentation before European Parliament public health committee 	 Today, EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel is in Brussels for an exchange of views with the European Parliament’s Committee for Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI). This, the first EMCDDA presentation before the committee, represents an important opportunity for the agency to inform ENVI members about ongoing drug-related challenges for the European Union in the area of public health. The Director met ENVI Chair Adina-Ioana Valean in October 2017 to raise awareness of the public health implications of: increased rates of drug-related deaths in Europe; the public health threat posed by potent synthetic opioids; the impact of hepatitis C infection on public health across Europe; and the rise of internet drug markets. Additional topics highlighted included: challenges posed by new drugs; use of synthetic cannabinoids by homeless and prison populations; recent increases in drug purity; and the potential benefits of new treatments for hepatitis C. Through its Strategy 2025 and Programming document 2018–20, the EMCDDA is committed to contributing to a healthier and more secure Europe. Closer links with the ENVI Committee will allow the agency — with its capacity to collect and analyse objective data on public health phenomena across Europe — to contribute to the development of European public health policy.   The ENVI Committee meeting will be web streamed: 19 February 2018 -- 16.00 to 16.45 (Brussels time) 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/presentation-envi-committee_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0199	2018-01-26	UNK	New EMCDDA programme 2018–20: contributing to a healthier and more secure Europe 	 This month, the EMCDDA has embarked on work under the EMCDDA Programming Document 2018–20, adopted by the agency’s Management Board on 14 December 2017. This document, which includes the annual work programme for 2018, falls at the crossroads between two strategies — the EMCDDA Strategy 2016–18 and the new EMCDDA Strategy 2025. Built on the structure of the former, it reflects the vision, values, guiding principles and long-term direction of travel of the latter. At the heart of the new document is the EMCDDA’s vision ‘to contribute to a healthier and more secure Europe’, via efforts to improve the health and security of people living in the EU. This overarching commitment will drive the agency in the coming years and guide it in delivering added value to its stakeholders. Among the highlights foreseen for the period 2018–20 will be: the review and improvement of the existing drug monitoring tools (complemented by the increased use of innovative approaches to identify, track and monitor new trends); ongoing implementation of a new regulation on new psychoactive substances (NPS); improvements to the format and content of the annual European Drug Report; and the release of the next editions of the EMCDDA–Europol EU Drug Markets Report (2019) and the Health and social responses to drug use: a European guide (2020). The EMCDDA will also scale up its support for the European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs (ESPAD), ahead of the 2019 data-collection round. This three-year period will also see the implementation of a new Reitox Development Framework and a new EMCDDA International Cooperation Framework. Better understanding of the global dimension of the drug phenomenon is vital for tackling threats to the EU. In this area, work with EU priority third countries will be enhanced through the implementation of European Commission-funded technical assistance projects for candidate and potential candidate countries (IPA 6 and IPA 7 projects) and for neighbouring countries respectively (EU4 Monitoring Drugs project). In 2018, the European Commission will undertake the fourth external evaluation of the EMCDDA, providing the agency with the information needed to further improve performance and successfully implement Strategy 2025. Finally, the agency will carry out a mid-term assessment of Strategy 2025, the findings of which will inform the new Roadmap (to 2025) and reshape, as needed, its work during the second half of this new programming period. The EMCDDA budget for 2018 totals around EUR 16.1 million (EUR 15.4 million EU subsidy, plus a contribution of some EUR 413 000 from Norway and EUR 276 500 from Turkey).   The EMCDDA Programming Document 2018–20 will be published in February. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/programming-document-2018-20_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0200	2018-01-26	UNK	Pilot online survey reaches 50 000 participant milestone 	 As of mid-January, more than 50 000 people had already participated in the European Web Survey on Drugs, a pilot project designed to improve understanding of patterns of drug use at European level. The survey, run with a number of Reitox national focal points, collects information from different groups of drug users, on topics currently not covered by routine data collection. The project, which started with a first wave of six countries in 2016, entered its second phase in late 2017 with an additional nine countries running the survey. The web-based survey targets people aged over 18 who have used one or more drugs over the last 12 months. The survey is structured in modules on: cannabis (resin and herb); powder cocaine; ecstasy (MDMA); amphetamine; methamphetamine and new psychoactive substances. Participants are asked to provide information on the: frequency of their drug use; route of administration; source (bought or shared); amounts used and drug prices. The project builds on the experience of an online survey conducted by the Trimbos Institute in 2012 for the report Further insights into the EU drug markets and aims to complement existing data collected routinely through the Reitox network. While web surveys are not representative of the general population, when carefully conducted they can offer valuable information about drug-use patterns. Routine data-collection tools, such as General Population Surveys (GPS), generally do not have sufficiently large samples of people who use drugs. Furthermore, other research on amounts used tend to be small-scale studies focusing on a specific group of heavy users. The combination of results from web surveys, routine GPS data-collection and emerging methods (e.g. wastewater-based drug epidemiology), has the potential to paint a more comprehensive and realistic picture of drug use and drug markets in Europe. The promotion of the surveys was carried out at national level by each of the focal points involved, with the support of other national partners. Recruitment strategies included the use of networks of low-threshold service providers. A special focus was given to the dissemination of the survey using (audio)visual material and targeted social media advertisements. Operating with high standards of data protection and confidentiality, the web survey is proving to be an inexpensive way of gathering timely data first hand. The results of the first two phases will be used to enhance the drug market size estimates, to be published in the third EU Drug Markets Report in 2019. Given the promising performance of the current survey, it is envisaged that the range of topics covered by this data-collection method could be developed further in the future and that more countries could come on board. A summary of preliminary findings of the first wave of six countries has been made available today.

EMCDDA_UNK_0201	2018-01-25	UNK	EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies’ network: Directors present highlights and priorities 	 Director of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) Virginija Langbakk and EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel are at the European Parliament today where they will present to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) highlights and priorities of the outgoing and incoming presidencies of the EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies’ network (‘JHA’ agencies’ network). EIGE took over the chair of the network from the EMCDDA on 1 January 2018. The network of nine JHA agencies was established in 2006 to boost cooperation in the migration and security fields. Together these agencies play key advisory, operational and coordination roles in implementing EU priorities in the areas of freedom, security and justice and collaborate on a wide range of issues (e.g. human trafficking, migration and border management, drug trafficking and combating organised crime). In 2017, technical support provided by the JHA agencies for the implementation of the European Agenda on Migration and to the European Agenda on Security remained at the centre of the network’s activities. Several technical meetings took place during the year bringing together the expertise of the nine agencies and identifying priority areas of work in analytical and operational fields, training, external relations and ICT. Special emphasis was placed on studying the links between security and health. The network chose the increased role of the internet and the use of cyberspace for criminal purposes as its overarching theme in 2017. In this context, a conference was organised in April 2017 on ‘The internet for criminal purposes — challenges and opportunities for the work of the JHA agencies’ to look at the implications for the JHA agencies and explore future issues, such as monitoring darknets. 2018 will ensure continuity of the joint effort of the JHA agencies and their key stakeholders in improving the management of the EU’s external borders, fighting organised crime and counteracting terrorism and cybercrime. Among the priority topics, proposed by new chair EIGE, is the impact of digitalisation on women and men in the policy areas covered by the network. Also proposed is the analysis of gender equality through the collection and usage of sex disaggregated data and gender statistics for relevant operational areas of the JHA agencies. The network’s achievements in 2017 were presented to the Council’s Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security (COSI) on 14 December 2017. EIGE will chair the JHA agencies’ network until 31 December in 2018, handing over to Europol in 2019.

EMCDDA_UNK_0202	2018-01-24	UNK	EMCDDA chairs EU Agencies’ Network on Scientific Advice (EU-ANSA) in 2018	 This month, the EMCDDA has assumed the chairmanship of the EU Agencies’ Network on Scientific Advice (EU-ANSA), one of the sub-networks operating under the tutelage of the Heads of EU agencies network. Its specific purpose is to allow dialogue between senior scientific staff from agencies with a strong science component to their work and to provide scientific and technical advice to EU institutions, Member States and other relevant EU policymakers. Set up in 2013, the network represents a rich pool of expertise on scientific matters, bringing together 13 EU agencies, two observer members, plus a range of additional bodies, for the exchange of good practice, mutual advice and information-sharing for evidence-based decision-making (1). The network seeks synergies between members’ work and explores ways to enhance the quality of the scientific advice provided. In addition to sharing experiences on best practice, it also constitutes a useful forum for addressing topics that are relevant for agencies working in the scientific area. The focus of activities in 2018 will be on consolidating and completing ongoing activities, in areas such as communicating scientific uncertainty, and continuing work on ‘research clusters’. These clusters, addressing topical themes, assess the research and development needs common to several EU-ANSA agencies in that area and, in doing so, may provide useful input for consideration of future research needs in these domains. A number of new initiatives will also be launched in 2018. These will include a stocktaking of EU-ANSA agencies’ approaches to ‘open access’ publications (particularly academic papers) and a mapping of terminology in the area of ‘futures’ (e.g. foresight, forecasting, early warning, horizon scanning, threat assessment). Futures will also be a special theme for the second EU-ANSA meeting, scheduled to take place in Brussels in November. In the course of 2018, the network will publish ‘EU-ANSA Agencies’ engagement in the EU research knowledge cycle: an overview’. This paper, to be presented to the Heads of EU agencies in February, will highlight the potential added value of the EU-ANSA agencies in identifying knowledge gaps and common research and development needs. EU-ANSA hopes that its individual agencies will use this paper to facilitate communication with institutional stakeholders on how the work of the agencies can provide additional value to EU research activities. Taking over from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on 1 January 2018, the EMCDDA will act as chair until 31 December, before handing over to the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) in 2019. The chairing of the network rotates between the member agencies and each agency is represented in the network by its Chief Scientist, or the equivalent member of staff responsible for the scientific output. Two EU-ANSA meetings will be held this year in May and November. The establishment of EU-ANSA demonstrates a clear commitment by the Heads of EU agencies to act on the recommendations of the EU Inter-institutional Working Group (IIWG) on agencies, which called for improvements in the exchange of information and coordination between agencies providing scientific advice (2).   EU-ANSA meetings 2018 29–30 May 2018: 11th EU-ANSA meeting, hosted by the EC Joint Research Centre (JRC), Ispra. 27–28 November 2018: 12th EU-ANSA meeting, hosted by the Scientific Advice Mechanism (SAM) Unit, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation (DG-RTD), Brussels (to be confirmed). Event on futures (to be confirmed). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/emcdda-chairs-eu-agencies-network-scientific-advice_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0203	2018-01-23	UNK	EMCDDA–ECDC cooperation: building a healthier Europe	 EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel is paying an official visit to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Stockholm today where he will spend two days discussing opportunities for further collaboration between the two agencies with ECDC Director Andrea Ammon. Since signing a formal EMCDDA–ECDC cooperation agreement in 2007, the two agencies have worked together on collecting, analysing and disseminating data, particularly in the area of monitoring drug-related infectious diseases (e.g. HIV, HCV and HBV). In 2011, the agencies issued joint guidance on the Prevention and control of infectious diseases among people who inject drugs. During this week’s meeting, agency representatives will discuss: proposals to promote greater involvement of drug services in infectious disease testing (to complement European Testing Week); ways of improving the surveillance and monitoring capacity of EU Member States (with a particular focus on HCV); and the provision of evidence-based information and best practice for EU Member States and EU institutions. A key feature of the EMCDDA Strategy 2025 is to build the agency’s capacity for targeted health responses to outbreaks of drug-related infectious diseases and other adverse health events. The exchange of knowledge and sharing of best practice between agencies is a part of this process. Working in partnership with ECDC is an important component of the EMCDDA work programme for 2018. Among the initiatives planned are a series of joint threat-assessment missions and the release of guidance on the prevention of communicable diseases in prison settings. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/emcdda-ecdc-cooperation-infectious-disease-testing_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0204	2018-01-22	UNK	Vermont state to legalise recreational cannabis	 On 22 January 2018, Vermont became the ninth US state to legalise possession of cannabis for recreational purposes, when Governor Phil Scott (Republican) signed House Bill 511 (Text of Act as passed by House and Senate). The law will take effect on 1 July 2018. Vermont is the first state to legalise by an initiative of the elected legislature, rather than one drafted and voted by the public, as Vermont’s laws do not permit such ballot initiatives. The legislation, however, only permits home growing and personal possession. Commercial production, distribution and sale are not allowed. Washington, D.C. has a similar law.  The new law permits personal possession of up to 1 ounce (28.5 g) of herbal cannabis or 5 g of cannabis resin, and two mature cannabis plants and four immature plants per household. Minor breaches and public consumption are civil offences, but chemical extraction (e.g. by butane) and supply to minors are crimes. A new advisory commission will examine possible commercial models, road safety and education and prevention strategies, and report to the Governor by 15 December 2018. The main rationale for legalisation is to combat disparities in enforcement of drug laws towards ethnic minorities. According to SAMHSA surveys 2014–2015, 20.8 % of Vermont adults (age 12+) had used cannabis in the last year; the fourth highest rate in the United States, behind Washington DC (23.9 %), Colorado (23.6 %) and Alaska (22.3 %). The highest comparable rate in the European Union (age 15–64) is 11 %, in France. New federal direction The Vermont law was signed despite the 4 January announcement by the US Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, repealing ‘previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana enforcement’ (1). The new announcement reiterates that Congress has determined that ‘marijuana is a dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime’. It then reminds prosecutors how to exercise discretion in using their finite resources, ‘to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.’ While this is a symbolic political statement, it remains to be seen how it will be implemented.

EMCDDA_UNK_0205	2017-12-07	UNK	Registration now open for seventh European drugs summer school	 The University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL) and the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) will be joining forces once again next summer to hold the seventh European drugs summer school (EDSS) on ‘Illicit drugs in Europe: demand, supply and public policies’ (1). Registration is now open for the two-week course, which will take place in the Portuguese capital from 25 June to 6 July (2). The initiative is also supported by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Through a multidisciplinary and interactive approach to the drugs problem, EMCDDA scientific experts, leading academics, guest speakers, policymakers and professionals having participated in previous rounds of the EDSS, will prepare participants to meet the complex policy challenges in this field — both in Europe and beyond. The focus of the 2018 course will be on drug prevention approaches. Week 1 of the summer school, focusing on the ‘Drugs problem: market, substances, use and harms’, will feature lectures on: the global burden of drug-related problems; drug markets in Europe; detecting new drugs; and prevention approaches in demand-reduction interventions. This session will also focus on the EMCDDA’s epidemiological indicators and their use in informing drug policy. Week 2, dedicated to ‘Policymaking for drug-related issues’, will include lectures on: drug policies and new challenges (concepts, issues and analysis); the EU drug strategy; drug laws and public expenditure; and monitoring supply reduction and drug enforcement activity. It will close with an analysis of the link between evidence and decision-making, including examples of implementation. Study visits to outreach facilities and to one of the Portuguese commissions for dissuasion will be organised over the two weeks. During the course, students will also participate in interactive workshops to discuss their own projects and views. The course will conclude with an open debate with guest speakers. The target audiences for the EDSS are: university students, researchers, professionals and administrators interested in working on drug issues. The previous rounds of the summer school brought together students from the EU Member States as well as from Africa, Asia, Australia and the Americas. Profiles of former alumni and their testimonials can be found on the official summer school website and their statements viewed in a promotional video. In 2018, students will again be able to apply for scholarships and ‘early-bird’ reductions are also available (3). The EDSS will be run in English. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/fs12/registration-open-summer-school_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0206	2017-11-28	UNK	Drugs and the darknet: a growing threat to health and security	 Illicit trade on darknet markets is one sign of the increasingly complex nature of transnational organised crime in the European Union. In a new report out today — Drugs and the darknet: perspectives for enforcement, research and policy — the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and Europol present the latest understanding of how darknet markets function, the threats they pose to health and security and how Europe can respond. The new report is being launched in Lisbon today by: Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship; Europol Executive Director Rob Wainwright and EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel. Darknet markets — also known as cryptomarkets — provide a largely anonymous platform for trading in a range of illicit goods and services. It is estimated that around two thirds of the offers on darknet markets are drug-related. Drug sales on these markets, although modest when compared to the overall retail drug market, are significant and appear to be expanding. EU-based suppliers are important players in the darknet ecosystem, accounting for some 46% (around EUR 80 million) of all drug sales globally, on the 16 major darknet markets analysed in the period 2011–15. A number of potential threats posed by the darknet are identified in the report, including the development of decentralised networks — allowing marketplaces to exist on multiple servers — and new parcel delivery and collection systems. On this occasion, Dimitris Avramopoulos said: ‘Over the last decade, illegal online markets have changed how drugs are bought and sold. Criminal activity on the darknet has become more innovative and more difficult to predict. We shouldn’t be playing catch-up with criminals: we should be one step ahead of them. That is why we are boosting our efforts to fight illegal drugs and step up cybersecurity. Cyberspace has no borders and we should all work together, the Commission, Member States the EMCDDA, Europol and our international partners. Our aim is to stop huge profits from drugs ending up in the pockets of organised crime groups in Europe and beyond, but most importantly to protect the health of our citizens and in particular of young people.' Rob Wainwright added: ‘Addressing cybercrime and the use of information technology platforms for criminal purposes has become an important policing priority across the EU. The recent takedown in July 2017 of Alphabay and Hansa, two of the largest darknet markets, is an example of how law enforcement can intervene to disrupt this environment. Despite this positive achievement, those involved in the online drug trade appear to be resilient to such disruption and able to re-organise rapidly. European-level cooperation and intelligence sharing, along with the targeting of high-impact vendors, will be critical in countering this threat’. According to the report, market disruption should form part of a broader, more integrated set of measures implemented as part of an overall strategy to address drug trade in the darknet ecosystem. Darknet investigation teams, modelled and promoted by Europol, will be at the heart of such an integrated strategy. Engagement with key industries (e.g. information technology, social media, payment and product distribution services) will be increasingly important for identifying and responding to new threats in this area. Alexis Goosdeel noted: ‘In just a few clicks, buyers can purchase almost any type of drug on the darknet whether synthetic drugs, cannabis, cocaine, heroin or a range of new psychoactive substances, including highly potent fentanils. This poses a growing threat to the health and security of citizens and communities across the EU. The new insights provided by this joint analysis make an important contribution to informing and preparing Europe’s response to this threat’. The dynamic nature of online markets, with their ability to evolve to counter threats and exploit new opportunities, means that enhanced monitoring capacity in this area is crucial to ensure that responses keep pace with developments. The analysis presented in the report is forward-looking, as the challenges in this area are constantly evolving. The online trade in illicit goods and services was recognised as one of the engines of organised crime and a key threat to the safety of EU citizens in Europol’s 2017 EU Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment (SOCTA). It is also being tackled as part of the coordinated response to serious and organised crime set out in the EU Policy Cycle for organised and serious international crime (2018–2021). Today’s report covers three areas: key concepts; an EU-focused analysis of drug supply on darknet markets; and law-enforcement perspectives. The analysis provides a policy-orientated review intended to facilitate discussions at EU level on how to respond to the phenomenon. It also presents recommendations in the areas of law enforcement, monitoring and policy.

EMCDDA_UNK_0207	2017-11-28	UNK	Some 50 countries attend 2017 Reitox week in Lisbon 	 Representatives of candidate, potential candidate and neighbouring countries of the European Union and of Central Asia are joining members of the EMCDDA’s Reitox network in Lisbon today for the kick-off of the agency’s sixth Reitox week . The purpose of this annual event is to broaden the scope of regular Reitox meetings, underline the importance of the EU drug monitoring model and add impetus to the agency’s technical cooperation with countries outside the EU (1). Reitox — the European information network on drugs and drug addiction — was set up in 1993 and is composed of 30 national monitoring centres or national focal points (NFPs) in the 28 EU Member States, Turkey and Norway, as well as a focal point at the European Commission. The NFPs — from which the agency draws the bulk of its data — collect and analyse national information on drugs, drawing on various sectors including health, justice and law enforcement. The 2017 Reitox week (28 November–1 December) unites some 50 nations including: the current 30 members of the network and a number of beneficiary countries of the European Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) and the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP)(2). For first time, the meeting will also welcome partner countries of the Central Asia Drug Action Programme (CADAP). The Reitox week encompasses three events: international cooperation project-related meetings; an ‘extended meeting’ of the Reitox network — this year focusing on ‘Migration and drugs: challenges and opportunities for monitoring’ (3) — and the regular Heads of focal point meeting. During the extended Reitox meeting, experts and researchers from nine countries (4) and from the European Border Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) will share information on national situations and perspectives relating to migration and drugs. In particular, they will look at the possible threats and vulnerabilities linked to these phenomena as well as the responses developed at national level. This day of exchange will close with a presentation of the EMCDDA’s Health and social responses to drug problems: a European guide, released on 24 October, and will look at the overall picture of responses addressing the needs of migrants. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/fs11/sixth-annual-reitox-week_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0208	2017-11-23	UNK	Commissioner Avramopoulos and Heads of EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies meet in Lisbon to support EU Agendas on Migration and Security	 Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship will be in Lisbon on 28 November to meet the directors of the nine EU agencies working in the area of Justice and Home Affairs (1). The event — hosted by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) as chair of the JHA agencies’ network this year — will take stock of the agencies’ joint achievements in 2017 and allow for an exchange of views on strategic developments. The EMCDDA will hand over its year-long presidency at the end of December to the Vilnius‑based European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) to steer the network in 2018. The JHA agencies’ network was established in 2006 to boost cooperation in the migration and security fields. The nine agencies play key advisory, operational and coordination roles in implementing EU priorities in the areas of freedom, security and justice. The network plays an important part in improving the management of the EU’s external borders, developing effective asylum and return procedures, fighting organised crime and counteracting terrorism and cybercrime. The technical support of the JHA agencies is crucial for the implementation of the European Agenda on Migration and the European Agenda on Security. During the meeting, the participants will discuss opportunities for enhanced inter-agency cooperation to support the EU institutions and Member States in responding to Europe’s challenges in the dynamic, and constantly evolving fields, of migration and security. The directors will also focus on issues related to the use of cyberspace for criminal purposes, the overarching theme of the network’s activities this year. In the course of 2017, the network held several meetings identifying priority areas of work in analytical and operational fields, training, external relations and ICT. A conference was also organised in April on ‘The internet for criminal purposes — challenges and opportunities for the work of the JHA agencies’, to look at how cyberspace has influenced criminal activities and explore future issues such as monitoring darknets. The network’s achievements in 2017 will be presented later in the year to the Council’s Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security (COSI) and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) of the European Parliament.

EMCDDA_UNK_0209	2017-11-23	UNK	ECDC–EMCDDA review: Can active case finding help reduce communicable diseases in prisons?	 Compared with the general public, people in prison have a higher prevalence of infection with HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and tuberculosis. Such increased prevalence of diseases among people in prisons is recognised as a major risk for the health of both people living and working in prison settings and for the general population, as the vast majority of people in prisons return to their communities after less than 24 months of incarceration. According to the principle of equivalence of care, people in prison should enjoy an equivalent standard of care as in the community. Yet, their health needs tend to be greater. Incarceration may thus represent a unique opportunity to make adequate healthcare services available to people and target groups that usually are hard to reach. Active case finding to promote early diagnosis is a key measure to prevent onward transmission of communicable diseases and allow entry into care to individuals in need. As its broader implementation may be particularly relevant for prison settings, the available evidence was assessed in a systematic literature review, performed by ECDC and the EMCDDA. Despite some limitations, the findings provide a valid argument to strengthen case finding initiatives in prison settings. They also show that, in such settings, the way testing is organised and offered to people in detention, influences the uptake of tests for communicable diseases. For example, the available evidence suggests that the active offer of tests by health care provider yields a higher uptake compared with people in prison having to ask for test themselves. However, due to lack of research, current evidence does not provide a clear indication on the most effective timing and optimal testing modalities for these diseases in prison settings. This systematic review highlights important knowledge gaps. More operational research is needed to assess the effectiveness of interventions to increase the offer and uptake of testing in prison settings. The findings from this systematic review will serve as the evidence base for the development of ECDC and EMCDDA public health guidance on active case finding for communicable diseases in prison settings to be release in 2018. This guidance will be part of a broader set of guidance documents on prevention and control of communicable diseases in prison settings, which will encompass other specific interventions such as vaccination, and specific disease prevention and control methods. In this context, ECDC and the EMCDDA welcome the efforts of European HIV-Hepatitis Testing Week to increase positive dialogue among those who might benefit from being tested and those who offer tests across Europe. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/joint-publication-communicable-diseases-prison_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0210	2017-11-21	UNK	Maine governor vetoes retail law, citing Federal policy	 In November 2016, the US state of Maine voted to legalise the cultivation, production, sale, taxation and use of cannabis. Personal use is now permitted, but a bill to implement the regulations for trade was vetoed on 3 November 2017 by the State Governor, Paul LePage. Three months after the vote for legalisation, the state government passed a law (LD 88) to permit personal cultivation and use. The same law delayed legalisation of commercial production, retail sales and taxation until February 2018, to allow legislators to finalise administrative rules such as licensing. Those administrative rules were drafted by the 17-member Joint Select Committee on Marijuana Implementation, in a bill (LD 1650) that was passed by both state Houses on 23 October 2017. This bill has now been vetoed. In his veto letter, the State Governor cited concerns about: lack of consistency with the state’s existing medical cannabis system, tax revenue possibly not covering the costs of implementation of the regulatory system, and unrealistic deadlines for executive action that may result in hastily crafted legislation. Most fundamentally though, he was concerned that the bill was in direct conflict with US federal law: ‘The Obama administration said they would not enforce Federal law related to marijuana, however the Trump administration has not taken that position. Until I clearly understand how the federal government intends to treat states that seek to legalize marijuana, I cannot in good conscience support any scheme in state law to implement expansion of legal marijuana in Maine. If we are adopting a law that will legalize and establish a new industry and impose a new regulatory infrastructure that requires significant private and public investment, we need assurances that a change in policy or administration at the federal level will not nullify those investments.’ In this situation, the provisions of the law of January 2017 prevail, and purchase from a retail outlet should become legal from 1 February 2018; even if licensing details remain undefined. Legislators may submit a new proposal in January 2018.

EMCDDA_UNK_0211	2017-11-21	UNK	New legislation published today to bring faster response to new drugs	 Europe’s ability to rapidly respond to public health and security threats caused by new psychoactive substances (NPS) will be significantly strengthened, thanks to new legislation published today by the European Union (1). The legislation includes a stronger EU Early Warning System (EWS) and a faster risk-assessment process. The developments are in response to the recent growth in the market in NPS and follow a proposal from the European Commission (EC) comprising: a Regulation regarding information exchange on, and an early-warning system and risk-assessment procedure for, new psychoactive substances (amending the EMCDDA founding regulation); and a Directive including new psychoactive substances in the definition of ‘drug’. The new legislation retains the current three-step approach to responding to NPS — early warning, risk assessment and control measures — while significantly strengthening existing processes by streamlining and accelerating data-collection and assessment procedures. Throughout the new procedure, shorter deadlines are introduced. The EMCDDA will continue to play a leading role in monitoring NPS reported by EU Member States and will initiate an in-depth scientific investigation into any new substance causing concern. Following the submission by the agency of its initial report, the European Commission will have two weeks to request it to assess the potential risks posed by the substance, to be delivered within six weeks. Based on the risk assessment report, the Commission may propose whether or not to control the substance through a formal decision. The Council of the EU and the European Parliament will then have two months to agree or not. National authorities will have six months (instead of 12) to place the substance under control on their territory once the decision enters into force. In 2016, 66 NPS were detected for the first time via the EU Early Warning System (EWS) — a rate of over one per week. The EWS currently monitors over 620 new psychoactive substances compared with around 350 in 2013. This total included 24 new fentanils, highly potent opioids detected on Europe’s drug market in the past few years. Exposure to very small amounts of fentanils can cause life-threatening poisoning, reflected in the substantial increase in the number of reported fatalities involving their use. Over the last year, for example, more than 60 deaths in Europe involved carfentanil. The EMCDDA and Europol — with the support of the EU Member States, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Commission — have been working together since 1997 to monitor the appearance of new drugs and the extent of their diffusion on the European drug scene. The first legislative frameworks (1997 and 2005)(2) have allowed the partners to develop an advanced early-warning system for monitoring new drugs and a structure for performing scientific risk assessments. Commenting today, EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel said: ‘The EMCDDA welcomes this new legislation to strengthen the EU’s response to new psychoactive substances. The unprecedented rise in the availability of new drugs in recent years clearly requires us to strengthen our early-warning and response capacity. This faster legal mechanism will help us keep pace with the NPS phenomenon and ensure that prompt action is taken to protect public health’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/16/new-legislation-response-new-psychoactive-drugs_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0212	2017-11-15	UNK	Furanylfentanyl to be placed under control across the EU	 Today the European Union has decided to subject the new synthetic opioid furanylfentanyl to control measures throughout the EU (1). The implementing decision of the Council of the EU (2), based on an initial proposal by the European Commission, was adopted in the final stage of the three-step legal procedure designed to respond to potentially threatening new psychoactive substances (NPS) available on the market (3)(4). The substance in question has been raising health concerns in Europe after harmful effects related to its use were reported by the Member States through the EU Early Warning System (EWS), which is implemented by the EMCDDA and Europol. Following publication of the decision in the Official Journal of the European Union, Member States will have one year to introduce the controls into national legislation. The decision is based on the findings of a formal risk assessment of the drug, conducted by the extended EMCDDA Scientific Committee on 23 May 2017, with participation of additional experts from the EU Member States, European Commission, Europol and the European Medicines Agency. The risk assessment report assessed the health and social risks of the drug, as well as international trafficking and the involvement of organised crime (5). It concluded that the high potency of the substance constitutes a serious risk of acute toxicity through respiratory depression. Furanylfentanyl is structurally related to fentanyl (a controlled substance widely used in medicine as an adjunct to general anaesthesia during surgery and for pain management). Available in the EU since at least June 2015, furanylfentanyl is sold as a ‘research chemical’ and as a ‘legal’ replacement to illicit opioids. It has no established or acknowledged medical value or use in the EU. Information from seizures shows that some furanylfentanyl on the market in Europe has been produced by chemical companies based in China. Furanylfentanyl has been seized in powder and liquid form, including ready-to-use nasal sprays. It has also been sold as e-liquids for vaping in electronic cigarettes. At the time of the risk assessment (May 2017), it had been detected in 16 EU Member States and Norway, with 23 deaths associated with the substance reported by six EU countries. Clinical experience suggests that naloxone works as an antidote to poisoning caused by the drug. In Europe and in North America, highly potent synthetic opioids are a growing health threat. Twenty-five new synthetic opioids were detected in Europe between 2009 and 2016 (18 of these were fentanils). Of the nine risk assessments carried out by the EMCDDA and its partners in 2017, five were fentanils (acryloylfentanyl, furanylfentanyl, 4F-iBF, carfentanil and THF-F). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/15/council-implementing-decision-control-furanylfentanyl_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0213	2017-11-06	UNK	European Commissioner Julian King visits EMCDDA	 European Commissioner for the Security Union, Julian King pays his first visit to the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) today, as part of a two-day round of meetings in Lisbon, taking in the Portuguese Parliament, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the Web Summit (1). During his visit, Commissioner King will meet EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel and the agency’s experts in the area of security. The European security agenda highlights the need to understand the interactions that exist between drug-related crime and the operation of the drug market as well as other areas of criminality, the activities of organised criminal groups and additional serious security threats. The latest EMCDDA–Europol EU Drug Markets Report, showed that threats in this area are increasing, partly because of the changing business models used by transnational organised crime groups. The EMCDDA’s long-term strategic vision is to contribute to a ‘healthier and more secure Europe’ by providing sound evidence for policies and actions on drugs. The EMCDDA Strategy 2025 states that: ‘Identifying new drug-related security threats and transmitting this information rapidly, so that appropriate responses can be developed, is a key requirement for Europe to keep pace with the growing security challenges emerging in this area’ (2). During the meeting, EMCDDA experts will present to Commissioner King the agency’s contribution to the EU Policy Cycle on Serious Organised International Crime, based on its strategic overview of the EU drug market, including drug production and trafficking and current threat assessment work linked to new synthetic opioids (particularly new fentanils). The meeting will also cover the challenges of darknets, ahead of an EMCDDA–Europol report on the subject to be published later this month (3). A key strategic challenge for the EMCDDA is to continue to develop the information and analytical tools necessary to identify significant new developments and to boost its observational capacity to address innovation. This is particularly important with respect to synthetic drug production and how information technology developments are providing new opportunities for the production, marketing and sale of both established drugs and new psychoactive substances. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/14/visit-commissioner-julian-king_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0214	2017-10-24	UNK	EMCDDA publishes its first European guide on responding to drug problems  	 How to respond to the problems of older heroin users? How to tackle deaths from highly potent fentanils? How to prevent harms from drug and alcohol use in festivals and clubs? These are among the questions explored by a new European guide released today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA)(1). Drawing on insights from 30 countries, Health and social responses to drug problems: a European guide presents the agency’s first overview of actions and interventions currently available to address the consequences of illicit drug use. It is designed to benefit those approaching drug problems from a public health planning perspective as well as frontline workers and practitioners. Drug use today presents us with a complex and ever-shifting set of problems, and a wide diversity of programmes exists to address differing needs and objectives. The new guide provides practical guidance on how responses in the drugs area can be better conceived, targeted and delivered, furnishing the building blocks for developing, and successfully implementing, interventions. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘The EMCDDA is committed to assisting policymakers and practitioners in planning and delivering policies and programmes that contribute to a healthier and more secure Europe. This innovative new guide surveys some of the main public health challenges in the drugs field today and provides a map with which to navigate the various stages of designing, targeting and implementing effective responses. To remain relevant, those involved in responding to drug problems must be prepared to adapt, innovate and develop new partnerships. This practical guide equips them with the tools to respond to the drug problems of today, but also to prepare for those of tomorrow’. The guide views health and social responses to drug problems from the three perspectives of responding to: problems associated with different types of drug and patterns of use; the needs of different groups (e.g. women, young people, migrants, ageing drug users); and problems in different settings (e.g. prisons, nightlife, festivals, schools, workplace, local communities). Designed as an initial reference point, the publication includes summaries and user-friendly signposting to highlight key information, best practice examples and implications for policy and practice. It also acts as a gateway to a wide range of online resources, providing links to evidence and tools. Evidence-based responses gaining ground in Europe ‘Evidence-based responses appear to be steadily gaining ground in Europe, and within the current financial climate, there appears to be greater interest than ever in ensuring that scarce health resources are well spent’, says the guide. It underlines the importance of understanding what evidence exists to support a specific intervention, and how to use it. Here it provides ‘evidence ratings’ for the different actions explored (Spotlight p. 23), but stresses that what works in one group or setting may fail in a different context. A key message emerging from the guide is that using evidence is an ‘ongoing process’ and that it is essential to develop the knowledge base through collaboration in research, monitoring and the sharing of best practice. The guide links to the EMCDDA Best practice portal, which contains a wide range of resources, including the ‘Xchange’ registry of evidence-based programmes, and standards to boost the quality of responses (Spotlight, p. 164)(2). The benefits of reaching out and forming new partnerships Drug problems often interact or co-exist with other health and social problems. The guide therefore underscores the value of drug services forming partnerships with other areas (e.g. sexual and mental health care, housing services) to improve effectiveness and efficiency (Spotlight, p. 31, p. 72). Some groups have a particular need for integrated services, such as ageing opioid users who are vulnerable to health problems, or drug users with mental health issues. ‘Effective cooperation between services is essential to meeting the complex health and social needs of many of those with drug problems’, states the guide. The guide provides examples of a range of collaborative approaches in Europe, including partnerships between prison and community healthcare providers, which facilitate treatment delivery in prison as well as continuity of care upon release. Also, club owners, the police, health and emergency services and municipalities are teaming up with drug services to prevent and reduce the harms associated with drug and alcohol use in nightlife settings (Chapter 4.2)(3). The value of engaging with local communities and drug users to improve the delivery of services is also explored. Examples include collaboration around drug consumption rooms, which can reduce harms to the community and drug user (Spotlight p. 156), and user-led interventions for recovery and reintegration (Spotlight p. 167). Harnessing the potential of new technologies The internet, social networking apps, new payment technologies and encryption software are changing the way in which drugs can be bought and sold. These changes not only affect drug markets and consumption patterns but also offer new opportunities for health and social responses. ‘To remain relevant, those involved in responding to drug problems will need to … harness the potential of new technologies to support the better delivery of prevention, treatment and harm reduction initiatives’, affirms the guide. A spotlight is placed on e-health interventions, which can use digital technologies to provide harm-reduction advice, train treatment professionals and reach out to vulnerable young people who may be reluctant to engage with formal services (Spotlight p. 119). Reducing drug-related harms: opportunities and gaps The guide reviews progress to date in preventing and reducing drug-related harms (e.g. the expansion of opioid substitution treatment) but highlights areas where opportunities exist for further improvement. Hepatitis C infections account for a considerable share of drug-related health costs in Europe)(4). The publication states: ‘Currently, a window of opportunity exists with the emergence of new treatments, and the eradication of this disease now appears a realistic possibility’. Here it highlights the benefits of better coordination between drug and specialist liver services to guarantee adequate treatment coverage and protect those at risk from future reinfection (Spotlight, p. 62). ‘Without effective action, the future costs associated with a hepatitis C infection, in particular, are likely to grow exponentially’, concludes the guide. Figure 2.5 Hepatitis C treatment before and after the advent of direct-acting antiviral agents Risk factors associated with fatal overdoses are now well known and there have been some notable advances in life-saving interventions, such as the provision of the opioid-overdose-reversal drug, naloxone. However, the increasing number of overdose deaths in Europe suggests a need to expand the provision of these, and other, interventions which reduce the risk of opioid-related deaths. Figure 2.3 Interventions to reduce the risk of opioid-related deaths Figure 2.4 Interventions in place in European countries that can reduce opioid-related deaths New policy perspectives and modern drug problems call for flexible responses New policy perspectives and changing drug problems bring fresh challenges for European drug responses. As highlighted, flexibility is needed: ‘…modern drug problems can change quickly and have the potential to overwhelm existing drug policies and response models’. Recent challenges include the rapid emergence of new psychoactive substances, such as highly potent opioids (e.g. fentanils — Spotlight, p. 52) and synthetic cannabinoids (Spotlight, p. 81). As more new substances enter the drugs market, toxicological and forensic capacity must also be improved as part of the frontline response. Against the contemporary backdrop of socio-demographic and economic change, the guide explores the potential vulnerability of migrants and asylum seekers to drug problems and the need for services which recognise diversity and build trust (Table 3.1). Recent changes in the regulatory framework for cannabis occurring in parts of the Americas are also generating interest among policymakers and the public in Europe (Spotlight, p. 40)(5). And there is a growing interest, in both regions, in exploiting the therapeutic potential of cannabis-based medicines. Developments in the cannabis policy area may have knock-on effects for prevention, treatment and harm reduction responses to this drug, and valuable lessons may be learnt from innovations outside Europe. 3.3 Availability of selective prevention interventions for ethnic minority groups in the European Union, 2015/16 The EU Drugs Strategy 2013–20 aims to reduce drug demand, dependence and drug-related health and social harms and to reduce the supply of drugs. This guide supports the strategy in the area of reducing drug demand and the health and social consequences of drug use. Alexis Goosdeel concludes: ‘We believe that the EMCDDA can best contribute to the health and security of European citizens by providing an analysis of the drug problems we face, combined with a critical review of potential responses and of the practical tools to support policy decisions and practice. This guide is our first, and most ambitious, attempt yet to assemble information on available health and social responses to drug use in Europe in one easily accessible resource. By highlighting gaps in knowledge and practice alongside opportunities for improvement and development, it provides the basis for a refreshed programme of work in this field for the years to come’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/13/emcdda-publishes-responses-guide_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0215	2017-10-24	UNK	Sharing experience of evidence-based prevention programmes: EMCDDA launches new Xchange registry	 Today the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) launches Xchange (1), a new online registry of evidence-based prevention programmes. In its first phase, the registry will make available manualised interventions that European evaluation studies show have beneficial outcomes relating to substance use (2). For programmes of US origin, the registry also provides the evidence level of the evaluation studies conducted there (Blueprint ratings). In addition to providing information on the effectiveness of programmes, the registry also offers information on the experiences of professionals who have implemented these programmes in individual European countries. This enables decision-makers to assess the ease with which programmes can be implemented in different social, cultural and organisational contexts. The registry is the centrepiece of a growing network of national registries. Through Xchange, an interested visitor can access additional details on a specific programme in the national language within a local registry (3), or access through a national registry the European implementation experiences of a given programme. What is the scope of the registry and what kind of programmes are included? At present, Xchange contains 20+ manualised prevention programmes, all of which address substance use-related problems. The programme must be still active (i.e. currently in use in at least one EU country) and be judged to be beneficial in Europe by at least one European evaluation study. In future, Xchange will be expanded to include programmes that target other risky behaviours and possibly environmental interventions at local level. Why such a European registry? The Council of the EU’s Minimum quality standards in drug demand reduction in the EU (4) demands that prevention professionals have access to knowledge on effective prevention programmes. A growing number of programmes are considered effective at reducing substance use and related problems under carefully controlled conditions. However, access to evidence‐based prevention programmes is still limited and they remain under‐utilised compared to prevention strategies with no empirical evidence for effectiveness. Xchange aims to address this challenge by providing access to such programmes. An additional challenge is that, even when effective programmes are used, they are not being implemented with quality and fidelity in real-life settings, often because they do not fit into the existing prevention culture and infrastructure. Xchange provides decisional support by continuously compiling information on implementation experiences with the programmes contained within it. Users can access information on the effectiveness of a programme and on the extent to which it can be implemented. The real-life scenario in Europe’s multiple cultures is that a highly effective programme may not be easy to implement in a given country, while a less effective programme may be easier to implement. Users of Xchange will have more tools for balanced decision-making at their fingertips because the registry also allows for selecting programmes according to targeted outcomes or the risk and protective factors it addresses. A unique feature of Xchange is that it allows national high-ranking programmes to be promoted in this European registry and, inversely, allows international visitors to find more details about local adaptations in national languages. If you would like to share your experience of implementing one of the programmes in the registry, you are invited to contribute by filling in the online implementation questionnaire (https://drugusersurvey.limequery.com/index.php/839193/lang-en). What if I don’t agree with the evidence rating of a programme? The registry is dynamic and constantly evolving: if you disagree with an evidence rating or are aware of new good quality studies which review the behavioural outcomes of any of the programmes included in Xchange, please send them to evidence-Xchange@emcdda.europa.eu These will be discussed at the next meeting of the Review Board of the Xchange registry and will be taken into account when rating the evidence of the respective entry. The board currently consists of one member of the EMCDDA Scientific Committee, members of the European Society for Prevention Research, EMCDDA staff members and appointed experts. The list of current members can be found here www.emcdda.europa.eu/best-practice/xchange/about What next? The registry will be expanded to address an increasing range of solution-oriented interventions (e.g. prevention of overdose in the community; prevention of violence and crime and prevention of radicalisation). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/fs10/xchange-registry_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0218	2017-10-18	UNK	How to estimate the cost of drug treatment in Europe? 	 It is estimated that over 1 million people receive treatment for drug-related problems in the European Union every year. With shrinking public budgets, increasing pressure on health systems, changes in the substances used and the need to provide ongoing care to chronic cases, how can we estimate the cost of drug treatment in Europe? This is the question explored in a new report released today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) entitled Drug treatment expenditure: a methodological overview (1). Data collection and research are well established in Europe on treatment activities and their outcomes, yet information is limited on the costs of drug treatment. In a first step towards filling this data gap, the new report offers a unique overview of the economic models currently used to estimate drug treatment expenditure around the world. According to the report, in the last 10 years, more than half of the EU countries have reported comprehensive estimates for drug-related expenditure incurred by general government, which includes spending on drug treatment. These have estimated total drug-related public expenditure at between 0.01% and 0.5 % of GDP, with health expenditure representing between 15% and 53% of total drug-related expenditure (2). However, the EMCDDA advises caution when interpreting these data (e.g. definitions of drug treatment expenditure and the estimation methods may differ). ‘It is still not possible to provide a reliable and complete European picture of public expenditure on drug treatment’, states the report, which focuses on the methodologies behind the estimates rather than on the estimates themselves. A number of factors currently act as barriers to developing this field of analysis: the absence of commonly agreed definitions or methods; a lack of harmonised or complete datasets on drug-related public spending; and a lack of agreement about the most appropriate economic models to use. Developing objective, reliable and comparable means of estimating public expenditure would be an important advancement in the economic evaluation of policies and interventions. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘In this economic climate, more than ever, policymakers and service planners require data and information on the capacity, performance and costs of national treatment systems in order to support investment decisions and to make sound policy choices. I hope that this report will be seen as an important signpost in the development of improved estimates for public expenditure on drug treatment and as a contribution to defining good practice in drug policy evaluation. Ultimately this will lead to a more cost-effective allocation of resources in the future’. The report sheds light on current good practice in this field and suggests areas for future methodological development. Drawing on the experience of economists, policy advisers and scholars from Europe, the United States and Australia, it provides a state-of-the-art overview of estimating drug treatment expenditure as well as data sources, their uses and limitations. The report includes, for example: a step-by-step approach applied in the Australian health system to estimate drug treatment costs; a set of studies showing representative examples of data-collection and estimation methods in Europe; a series of tools to account for costs with different aims, including a calculator developed in the UK to support local authorities in estimating their spending on drug-related specific interventions; an assessment of how costs of drug treatment vary according to the type of payer (public versus private payers), type of treatment (inpatient and outpatient providers) and type of pharmacological treatment adopted (pharmacological versus behavioural therapies) (e.g. in the United States) and; an analysis underlining the need to contextualise results. Spending on drug treatment must be analysed bearing in mind the type of overall healthcare and drug treatment policy, as well as the socio-economic framework. The report concludes by identifying a set of desirable first steps that may be taken to develop estimates of spending on drug treatment (see table page 188). These include clarifying the scope of the treatment definition and stating whether estimates refer to expenditure linked strictly to a person’s drug use treatment or also to the spending on treating associated problems (e.g. infectious diseases). The EU action plan on drugs (2017–20) identifies developments in national evaluations and public expenditure estimates of the EU Member States as an overarching indicator for measuring European achievements in the drug policy field. For its part, the EMCDDA will continue to contribute to improving methods to evaluate drug policy and to estimate public expenditure on drug treatment (3). As stated in the report: ‘The EMCDDA hopes that the evaluation of drug policy and the methods used to estimate public expenditure on drug treatment in Europe will become more scientific, widely accepted and integrated with good practice’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/11/insights-drug-treatment-expenditure_en

The event, taking place on the eve of Lisbon Addictions 2017 (2), is a collaborative initiative of the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA), the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the New Zealand Drug Foundation. The symposium will bring together international experts in the field who have contributed to advances in drug detection technology, innovations in prevention, and drug driving policy. The event will offer participants the opportunity to share lessons learned, showcase new research and identify gaps in knowledge. Recent changes in cannabis policy in various parts of the world will be in special focus at the event, along with their implications for drug‑impaired driving. Guest speakers from the United States (Colorado, Washington State) and Canada will share their experiences in this fast-moving policy area (3). The event will be organised around four panel sessions, exploring: contemporary challenges for regulatory models; advances in drug testing, screening and detection; changes in cannabis policy: implications for impaired driving; and future perspectives for research and monitoring. In some parts of the world, the prevalence of drug‑impaired driving has begun to rival that of alcohol‑impaired driving. This has resulted in a greater focus on the ability to detect drug‑impaired drivers using roadside screening tools. Many countries are working towards laws that establish maximum permissible blood‑drug limits. As in the case with alcohol, these laws would mean that any driver ‘over the limit’ would be committing an offence and there would be no need to prove physical impairment. The outcome of the symposium will be a report for policymakers answering some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on this issue. A session at the Lisbon Addictions 2017 conference will also be dedicated to drugs and driving, delivering feedback from the international symposium (4). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/9/symposium-drug-impaired-driving_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0220	2017-10-18	UNK	Leading experts to review latest developments in detecting illicit drugs in wastewater 	 Leading European and international experts will meet in Lisbon from 26–27 October to review the state of the art of the rapidly developing scientific area of wastewater-based epidemiology (1). They will be gathering at ‘Testing the waters 2017’, the third international conference on wastewater analysis, organised by the SCORE group and the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA)(2). The conference takes place in the margins of Lisbon Addictions 2017 (3). Wastewater analysis is a novel scientific discipline with the potential for monitoring near-real-time, population-level trends in illicit drug use. By sampling a known source of wastewater, such as a sewage influent to a wastewater treatment plant, scientists can now estimate the quantity of drugs used in a community by measuring the levels of illicit drugs and their metabolites excreted in urine. The EMCDDA adopts a multi-indicator approach to drug monitoring on the principle that no single measure can provide a full picture of the drug situation. It views wastewater analysis as a valuable additional tool in its epidemiological toolkit and one which can provide timely information on a wide spectrum of substances. Echoing this rational, the conference will look at bridging the fields of wastewater‑based epidemiology and conventional drug epidemiology and examine the current applications and future perspectives for this innovative drug monitoring approach. The three keynote speeches at the conference will focus on: ‘Wastewater-based epidemiology and its practical implications in Finland’ — Teemu Gunnar, Finland ‘Using multiple data sources including wastewater analysis to understand a local drug market’ — Frank Zobel, Switzerland ‘Application of wastewater-based epidemiology in China: from wastewater monitoring to drug control efforts’ — Xiqing Li, China The conference participants will present case studies and explore novel uses of wastewater analysis (e.g. early detection of new psychoactive substances on the drug market). During the event, the organisers will award prizes for ‘Best poster’ and ‘Best paper’ to young researchers working in this area. The EMCDDA and the SCORE group have been collaborating in this area since 2011, the year when SCORE began its annual wastewater monitoring campaigns. SCORE’s latest project analysed wastewater in over 50 European cities in 18 European countries in March 2016 to explore the drug-taking behaviours of their inhabitants. The findings offered a valuable snapshot of the drug flow through the cities involved (4). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/12/testing-water-conference_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0221	2017-10-17	UNK	EMCDDA scientific award winners to present at Lisbon Addictions 2017 	 Winners of the 2017 EMCDDA scientific award will gather in Lisbon on 25 October for the seventh annual award ceremony hosted by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA)(1). The acclaimed writers will receive a non-monetary prize and present their articles during the conference Lisbon Addictions 2017, convening next week in the Portuguese capital (2).

EMCDDA_UNK_0222	2017-10-10	UNK	EMCDDA launches new online resources to support drug policy evaluation 	 Evaluation is essential for effective policymaking, helping to ensure that policies and programmes have the desired effect, provide value for money and do not bring negative unintended consequences. The value of evaluation has been recognised in all EU drug strategies and in the strategies of many EU Member States. Today, the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) launches a new package of online resources designed to inform and support those considering, or involved in, drug policy evaluation. The new web area provides access to a wide range of materials, including Evaluating drug policy: a seven-step guide to support the commissioning and managing of evaluations. A timeline of EU drug strategies and action plans and their evaluation (1990–2017) is also presented, along with an overview of national drug strategy evaluation in 30 countries up to 2016 (EU 28, Turkey and Norway). The web area, which links to additional resources, is targeted at EU and national drug policymakers and planners as well as researchers and professionals working in the drugs field. Evaluating drug policy is a challenging task. The EMCDDA supports the European Commission in its evaluations of the EU drug strategies and action plans. It is also increasingly called upon to assist governments in evaluating national drug strategies. The resources released today reflect the aims of the EMCDDA Strategy 2025, which promises to provide the agency’s customers with tailored products and services to help them achieve their goals (including evaluating policies and strategies). The seven-step guide states its aim as being ‘to assist people in choosing the best approach to suit their circumstances and to maximise the value of any evaluation’. It stresses that ‘the choice of approach depends on many factors, including timing, objectives and the availability of resources’. The guide begins by discussing the need for preparing the ground (e.g. leadership buy-in, stakeholder engagement), choosing the type and scope of the evaluation and building the evaluation team. It goes on to explore evaluation design (e.g. research questions and methods, logic models and data requirements), monitoring progress and finally making use of results and building an evaluative culture. The current EU Drugs Strategy (2013–20) underlines the role of evaluation as a key element in strengthening the EU approach to drugs. The EU Action Plan on Drugs (2017–20) requires the EU Member States, European Commission and the EMCDDA to promote scientific evaluations of policies and interventions at national, EU and international level (Action 47)(1). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/fs9/drug-policy-evaluation_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0223	2017-09-29	UNK	Acryloylfentanyl to be placed under control across the EU	 This week, the EU has reacted to serious concerns over the use of the synthetic opioid acryloylfentanyl by deciding to subject it to ‘control measures’ throughout the Union (1). The implementing decision of the Council of the EU (2) was adopted in the final stage of the three-step legal procedure designed to respond to potentially threatening new psychoactive substances (NPS) available on the market (3)(4). The substance in question has been raising health concerns in Europe after harmful effects related to its use were reported by the Member States through the EU Early Warning System (EWS), which is implemented by the EMCDDA and Europol. The decision is based on the findings of a formal risk assessment of the drug, conducted by the extended EMCDDA Scientific Committee on 22 February 2017, with participation of additional experts from the EU Member States, European Commission, Europol and the European Medicines Agency. The risk assessment report assessed the health and social risks of the drug, as well as international trafficking and the involvement of organised crime (5). It concluded that the high potency of the substance constitutes a serious risk of acute toxicity through respiratory depression. Acryloylfentanyl is structurally related to fentanyl, which is a controlled substance widely used in medicine as an adjunct to general anaesthesia during surgery and for pain management. Clinical experience suggests that naloxone works as an antidote to poisoning caused by acryloylfentanyl. Available in the EU since at least April 2016, acryloylfentanyl is sold as a ‘research chemical’, and has been seized in tablet, capsule and liquid form, including ready-to-use nasal sprays. At the time of the risk assessment (February 2017), it had been detected in six EU Member States, with 47 deaths associated with the substance reported by three EU countries. Today, the decision on subjecting this substance to control measures has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union. Member States will have one year to introduce the controls into national legislation. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/8/acryloylfentanyl-under-control-accross-eu_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0224	2017-09-25	UNK	Upcoming European guide on health and social responses to drug problems	 Health and social responses to drug problems in Europe will be placed in the spotlight next month in a pioneering new EMCDDA guide to be launched on 24 October during Lisbon Addictions 2017. Health and social responses to drug problems: a European guide is designed to provide an overview of actions or interventions undertaken to address the negative consequences associated with the illicit drug phenomenon. It also acts as a gateway to a wide range of online resources, including links to evidence and tools. The purpose of the guide is to help those involved in tackling drug problems to develop new programmes or improve existing services. Designed to serve as a reference document, it incorporates summaries and user-friendly signposting to highlight key information, best practice examples and implications for policy and practice. The guide looks at the issue from diverse perspectives, including responding to: problems associated with different types of drug and patterns of use; the needs of different groups (e.g. women, young people, asylum seekers); and problems in different settings (e.g. prisons, festivals, schools, workplace). The publication presents a framework for developing interventions and explores options for supporting their successful implementation (e.g. using evidence and quality standards). This resource will be valuable, both to those approaching drug problems from a public health planning perspective (local and national), as well as to frontline workers and responders. The publication, which draws on inputs from 30 countries (28 EU, Turkey and Norway), will be available in English in print, pdf and e-pub formats. Launch details Date: 24 October 2017Time: The report will be launched online at 11.00 Central European Time/CET (10.00 Western European Time/WET, Lisbon time)Find out more: www.emcdda.europa.eu/responses-guide 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/7/coming-soon-responses-guide_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0225	2017-09-12	UNK	EMCDDA signs accord with Swiss Federal Office of Public Health 	 Europe’s regional monitoring system on drugs is enriched today, thanks to a new working arrangement signed in Lisbon between the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the Federal Office of Public Health of Switzerland (FOPH). The signatories were Alexis Goosdeel, EMCDDA Director and Pascal Strupler, Director of the FOPH). The new arrangement will contrbute to a comprehensive overview of the European drugs problem and help enhance comparability of drug data between Switzerland and the EU. The document is in line with the EMCDDA Strategy 2025, which stresses that the agency should develop its services in partnership with national, European and international actors working in the drugs field in order to fulfil its role as the leading EU provider of evidence on drugs (1). The FOPH — responsible for evaluating and coordinating the Swiss federal policy on illicit drugs — formally requested closer scientific cooperation with the EMCDDA in August 2015. The working arrangement was endorsed by the EMCDDA Management Board in June 2017, following consultation with the European Commission. It takes place within the agency’s mandate for cooperation with third (non-EU) countries and will be implemented through a joint work programme (2). The agreement includes steps to enhance the knowledge base on the drug situation and responses to it, through cooperation in the area of data-collection methodology and through data sharing in key areas (e.g. demand and demand reduction, supply and supply reduction, legal aspects and policy models). It also allows the two bodies to exchange experience on health and social responses to drug problems (e.g. harm reduction, social integration and preventing communicable diseases), a topic in the spotlight next month when the EMCDDA launches its first European guide on the issue (3). Today’s accord also pays special attention to the exchange of expertise and data in the area of new psychoactive substances (NPS). This will include collaboration between the Swiss National Reference Laboratory and the EMCDDA’s European Database on New Drugs. The two bodies recognise that information on the drug phenomenon is an essential and indispensable instrument for drafting and implementing drug policies and for assessing the impact of actions to reduce problems originating from drug use and trafficking. The information obtained through the new working arrangement will provide both parties with valuable new insights and contribute to their ongoing strategic goals. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/fs8/swiss_working-arrangement_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0226	2017-09-01	UNK	Washington State Institute reports on cannabis legalisation	 As part of the legalisation in Washington State that took effect in July 2014, the state legislature instructed the Washington State Institute of Public Policy (WSIPP) to publish periodic evaluations looking at factors in (at least) six named areas. These should inform a benefit-cost evaluation of the law. On Friday 1 September, WSIPP published its report for 2017. The report lists preliminary findings for: cannabis use by youth (2016 data) and adults (2015 data), cannabis use treatment admissions (2016 data), and drug law offence convictions (2016 data). Data for other areas have yet to be obtained, or have been obtained but not yet fully analysed. The analysis compares (a) the different counties within the State, noting per capita cannabis sales; and (b) Washington State with other similar states. Sales data do not represent all legal cannabis supply; home growing is allowed in Washington State for authorised medical (but not recreational) use. However, the medical and non-medical markets were integrated in July 2016, and now distinguishing the two is nearly impossible. Drug use rates In schools, use has been stable or fallen slightly, and cannabis is viewed as more difficult to access. There was no evidence that the amount of legal cannabis sales in a county affected cannabis use among school students, though 8th-graders in districts with more sales per capita were significantly less likely to report smoking cigarettes. For adults, cannabis use has increased, whereas heavy alcohol use and cigarette use have remained stable or fallen. Those aged 21 and older living in counties with more sales per capita were significantly more likely to report current use (last 30 days) and heavy use (on 20 or more of the past 30 days). By contrast, those aged 18–20 living in counties with more sales were significantly less likely to report use of cannabis in the past 30 days, but the likelihood of heavy use was unaffected. Treatment demand The number of state-funded admissions for cannabis use in Washington has been falling since 2008, and continues to do so. However, for those who were not referred by criminal justice, cannabis use admissions only started to decline in 2011. There is no evidence that the legalisation caused this change, or that the amount of sales in a county affected the number of cannabis abuse treatment admissions. Convictions for cannabis possession Cannabis possession remains illegal for those under 21. Nevertheless, misdemeanour cannabis possession convictions for this age group began to decline in 2012, reaching approximately half the level they had been over the previous 10 years. There was no evidence of effects of retail sales rates on convictions.

EMCDDA_UNK_0227	2017-08-30	UNK	Preventing and reducing drug overdoses — a priority for the EMCDDA	 International Overdose Awareness Day is an annual event, held on 31 August, to raise awareness of overdose and reduce the stigma of drug-related death (1). The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) marks the day by highlighting its latest figures on overdose deaths in Europe and expressing support for interventions that prevent such harms. Latest evidence from the EMCDDA shows that drug overdose deaths in Europe have risen for the third consecutive year (2). A total of 8 441 overdose deaths, mainly related to heroin and other opioids, are estimated to have occurred in Europe in 2015 (28 EU, Turkey and Norway), representing a 6% increase on the 2014 figure of 7 950 in the 30 countries. Preliminary data for 2016 suggest that this increasing trend is continuing. Europe’s 1.3 million problem opioid users are among the most vulnerable. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘Through its Strategy 2025, the EMCDDA is committed to contributing to a healthier Europe by acting as a catalyst for improving the quality and delivery of responses to reduce the health and social consequences of drug use. This requires us to keep abreast of new prevention, treatment and harm-reduction approaches and support our stakeholders in identifying and adopting best practices. One of our priorities is to help tackle the thousands of premature and preventable drug-related deaths that occur every year’. Heroin, often taken with other substances, is present in the majority of fatal overdoses reported in Europe, with the most recent data showing a rise in heroin-related deaths in several European countries. North America has also experienced rising levels of heroin use and considerable morbidity and mortality associated with the misuse of prescription opioids. In Europe and North America, highly potent synthetic opioids, which mimic the effects of heroin and morphine, are also growing health threat. While representing a small share of the market, there are increasing reports of the emergence of these substances and of the harms they cause, including non-fatal intoxications and deaths. Twenty-five new synthetic opioids were detected in Europe between 2009 and 2016 (18 of these were fentanils, which are subject to particular scrutiny). Preventing drug-related harms and offering effective treatment to those with substance use problems are central pillars of Europe’s response to drugs. A strong evidence base supports the appropriate use of opioid substitution treatment (OST) to reduce morbidity and mortality. Good clinical practice and understanding how to reduce the diversion of prescription opioids from their legitimate use are crucial to reap the health benefits of this treatment approach. Interventions to prevent overdoses in Europe include supervised drug consumption room (DCRs), which aim to prevent overdoses from occurring and ensure professional support if an overdose occurs. DCRs now operate in six EU countries and Norway (78 facilities in total). In recent years, there has been a growth in the provision of ‘take-home’ naloxone (opioid overdose-reversal drug) to opioid users, their peers and families, alongside training in recognising and responding to overdose. Take-home naloxone programmes now exist in nine EU countries and Norway. The EMCDDA — together with the EU Member States, Turkey and Norway — is constantly working on this issue (see ‘Related links’ below). From 18–20 September, the agency will hold its annual expert meeting on drug-related deaths to share the latest information in this field and to reflect on current experience and practice in reducing drug-related deaths in Europe.

EMCDDA_UNK_0228	2017-07-31	UNK	United States: Legalisation stalls in Vermont and Delaware	 As legislators depart for their summer break, in two US states that do not have the ability to pass laws by popular vote, draft laws (‘bills’) for cannabis legalisation have yet to win approval. In Vermont, House Bill S.22 proposed a model similar to that adopted in Washington DC. Sale of cannabis would not be permitted, but it would be legal to possess and use a small amount (1 oz, 28 g of cannabis herb or 5 g of cannabis resin) and to cultivate plants screened from public view (two mature and four immature per ‘dwelling unit’). As the House preferred home growing and the state Senate preferred a system of commercial retail, this bill was a compromise; it established a Marijuana Regulatory Commission, which would take six months to elaborate a framework for possible retail sale. The bill was approved by the state Senate in April and by the House in May. However, at the end of May the state governor vetoed the bill, sending it back for a rewrite as he considered that it lacked adequate safety measures. There was thepossibility that it could be addressed in a special session in July, but this did not happen. In Delaware, House Bill 110 proposed a model similar to that adopted in the state of Washington. Its stated aims included promoting individual freedom, raising revenue, and allowing law enforcement to focus on violent and property crimes. To protect public health, it would regulate cannabis like alcohol (licensed sales, age limits, product testing). It would allow possession of up to 1 oz (28 g) of cannabis herb, and create a system of licensing for shops to sell it, but home growing would not be allowed. It was put forward in March and approved by committee in May, but as the bill introduced new criminal penalties, it required a two-thirds vote in both houses of the General Assembly to pass. This did not seem likely, and by the beginning of July, the bill was not advanced for a full vote. However, the legislature created a task force that would consider key concerns such as impaired driving and consumer safety, and this should report back by January 2018 for the next session of the General Assembly. According to SAMHSA NSDUH studies, Vermont has one of the highest rates of cannabis use out of all the states, with 20.8 % of adults reporting use in the last year. Delaware reported a considerably lower rate, with 13.1 %. For comparison, the range across the 50 states is 8.6–23.9 %. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/united-states-legalisation-stalls-in-vermont-and-delaware_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0229	2017-07-28	UNK	#WorldHepatitisDay: EMCDDA joins forces with partners to address viral hepatitis elimination targets	 Every year, on 28 July, the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners mark World Hepatitis Day (WHD) to increase awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis and the diseases it causes. WHD unites patient organisations, governments, medical professionals, civil society, industry and the general public to boost the global profile of viral hepatitis. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘The prevalence of antibodies to the hepatitis C virus commonly ranges between 40% and 80% in national samples of injecting drug users in the EU Member States. People who inject drugs frequently accumulate risks, which can increase the likelihood of developing liver‑related problems. Although there are effective treatments available to cure HCV infection, these therapeutic options do not cover enough injecting drug users in Europe. Testing is also insufficient and many remain undiagnosed. The EMCDDA, through its new Strategy 2025, is committed to contributing to a healthier Europe by acting as a catalyst for improving the quality and delivery of responses to reduce the health and social consequences of drug use.’ Under the theme ‘Eliminate hepatitis’, WHD 2017 aims to accelerate progress towards achieving the goal of elimination by 2030 (see Drugnet Europe 99). To encourage people to feel empowered, personally connected and understand their role in elimination, the theme is brought to life through the #ShowYourFace campaign. This personalised photo campaign focuses on individual human faces to highlight that hepatitis is relevant to everyone, everywhere in the world and that helping to eliminate it is something to be supported by all.

EMCDDA_UNK_0231	2017-06-26	UNK	Sixth European drugs summer school kicks off in Lisbon with record number of students	 The sixth European drugs summer school (EDSS) — ‘Illicit drugs in Europe: demand, supply and public policies’ — opens today in Lisbon on International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking (1)(2). The two-week course (26 June–7 July), is a joint initiative of the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL) and is supported by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)(3). This year, the EDSS has reached its maximum capacity with a record 50 participants enrolled from some 25 countries. Through a multidisciplinary and interactive approach to the drugs problem, EMCDDA scientific experts, leading academics, guest speakers and policymakers, will prepare participants to meet the complex policy challenges in this field. The theme in focus this year will be ‘Preventing and reducing mortality’. Speaking today in Lisbon, EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel said: ‘I am delighted to open our sixth European drugs summer school and to welcome a record number of participants and speakers for two weeks of lively debate around preventing and reducing drug-related mortality. As our latest European Drug Report shows, this theme is particularly relevant and timely, as overdose deaths rise for the third year in a row and concerns grow over the threat posed by highly potent synthetic opioids’. Goosdeel adds: ‘Today the United Nations promotes its Listen FIRST campaign to support evidence-based prevention interventions as an investment in the wellbeing of children, young people, their families and communities. Through careful listening, parents, teachers, policymakers and prevention workers can play a vital role in reducing the development of drug use and risky behaviours. We must also listen to the more chronic drug users who are attempting to control or reduce their substance use. It is important that they can voice their needs and describe the obstacles they face in changing their behaviour’. Week 1 of the summer school, dedicated to ‘Drug problems: market, substances, use and harms’, will feature lectures on: the global burden of drug-related problems; drug markets in Europe; drug prevention and treatment; drug-related deaths; reducing drug-related harms (including an address from the coordinator of the Estonian community-based naloxone distribution programme) and new and emerging drug trends in Europe. Also covered will be drug-related infectious diseases and acute drug toxicity in hospital emergency services and drug-related research in Europe (4). Week 2, dedicated to ‘Evidence-based policymaking for drug-related issues’, will include lectures on: drug policies (concepts, issues and analysis); the role of the EU in international drug policy; monitoring supply reduction and drug enforcement activity; the cost of drug policy; drug laws; the production and geopolitics of drugs; and the link between evidence and decision-making. Over the two weeks, the students will participate in study visits to outreach facilities (mobile methadone unit; harm reduction centre) and will meet members of the Lisbon ‘Commission for dissuasion’ (5). During the course, they will also attend interactive workshops to discuss their own projects and views. The proceedings will close with an open debate on the ‘UNGASS outcome document — what next?’(6), featuring keynote speeches from João Goulão, Portuguese National Drug Coordinator and Owen Bowden-Jones, Chair of the UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). These will build on an earlier address ‘Putting commitments into practice — the CND-led post-UNGASS process’, by Ambassador Moitinho de Almeida, appointed by the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs as facilitator for post-UNGASS matters. Other keynote speeches include: ‘Models of addiction: why do people use drugs?’ — Robert West, Addiction Journal; ‘Women and drugs: gender specificities and an example of setting up drug services for women’ — Florence Mabileau, Council of Europe Pompidou Group; ‘Choose your drug problem: the dilemmas of drug policymaking’ — Keith Humphreys, Stanford School of Medicine, USA (video lecture) and EMCDDA staff; ‘Law enforcement against drug production in Europe’ — Bernard van Camp, Police commissioner, Belgium and EMCDDA staff. Previous rounds of the summer school have brought together students from the EU Member States as well as from Africa, Asia, Australia and the Americas. Profiles of former alumni and their testimonials can be found on the official summer school website and their statements viewed in a promotional video (7). The EMCDDA and ISCTE-IUL renewed their Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on 10 May 2017 in Lisbon, the first having been signed in 2011 ahead of the inaugural European drugs summer school in 2012. The new MoU, signed for a period of five years, aims to: promote effective cooperation in academic and scientific activities in areas of common interest; and enhance the scientific, technical and human capacity and potential of the two organisations (8). The EMCDDA Strategy 2025, underlines how the agency’s partnerships with universities, research centres and scientific bodies allows it to maintain a close and ongoing understanding of research developments (9). The summer school is a prime example of such collaboration, enriching us with insights from students, researchers and professionals working on drug issues worldwide. The EMCDDA marks 26 June with its annual event at its premises for the Lisbon diplomatic community and its partners from the Portuguese authorities. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/fs6/european-drugs-summer-school-2017_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0232	2017-06-21	UNK	EMCDDA conference to take stock of achievements as IPA5 project draws to a close	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) is organising a conference in Sarajevo today marking the end of a two-year technical cooperation project with beneficiary countries of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA)(1). The conference is being held in association with the Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Delegation of the EU to the country. Deputy Minister of Security, Mijo Krešić will attend the opening session (2). The EU-funded project (IPA5)(3), operating within the framework of the EU Enlargement Policy (4), was designed to prepare candidate and potential candidate countries to the EU for future participation in the work of the EMCDDA. Kicking off in July 2015, it promoted knowledge transfer and capacity building in the area of drug monitoring and provided scientific support for information collection and analysis and for product development corresponding to national, EU and EMCDDA needs. The IPA5 beneficiary countries are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo*, Montenegro and Serbia. The project goals included: Objective 1: consolidate cooperation with each IPA beneficiary at institutional level; Objective 2: foster scientific cooperation in data collection, analysis and interpretation; Objective 3: develop, increase and promote the added value of the cooperation. The conference will look at how these objectives were implemented as well as related activities, lessons learned and next steps. The event will gather around 55 participants from the Western Balkan region representing a range of institutions (e.g. Ministries of health, internal affairs and the interior; customs authorities; forensic laboratories; public health institutes; the police; universities and clinics). Under Objective 1, the EMCDDA organised national stakeholder meetings in each of the six beneficiary country capital cities to ensure national adherence to the project goals and expected outcomes. Activities under Objective 2 included a data-collection exercise on assessing drug seizure data in the region, which included training sessions and analysis of national data. In cooperation with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the EMCDDA supported the assessment of drug treatment availability and service needs at national level by helping interested countries carry out drug treatment facility surveys. Also financed under the project was the implementation of the first national general population survey in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in Montenegro. The EMCDDA supported countries in developing national early-warning systems on new psychoactive substances (NPS) under Objective 3. Coaches from selected EU Member States were assigned to the interested beneficiary countries to implement capacity-development activities with key stakeholders. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/fs5/ipa5-final-conference_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0233	2017-06-12	UNK	EMCDDA and ECDC join forces to address the challenge of hepatitis 	 Hepatitis and other drug-related infectious diseases will be the focus of ‘Hepatitis week’, taking place at the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in Lisbon from 12–16 June (1). The initiative will bring together some 100 specialists from: EU Member States, candidate and potential candidate countries to the EU, as well as partner agencies, civil society and professional organisations.  Viral hepatitis, particularly infection caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), is highly prevalent among injecting drug users across Europe. For every 100 people infected with HCV (antibody-positive), 75 to 80 will develop chronic infection (2). The week will kick off with a two-day meeting of the hepatitis B and C network of the Stockholm-based EU agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) (12–13 June). It will close with the regular annual meeting of the EMCDDA drug-related infectious diseases (DRID) network of national experts (15–16 June).  A joint session on 14 June will provide the two networks with an opportunity to share expertise and experience and to discuss how Europe can improve its surveillance of, and response to, hepatitis among people who inject drugs (PWID). The experts will also discuss practical evidence-based strategies, share examples of good practice and identify solutions to common challenges.  Through plenary and ‘World Café’ interactive sessions, Hepatitis week will allow both expert networks to address the topics of epidemiology, responses and monitoring and share and discuss new studies, findings and experiences at regional, national and European level. The initiative will also facilitate technical work around the collection and analysis of the different components of the EMCDDA DRID key epidemiological indicator, namely: prevalence of infections among people using drugs; surveillance of diagnoses and testing; and behavioural data.  EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘The prevalence of antibodies to the hepatitis C virus commonly ranges between 40% and 80% in national samples of injecting drug users in the EU Member States. People who inject drugs frequently accumulate risks, which can increase the likelihood of developing liver-related problems. Although there are now treatments available to cure HCV infection, these therapeutic options do not cover enough injecting drug users in Europe. Testing also remains insufficient and late diagnosis is widespread. The EMCDDA, through its new Strategy 2025, is committed to contributing to a healthier Europe by acting as a catalyst for improving the quality and delivery of responses to reduce the health and social consequences of drug use.’ Piotr Kamarz, Deputy Chief Scientist of ECDC says: ‘Bringing these networks together provides us with a great opportunity to draw on the wealth of expertise existing in Europe. It will also help us to move the public health agenda forward around hepatitis prevention and control among people who inject drugs. The elimination of hepatitis B and C in Europe is a huge challenge, especially among drug users, and this meeting will allow for discussion around practical strategies to tackle the problem. Collaboration, communication and the sharing of good practice, through events such as this, are essential if the goal of elimination is to be achieved’.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/fs4/hepatitis-week-june-2017_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0234	2017-06-06	UNK	EMCDDA highlights growing threats posed by new and established substances 	 Rising overdose deaths, the continued availability of new psychoactive substances and the growing health threat of highly potent synthetic opioids are among the issues highlighted today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) as it launches its European Drug Report 2017: Trends and Developments in Brussels (1). In its annual overview, the agency also explores: signs of rising cocaine availability; developments in cannabis policies; and substance use among school students. As the drug problems facing Europe are increasingly influenced by developments occurring internationally, the analysis is placed in the global context. Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, says: ‘The impact of the drugs problem continues to be a significant challenge for European societies. Over 93 million Europeans have tried an illicit drug in their lives and overdose deaths continue to rise for the third year in a row. I am especially concerned that young people are exposed to many new and dangerous drugs. Already 25 highly potent synthetic opioids were detected in Europe between 2009 and 2016, of which only small volumes are needed to produce many thousands of doses, thus posing a growing health threat. The annual European Drug Report gives us the necessary analysis, guidance and tools to tackle this threat together across Europe, not just to protect the health of our citizens, but also to stop huge profits from drugs ending up in the pockets of organised crime groups in Europe and beyond.’ Overdose deaths on the rise for third consecutive year Today’s report highlights concern over the increasing number of drug overdose deaths in Europe, which has risen for the third consecutive year. A total of 8 441 overdose deaths, mainly related to heroin and other opioids, are estimated to have occurred in Europe in 2015 (28 EU, Turkey and Norway — Infographic, p. 77), a 6% increase on the estimated 7 950 deaths in the 30 countries in 2014. Increases were reported in almost all age groups (Figure 3.12). Rises in overdose deaths in 2015 are reported in Germany, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK and Turkey. Europe’s 1.3 million problem opioid users are among the most vulnerable. Infographic Figure 3.12 Opioids used in substitution treatment — primarily methadone and buprenorphine — are also regularly found in toxicological reports. Latest data show that the number of recorded methadone-related deaths exceeded heroin-related deaths in Denmark, Ireland, France and Croatia, underlining the need for good clinical practice to prevent diversion of these substances from their legitimate use (2). Interventions to prevent overdoses in Europe include supervised drug consumption room (DCRs) and the provision of ‘take-home’ naloxone (opioid overdose-reversal drug) to opioid users, their peers and families (3). DCRs now operate in six EU countries (DK, DE, ES, FR, LU, NL) and Norway (78 facilities in total for the seven countries) (4). Take-home naloxone programmes now exist in nine EU countries (DK, DE, EE, IE, ES, FR, IT, LT, UK) and Norway (5). New drugs emerging at a slower pace, but overall availability still high New psychoactive substances (NPS/‘new drugs’) remain a considerable public health challenge in Europe. Not covered by international drug controls, they include a broad range of synthetic substances, including cannabinoids, cathinones, opioids and benzodiazepines. Figure 1.10 In 2016, 66 NPS were detected for the first time via the EU Early Warning System (EWS) — a rate of over one per week (Figure 1.10). Although this number points to a slowing of the pace at which new substances are being introduced onto the market — 98 substances were detected in 2015 — the overall number of substances now available remains high. By the end of 2016, the EMCDDA was monitoring more than 620 NPS (compared with around 350 in 2013). The slower rate of new detections in Europe may be attributed to a number of factors. New legislation in some Member States (e.g. blanket bans, generic and analogue-based controls) has created a more restrictive legal environment, in which there may be less incentive for producers to engage in a‘cat-and-mouse game’ with regulators, where innovation is used to keep ahead of controls. Law-enforcement operations and control measures targeting NPS laboratories in China may also be contributing to the slowdown. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘Our latest findings suggest that responses to new psychoactive substances, such as new legislation and measures targeting the high-street shops that sell these products, may be having an impact on the emergence of NPS on the market. But despite positive signs of a slowdown in product innovation, overall availability remains high. We are seeing sales of these drugs becoming more clandestine, with transactions moving online or onto the illicit drug market, and we have witnessed the recent appearance of some highly potent substances, which have been linked to deaths and serious intoxications’. In 2015, almost 80 000 seizures of NPS were reported through the EWS (Figure 1.11). Together, synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic cathinones accounted for over 60% of all seizures of new substances in 2015 (over 47 000). In July 2016, MDMB-CHMICA became the first synthetic cannabinoid to be risk-assessed by the EMCDDA after harmful effects (including around 30 deaths) related to its use were reported via the EWS. This resulted in a decision in February 2017 to subject the substance to Europe-wide control measures (6). Figure 1.11 Accompanying today’s report is a new analysis of High-risk drug use and new psychoactive substances, which focuses on the problematic use of NPS among a range of demographic groups, including: opioid and amphetamine injectors; prisoners; the homeless; and men who have sex with men. The report explores, in particular, the use of synthetic cathinones, synthetic cannabinoids and new synthetic opioids, as well as related harms and responses (7). New synthetic opioids — highly potent and a growing health threat In Europe, as in North America, highly potent synthetic opioids, which mimic the effects of heroin and morphine, are a growing health threat. While representing a small share of the market, there are increasing reports of the emergence of these substances and of the harms they cause, including non-fatal intoxications and deaths. Twenty-five new synthetic opioids were detected in Europe between 2009 and 2016 (18 of these were fentanils). With only small volumes needed to produce many thousands of street doses, new synthetic opioids are easy to conceal and transport, posing a challenge for drug control agencies and a potentially attractive commodity for organised crime. They are found in various forms — mainly powders, tablets and capsules — with some now available as liquids and sold as nasal sprays. Fentanils are subject to particular scrutiny. These exceptionally potent substances — some many times more potent than heroin — accounted for over 60% of the 600 seizures of new synthetic opioids reported in 2015. Eight new fentanils were reported through the EWS for the first time in 2016 alone. These substances pose a serious risk of intoxication, not only to users but also to those who may be accidentally exposed to these drugs (e.g. via skin contact, inhalation), such as postal and customs workers and emergency service personnel. Early in 2017, the EMCDDA carried out risk assessments of two fentanils (acryloylfentanyl and furanyl-fentanyl), after over 50 deaths associated with these substances were reported (8). These are now being considered for control at European level (9). The agency issued five health alerts in 2016 to its network across Europe related to these, and other, new fentanils. Signs of rising cocaine availability Europe’s most commonly used illicit stimulant drugs are cocaine, MDMA (sometimes referred to as ‘ecstasy’ in tablet form) and amphetamines (amphetamine and methamphetamine). Cocaine use is higher in western and southern European countries — reflected in ports of entry and trafficking routes — while use of amphetamines is more prominent in northern and eastern Europe. The stimulant market has become increasingly complex in recent years, with the arrival of new stimulants (e.g. phenethylamines and cathinones). Data from wastewater monitoring and on seizures, price and purity suggest that the availability of cocaine may be rising again in parts of Europe (Figure 2.4). Both the number of seizures and the quantity seized increased between 2014 and 2015 (Figure 1.6). Some 87 000 seizures of cocaine were reported in the EU in 2015 (76 000 in 2014), amounting to 69.4 tonnes seized (51.5 tonnes in 2014)(Infographic, p. 26). At city level, a study analysing municipal wastewater for cocaine residues showed a stable or increasing longer-term trend in most of the 13 cities with data between 2011 and 2016. Of the 33 cities with data for 2015 and 2016, 22 cities reported an increase in cocaine residues, four a decrease and seven a stable situation (10). Figure 2.4 Figure 1.6 Infographic Around 17.5 million European adults (15–64 years) have tried cocaine at some time in their lives. Of these, around 2.3 million are young adults (15–34 years) who have used the drug in the last year. National surveys since 2014 show levels of cocaine use to be primarily stable. Global cannabis policy developments: what implications for Europe? Figure 2.2 Recent changes in the regulatory framework for cannabis occurring in parts of the Americas have generated interest among policymakers and the public in Europe (11). ‘There is a need to wait for robust evaluations before the relative costs and benefits of differing cannabis policy approaches can be assessed’, states the report. Within the 28 EU Member States, current approaches to cannabis regulation and use are diverse, ranging from restrictive models to the tolerance of some forms of personal use (12). However, no national government in Europe (EU 28, Turkey and Norway) has currently expressed support for the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use. Regardless of any wider impact on drug policy, the existence of a commercially regulated cannabis market in some countries outside Europe is fuelling innovation and product development (e.g. vaporisers, e-liquids, edible products), which may, in time, impact on patterns of use in Europe. Here the report underlines the importance of monitoring and the need to evaluate the potential health implications of any future changes. Some 87.7 million European adults (15–64 years) have tried cannabis in their lifetime. Of these, an estimated 17.1 million are young Europeans (15–34 years) who have used cannabis in the last year. Around 1% of European adults are daily or almost daily cannabis users (use on 20 days or more in the last month). The most recent survey results show that countries continue to follow divergent paths in last-year cannabis use (Figure 2.2). Cannabis continues to be associated with health problems and is now responsible for the greatest share (45%) of new entrants to drug treatment in Europe (28 EU, Turkey and Norway). Overall, the number of reported first-time treatment entrants for cannabis problems rose from 43 000 in 2006 to 76 000 in 2015. EU and US: school student substance use compared Monitoring substance use among school students offers valuable insight into current youth risk behaviours and potential future trends. This year’s report compares long-term patterns of substance use among European and American students (15–16 years), following the release of two major school surveys in 2016 (13). The surveys show smoking and drinking among school students in Europe and the US to be declining, while trends in cannabis use appear to be more stable. Last-month cannabis use among the European school students surveyed (21 EU countries and Norway), was around half the level (8%) of that reported in the US (15%) (Graphic, p. 13). Last-month tobacco use was almost four times higher among students in Europe (23%) than in the US, where it was low at 6%. Tobacco use among US students was less than half the level of cannabis use in this group. The percentage of European students reporting last-month alcohol use was more than double (49%) that reported by their American peers (22%). Graphic ‘Further analysis of both the similarities and differences in the students’ substance use is needed to explore the relative influence of the social, contextual and regulatory factors on the choices made by young people’, states the report. ‘Understanding, for example, what has led to the reductions in cigarette smoking in both the United States and Europe may offer insights for addressing the use of other substances, such as cannabis’, it adds. Spotlight on national drug situations Today’s report will be complemented for the first time by 30 Country Drug Reports, presenting summaries of national drug phenomena (EU 28, Turkey and Norway). Developed by the EMCDDA, in cooperation with the Reitox national focal points, these graphic-rich reports cover: drug use and public health problems; drug policy and responses; and drug supply (14). Key features include an ‘At a glance’ table, summarising the national drug problem in figures, and an ‘EU dashboard’, placing the country data in the European context. --- Chair of the EMCDDA Management Board Laura d’Arrigo concludes: ‘As the drug phenomenon continues to evolve, so too must Europe’s responses. The first step towards achieving this is an understanding of the challenges we face: the EMCDDA strives to provide the best possible evidence on the drug situation across Europe. The data presented this year in the European Drug Report compare national situations and clearly highlight emerging threats, helping decision-makers to act effectively. The EMCDDA’s analyses are crucial to ensure that the new EU action plan on drugs for the next four years remains relevant. Promoting an evidence-based culture in drug policymaking is a key contribution to a healthier and more secure Europe.’ 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/6/european-drug-report-2017-highlights_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0235	2017-05-10	UNK	EMCDDA renews accord with ISCTE-IUL 	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL) will be strengthening their cooperation in future thanks to a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the two bodies today in Lisbon. The signatories were Rector of ISCTE-IUL Professor Luís Antero Reto and EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel. The EMCDDA and ISCTE-IUL signed their first MoU in 2011, ahead of the first European Drugs Summer School (EDSS) organised by the two partners in 2012. The organisations are currently preparing the sixth EDSS, to take place in Lisbon from 26 June to 7 July (1). Signed for a period of five years, the new MoU aims to: promote effective cooperation in academic and scientific activities in areas of common interest; and enhance the scientific, technical and human capacity and potential of the two organisations. The MoU includes opportunities for: the exchange of scientific experts and university professors (for teaching and research purposes); the exchange of information, knowledge and expertise in areas of common interest; collaborative research, lectures, symposia and similar activities; joint academic programmes (including summer schools) and trainee exchanges. The 2017 MoU is in line with the recently published EMCDDA Strategy 2025, which states that the EMCDDA’s partnerships with universities, research centres and scientific bodies, among others, allow the agency to maintain a close and ongoing understanding of developments in the research area (2). Such partnerships to date have also supported the development of European and international standards and have facilitated the reporting and interpretation of European data at international level.     	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/fs3/mou-summer-school-iscte-emcdda_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0237	2017-04-11	UNK	Experts to examine the influence of cyberspace on criminal activities and responses to them	 Leading European and international experts will meet in Lisbon on 20–21 April for meetings around the theme of ‘The expanding influence of the internet, the exploitation of cyberspace and the transformational nature of new technologies’ (1). The events are hosted by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) as current chair of a network of nine EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies (‘JHA agencies’ network’)(2). The JHA agencies’ network was established in 2006 to boost cooperation in the migration and security fields. The nine agencies work together on a wide range of issues, including combating organised crime — such as human and drug trafficking — as well as migration and border management. The network has chosen the use of cyberspace for criminal purposes as its overarching theme for 2017. On 20 April, an expert meeting, gathering some 20 participants, will focus on the ‘The internet for criminal purposes — challenges and opportunities for the work of the JHA agencies’. The event will allow for an exchange of experience on how cyberspace has influenced criminal activities and responses to them and to identify challenges and future issues. Two working group sessions will focus on cyber-enabled crime and law enforcement, and monitoring the internet (including darknet markets). A larger conference on 21 April, bringing together over 50 participants, will be opened by EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel. A total of seven keynote speakers will address the conference across the following sessions: Internet — the big picture Cybercrime: clarifying the concept and shedding light on law-enforcement responses Monitoring open source intelligence, darknet markets and social media Speaking ahead of the conference, Alexis Goosdeel said: ‘Communication tool, information repository, training channel or marketplace? The internet today means many things to many people. While it offers countless opportunities to boost legitimate business, it also facilitates transnational organised crime. This is why this event is so important. Addressing a raft of issues, from drug supply on darknet markets to implications for migration, it will offer a wealth of informed perspectives. Crucially, it will also explore how the JHA agencies can better develop joined-up actions to respond to the common challenges posed by the internet and new technologies today’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/5/JHA-internet_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0238	2017-04-04	UNK	EMCDDA embarks on Strategy 2025	 Message from EMCDDA Director, Alexis Goosdeel The EMCDDA has published today its new Strategy 2025, which sets out an ambitious course of travel for the agency over the next decade. Our vision, and the ultimate goal of our journey, will be to contribute to a healthier and more secure Europe, through better informed drug policy and action. Adopted by the agency’s Management Board in December, following the approval of the agency’s key stakeholders in 2016, the strategy is the result of a year‑long, in‑depth analysis of the environment in which the EMCDDA operates. This analysis focused, in particular, on customer needs and a critical review of our internal capacity to meet them. This new, long‑term strategic framework will ensure, first and foremost, that the agency’s work continues to reflect the reality that Europe faces with respect to drug issues and the evolving needs of EMCDDA stakeholders. It will also ensure that the agency’s activities are supported by an internal business model which promotes appropriate and efficient working practices. In making this commitment, we are mindful of the challenges ahead of us. These challenges however — be they political uncertainties facing the EU, the difficult economic climate or the increasingly innovative means employed by the interlinked European and global drug market — make us even more aware of the importance of the EMCDDA’s work. Reflecting the multifaceted dimension of the drug phenomenon, the EMCDDA is in the privileged position to work with policymakers and practitioners, both from the health and law‑enforcement domains. We have the means to provide them with the best evidence for their decisions, which affect European citizens, particularly those touched, directly or indirectly, by drug consumption and trafficking. In order to do so, we will continue to improve our monitoring system, enriching it with novel sources of data developed with established, or new, partners in Europe and beyond. Our analyses will gain in timeliness, relevance and complexity, and our means of disseminating knowledge will reflect the fast‑evolving communication technologies and channels of the modern world. As professionals, and above all EU citizens, we aim for a healthier and more secure Europe. And we are convinced and proud that our work under this Strategy 2025 can make a clear contribution to achieving this goal. Having completed my first year as EMCDDA Director, I know that, along with my dedicated team, I can make this ambitious commitment to our stakeholders and to all Europeans who support our work. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/directors-message/strategy-2025_en

Each year, between 6 300 and 8 000 drug-induced deaths are reported in Europe. Opioids, mainly heroin or its metabolites, are present in most overdose cases. With appropriate intervention many opioid overdose deaths may be preventable. Naloxone is a life-saving overdose reversal drug that rapidly counteracts the effects of opioids. It has been used in emergency medicine in hospitals and by ambulance personnel since the 1970s to reverse the respiratory depression caused by opioid overdose.

EMCDDA_UNK_0241	2017-03-09	UNK	Euro-DEN Plus network expands reach by welcoming eight new centres	 Data from hospital emergency departments show that every year in Europe thousands of individuals experience drug-related toxicity and other harms, resulting in emergency presentations to hospital (1). Supported by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), the European Drug Emergencies Network (Euro-DEN Plus) monitors drug-related emergency presentations across Europe to provide unique insight into acute health harms related to drug use (2). In the course of 2017, the network will be expanding its reach by collecting data from new hospital ‘sentinel’ centres in eight European cities. The eight new centres — located in Antwerp, Helsinki, Kaunus, Ljubljana, Monza, Riga, Sofia and Vilnius (see map) — bring the network to a total of 29 sentinel centres in 21 European countries. The centres were strategically chosen by Euro-DEN Plus and the EMCDDA, not only to expand geographical coverage of data monitoring, but also to reinforce the network, where it had been under-represented, and to target areas where specific drug-related harms are raising concern. Euro-DEN Plus regional meeting — a focus on the Baltics Today, the EMCDDA and Euro-DEN Plus open a two-day network meeting in Tallinn (Estonia) aimed at providing an overview of the project and its data-collection model, specifically for the forthcoming centres in Latvia and Lithuania. During the meeting, the participants will take part in a roundtable on Euro-DEN Plus data collection in the Baltic region and will discuss the timeline and work plan for the contribution of the new centres. Indications of specific patterns of drug use and related harms in the Baltic region were behind the proposal for recruiting three new sentinel centres in the region in 2017: one in Latvia (Riga) and two in Lithuania (Kaunus and Vilnius). Sentinel centres have existed in Estonia (Parnü and Tallinn) since 2013. This Baltic regional meeting will finalise the formal recruitment of the three new centres into the project. Among the concerns highlighted in the region, and triggering the recruitment of the three new centres, were: the high prevalence of fentanyl use in Estonia (3); a recent increase in drug-related deaths in Lithuania (4) and signs that drug-related deaths may be underestimated in Latvia (5). In addition, there are reports across the Baltic region of: pockets of high HIV prevalence in intravenous drug users (6); and the relatively high reported prevalence of NPS in the Baltic countries in the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD)(7). The participants will include: members of the Euro-DEN Plus Steering Group; a representative of the EMCDDA; clinicians from the Estonian sentinel centres; Estonian forensic toxicologists; clinicians from the proposed new centres in Latvia and Lithuania; and representatives from the Reitox national focal points in the three Baltic countries. This broad participation is designed to facilitate discussions on how the Euro-DEN Plus data collection can serve as a novel data source, feeding into the EMCDDA’s more established monitoring of drug use and drug-related harms in the region. This week’s meeting, with the three Baltic countries, will focus in particular on improving data availability and insight into fatal and non-fatal drug toxicity, from the different perspectives of forensic toxicologists, doctors in hospital emergency rooms, the Reitox national focal points and the EMCDDA. The EMCDDA adopts a multi-indicator approach to drug monitoring on the principle that no single measure can provide a full picture of the drug situation. It views hospital emergency data-collection as a useful addition to its monitoring toolkit. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/fs2/euro-den-expands_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0242	2017-02-28	UNK	EMCDDA publishes Single Programming Document and 2017 work programme	 The EMCDDA has published today its Single Programming Document (SPD) for the period 2017–19, which includes the 2017 work programme (1). Adopted by the agency’s Management Board in December, this is the first work programme to be implemented under the new EMCDDA Strategy 2025 and follows a comprehensive consultation with the agency’s key stakeholders and partners (2). The document reflects the agency’s focus on becoming a valuable and reliable service–provider to its customers, particularly policymakers within the EU institutions and the Member States. In 2017–19, the agency will contribute to a healthier and more secure Europe, placing greater emphasis on knowledge transfer, strategic analysis and threat assessment. Among the key EMCDDA outputs this year will be European Drug Report 2017: Trends and Developments information package, complemented for the first time by 30 graphic-rich Country Drug Reports, developed with the Reitox national focal points. The first European Drug Responses Report will follow in the autumn, providing a state‑of‑the‑art overview of responses to drug use and related problems across the EU as well as implications for action. EMCDDA outputs are based on data collected through a complex European monitoring system. In 2017, the agency will aim to strike the right balance between maintaining and improving its core monitoring tasks and developing novel approaches needed to keep pace with new developments. A regulation on new psychoactive substances is expected to enter into force during the year, which will involve adjusting reporting and monitoring tools related to the EU Early Warning System and related risk assessment exercises. Two new technical assistance projects with third countries are also expected to kick off in 2017. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/3/emcdda-publishes-single-programming-document_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0243	2017-02-27	UNK	MDMB-CHMICA to be placed under control across the EU	 Today, the EU reacted to serious concerns over the use of the synthetic cannabinoid MDMB-CHMICA by deciding to subject it to ‘control measures’ throughout the Union (1). The implementing decision of the Council of the EU (2) was adopted in the final stage of the three-step legal procedure designed to respond to potentially threatening new psychoactive substances (NPS) available on the market (3)(4). The substance in question has been raising health concerns in Europe after harmful effects related to its use were reported by the Member States through the EU Early Warning System (EWS). The decision is based on the findings of a formal risk assessment of the drug, conducted by the extended EMCDDA Scientific Committee in July 2016, with participation of additional experts from the EU Member States, European Commission, Europol and the European Medicines Agency. The risk assessment report assessed the health and social risks of the drug, as well as international trafficking and the involvement of organised crime (5). It concluded that the potency of MDMB-CHMICA and the highly variable amounts of the compound encountered in herbal products constitute a serious risk of acute toxicity. MDMB-CHMICA is the first synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist to be risk-assessed by the EMCDDA. It was first reported to the EU Early Warning System in 2014. It is sold as a ‘legal’ replacement for cannabis by chemical companies and online retail shops in a variety of forms (e.g. as a powder or as commercially branded ‘legal high’ products). As of July 2016, the drug had been detected in 23 EU Member States, Turkey and Norway and had been analytically identified in samples taken from 25 intoxicated patients and 28 deceased. In 12 of the deaths, MDMB-CHMICA was reported as, either the cause of, or likely to have contributed to, the death. Recognising the threats posed by this substance, 16 EU Member States plus Turkey have already taken steps to control it under national legislation. Today’s decision on subjecting this substance to control measures will enter into force the day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. Member States will then have one year to introduce the controls into national legislation. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/3/council-decision-control-mdmb-chmica_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0244	2017-02-16	UNK	Colorado publishes report on cannabis use trends	 Following the legalisation of recreational cannabis in the US state of Colorado at the end of 2012, the state Senate mandated a report every two years on changes in cannabis use patterns, relevant scientific evidence and adverse health events. The second such report was presented to the Colorado state bodies on 30 January 2017. Some trends cover legalisation of medical cannabis from 2000, and its commercialisation from 2009 (see report for details). This 300-page report is comprehensive, yet easy to read. Section 1 on changing use patterns contains analyses of five surveys of different populations (adults, adolescents etc.), and highlights ‘major findings’ for each. Section 2 outlines the results of a review of the scientific literature on relevant topics such as cancer, cardiovascular effects, driving, mental health effects, reproductive effects and unintentional exposures in children. It summarises evidence for each topic as substantial, moderate, limited, mixed or insufficient; it also provides clear ‘Public health statements’ and ‘Public health recommendations’. Section 3 contains analyses of data from the poison and drug centre and visits to hospitals in Colorado, again highlighting ‘major findings’ for each analysis. Findings specific to Colorado included: According to two different surveys, 13 % or 17 % of adults used cannabis in the last month in 2015 (the highest national rate in the EU is 7 %, in France). This rose to 26 % of those aged 18–25. Last-month use has been rising since 2006. An estimated 6 % of adults in Colorado used cannabis daily (the highest national rate in the EU is 3 %, in Spain). About 38 % of students aged 14-18 have ever used cannabis (the highest national rate in the EU is 37 %, among 15- to 16-year-old students in Czech Republic), with nearly all usually smoking (87 %), rather than vaporising (5 %) or ingesting (2 %). In Colorado, rates of use in this age group fluctuate from 2005 to 2015. The rate of last month use is nearly identical to the US national average. There were 1688 ‘human cannabis exposure’ phone calls to the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center (RMPDC) between 2000 and 2016. Call volume significantly increased following commercialisation of medical cannabis in 2009, then further following the legalisation of commercial recreational cannabis in 2014. The number of calls decreased slightly in 2016. There were 529 cannabis-related calls to the RMPDC between July 2014 and December 2016. Of these, 203 related to edible products and 199 to smokeable products. Regarding children aged 0–8, 60 calls related to edible products and 28 to smokeable products. From 2000 until September 2015, there were increasing trends in the rates of cannabis-related hospital visits and emergency department visits. The rate of hospital visits continued to climb in 2015, but the rate of emergency department visits fell slightly compared to 2014.

The EMCDDA took over the presidency from FRA on 1 January 2017 and will chair the network until 31 December, before handing over to the Vilnius‑based European Institute for Gender Equality in 2018. The theme chosen by the JHA network for 2017 will be the internet. The nine JHA agencies (1) play key advisory, operational and coordination roles in implementing EU priorities in the areas of freedom, security and justice. They work together on a wide range of issues, including human trafficking, migration and border management, drug trafficking and combating organised crime. The first coordination meeting of the network — bringing together its members and observer members (European Commission and European External Action Service) — kicks off today in Lisbon (9–10 February). Among the issues on the agenda will be joint activities on: implementing migration, asylum and border management and internal security; training; internet and new technology; information exchange, ICT and cybersecurity: external relations; communication and engagement with European Commission-funded research. During the LIBE meeting, Alexis Goosdeel will present the new EMCDDA Strategy 2025 — adopted in December 2016 by the Management Board — as well as the programming of the agency's work for 2017–19. Michael O'Flaherty will also present FRA’s priorities for the coming year. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/director-presents-jha-priorities-at-libe-committee_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0246	2017-01-31	UNK	Reversing the HIV epidemic: Europe needs to scale-up prevention, testing and treatment	 HIV remains a significant public health problem in the 31 countries of the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA), with around 30 000 newly diagnosed HIV infections reported each year over the last decade. ​In a two-day conference organised in collaboration between the Maltese Presidency of the Council of the European Union and ECDC, HIV experts from across the European Union discuss how to reverse this trend and how to prepare Europe to achieve the set target of ending AIDS by 2030. “This conference arose from excellent collaborative work with ECDC and Malta’s commitment and recognition of the importance of placing HIV higher up on the EU agenda during its Presidency Term” says Mr Chris Fearne, Minister for Health, Malta. “We believe that concerted efforts must include all stakeholders: including governments, healthcare providers, civil society, people living with HIV and the specialised agencies like WHO and ECDC. We believe that tackling HIV is a regional, national, corporate and individual responsibility. They all have a role to play in terms of political commitment, preventive action, universal access to healthcare, affordability and access to medicines, testing, linkage to care , focus on key populations, zero tolerance to stigma AND individual behavioural responsibility.“  He added areas of action: “Scaling up of testing is essential to reach our first 90 target. We need to make better use of various settings to enhance testing, incorporate innovative approaches to testing and reduce the barriers, especially in key populations. Knowledge of HIV status ‘in unaware persons’ might also help reduce new HIV infections - those resulting negative may then take less risks, and if linked to care should achieve viral suppression, the third 90“. “If we take a look at the available data, we can see that Europe needs to improve its HIV response in several areas”, says ECDC Acting Director Andrea Ammon. “Currently, two out of three EU/EEA countries tell us that they do not have sufficient funding for prevention interventions. And every one in seven people living with HIV in the region are not aware of their infection. To reduce the number of new HIV infections in Europe, we need to focus our efforts in three main areas: prioritising prevention programmes, facilitating the uptake of HIV testing, for example by introducing new approaches like community-based testing or self-testing to diagnose those infected. And, of course, easier access to treatment for those diagnosed”. Status quo of Europe's HIV response: new ECDC report On the occasion of the Presidency meeting, ECDC publishes an overview of achievements and gaps in the European HIV response, illustrating how countries addressed the HIV epidemic in 2016, based on their commitment outlined in the Dublin Declaration on Partnership to Fight HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia.  The results show, amongst others, that HIV treatment overall starts earlier across the EU/EEA and more people receive life-saving treatment. But one in six people in the EU/EEA diagnosed with HIV are still not on treatment. Those who are on treatment, however, show how effective current HIV treatment is: almost nine out of ten people living with HIV on treatment are virally suppressed. This means the virus can no longer be detected in their blood and they cannot transmit the virus to others.  The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) contributed to this overview with data on the HIV situation and prevention coverage among people who inject drugs. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel states: “People who inject drugs have the highest proportion of late diagnosis of HIV, compared to other transmission groups. Providing voluntary testing for infectious diseases, risk behaviour counselling and assistance to manage illness at drug treatment facilities is an important additional avenue to reach this group and is among the new EU minimum quality standards for demand reduction” . The introduction and scaling up of effective drug treatment and harm reduction measures, such as needle and syringe provision, have significantly reduced drug injecting and related HIV transmission in Europe. However, this overall positive development hides large variations between countries. Marginalisation of people who inject drugs, the lack of prevention coverage, and appearance of new drugs can trigger local HIV outbreaks, as documented in five EU countries in the recent past.

EMCDDA_UNK_0248	2017-01-27	UNK	Revamped online Healthy Nightlife Toolbox goes live today	 As of today, the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) will be hosting an online Healthy Nightlife Toolbox (HNT), which collects and provides information on good-practice interventions targeting drug and alcohol use and related problems among young people in nightlife settings. The European database is designed to support prevention workers and local, regional and national policymakers in identifying and implementing effective responses in nightlife settings. Recreational settings can be locations for drug and alcohol use and are important venues for prevention measures. Estimates show last-year prevalence of drug use among regular nightclub goers to be between 4 and 25 times higher than in the same age group in the general population of the EU (1). Substance use in recreational settings is linked to a range of health and social problems. These may include acute health problems (e.g. unconsciousness, injury, violence, unsafe/unwanted sex) as well as adverse social consequences (e.g. drug dealing, public nuisance, car accidents). Presenting available evidence and best practice across Europe, the Healthy Nightlife Toolbox is a valuable resource in preventing alcohol and drug-related problems in nightlife settings. It is built around three databases focusing on: evaluated interventions (2); literature on these interventions (abstracts selected via searches of published academic literature); and other ‘good to know’ literature on the subject (reports, papers). An ‘Info sheet’ can be downloaded summarising knowledge on how to create a healthy and safe nightlife and highlighting the need for a mix of prevention, harm reduction and law enforcement measures (e.g. legislative measures, environmental strategies, stakeholder involvement and educational interventions). The first version of the Healthy Nightlife Toolbox, funded by the European Commission, was developed in the period 2008–10. With funding from the Dutch government under its Presidency of the EU in 2016, the toolbox  was updated by the Trimbos Institute (the Dutch Reitox national focal point), in cooperation with Liverpool John Moores University (UK) and the EMCDDA. The new version has been redesigned to make information easier to find and to be mobile-friendly. Tackling drug use in recreational settings is addressed in the EU Drugs Strategy 2013–20. The HNT expands on the model for partygoers in the EMCDDA Best practice portal, which demonstrates what works in the areas of drug prevention, treatment, harm reduction and social reintegration.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/fs1/2017/emcdda-hosts-healthy-nightlife-toolbox_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0249	2017-01-06	UNK	Correction to media articles 	 The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) would like to clarify that, while its activities include reporting on online drug markets, it is not recruiting hackers or rehabilitated traffickers to tackle drug trafficking on the internet, as stated in the various media articles this week. The last decade has seen the emergence of new internet technologies that have acted as important facilitators of online drug markets. The internet now hosts a range of virtual marketplaces (both on the surface and deep web) for selling and buying illicit substances, as well as representing a new arena for health and law-enforcement interventions. The agency draws on a variety of perspectives, including academia, journalism and frontline practice, to gain an overview of this complex topic and fast-changing environment. With a view to shedding further light on this issue, the EMCDDA published its first investigation into the world of online drug markets in February 2016 (see below). This brought together state-of-the-art input from over 20 experts and contributed to the knowledge base on this part of the supply chain. In April 2016, the internet was also covered in the EMCDDA-Europol EU Drug Markets Report. Among the themes explored in the report was the accelerated rate of change in the drug market due to globalisation and technology (criminal groups are quick to exploit opportunities provided by easier access to information, the internet and the growth in international trade). The EMCDDA reiterates that, while it explores a number of sources and perspectives, it is not recruiting, and has never recruited, hackers or rehabilitated traffickers to tackle drug trafficking on the internet. Methodology (EMCDDA Insights 21 — The internet and drug markets) This publication was based on a mixed-method Trendspotter study on internet drug markets, aiming to map out the territory and better understand the potential impact of the phenomenon. The objectives of the study were to increase understanding of the online supply of drugs with a focus on the sale of new psychoactive substances, research chemicals and ‘legal highs’; the use of social media and apps; online sales of medicinal products for illicit use; and the sale of drugs on the deep web. Analysis was based on triangulation of the available data, with a view to providing as complete and verified a picture as possible. The study methodology incorporated a number of investigative approaches and used data from multiple sources, with the work culminating in a Trendspotter meeting attended by international experts. These experts shared their experiences and contributed to an analysis of the topic, providing insights from IT, research and monitoring, law enforcement and drug-user perspectives. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2017/correction-media-article_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0250	2017-01-06	UNK	EMCDDA chairs JHA agencies’ network and focuses on the theme of the internet 	 This week, the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) embarks on a year-long presidency of a network of nine EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies (‘JHA network’), which play key advisory, operational and coordination roles in implementing EU priorities in the areas of freedom, security and justice (1). Taking over from the Vienna‑based Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), the EMCDDA will act as chair of the network until 31 December 2017, before handing over to the Vilnius‑based European Institute for Gender Equality in 2018 (2). The agencies work together on a wide range of issues, including human trafficking, migration and border management, drug trafficking and combating organised crime. The network was established in 2006 to boost cooperation in the migration and security fields and to develop synergies in areas of common interest (e.g. operational work, training, external relations). In 2017, the agencies will continue to provide technical support and deliver cross-agency evidence-based input to the policy- and decision-making processes at EU level. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel said: ‘Current migration and security situations in Europe call for ever closer cooperation between the EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies. Through this small network, the nine agencies assess how to improve their collaboration in areas such as information exchange, strategic analysis or work on the ground in migration “hotspots”, in order to respond in a timely and efficient way to a dynamic and changing situation in the areas of migration and internal security. Strong cooperation within this cluster of agencies over the last decade has shown what can be achieved when agencies build solid working relationships and exchange ideas on issues of common interest’. Focus on the internet The theme chosen by the network for 2017 will be the internet. From 20–21 April, a group of experts will address: ‘The expanding influence of the internet, the exploitation of cyberspace and the transformational nature of new technologies — challenges and opportunities for the work of the JHA agencies’. Discussions will focus on: monitoring open source information; drug supply on the darknet; and online secure communication. Key meetings, outcomes and reporting Three regular network meetings will take place at the EMCDDA in the course of the year, culminating in a   fourth and final meeting in November bringing together the Directors of the nine agencies to assess results (see ‘Calendar of meetings’). Additional expert meetings in 2017 will be organised to: provide fora for discussion; trigger relevant cooperation between the agencies; and help coordinate joint actions in strategic areas. Among the themes being addressed by the agencies are the: coordination of capacity- building activities in the EU Member States and non-EU countries; enhanced and joined-up support in migration ‘hotspots’ in Greece and Italy; operationalisation of EU classified information (EUCI); and the exchange of non-classified sensitive information at EU level. Since 2009, the JHA agencies have been required to report jointly to the Council’s Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security (COSI) (3) on the progress and the achievements on bilateral as well as multilateral cooperation in the network. A formal report, to be endorsed by the Heads of the JHA agencies in November in Lisbon, will be presented to COSI by the end of the year.

EMCDDA_UNK_0251	2016-12-15	UNK	Canada Task Force publishes recommendations for legalisation 	 In Canada, on 13 December 2016 the government-appointed Task Force on Cannabis Legalization and Regulation published its final report, which had been delivered to the ministers of justice, health and public safety on 30 November. The Task Force was appointed on 30 June 2016 to prepare the ground for fulfilment of Prime Minister Trudeau’s 2015 election promise to legalise, regulate and restrict access to cannabis. It comprised nine members and was headed by Anne McLellan, a lawyer who has held several key ministerial posts. It was guided by a government discussion paper which set out nine public policy objectives, including protecting young people and keeping money from organised crime. The Task Force established its own guiding principles: protection of public health and safety, compassion, fairness, collaboration, a commitment to evidence-informed policy, and flexibility. The 112-page report is based on five months of consultation (nearly 30 000 online submissions and over 300 written submissions). The recommendations aim for a public health approach while minimising unintended consequences. The Task Force prefers the scientific term cannabis to marijuana. The government is not obliged to accept any recommendations of the Task Force’s report. In Canada, an estimated 24 % of Canadians aged 15 to 24 years of age have used cannabis in the last year (only three out of 28 EU Member States have a similar or higher prevalence of use among the same age-group, and the EU average is 16 %). Personal possession of cannabis (up to 30 grams) is a criminal offence punishable by up to 6 months imprisonment. The legal system is federal, although provinces and territories may have their own variations of some laws, for example the age limit to purchase alcohol may be 18 or 19. Medical cannabis has been available since 1999. Over time the regulations have evolved from initially providing individual exemptions to enable patients to possess cannabis for their personal consumption for medical reasons, to a system of federal licensing that allows patients, with the support of their physicians, to obtain cannabis from one of 36 licensed producers, to cultivate their own cannabis or to designate someone to cultivate it on their behalf. It may be distributed by mail or courier. While not legal federally, some cannabis wellness clubs and ‘dispensary’ shops have existed for several years in some regions.

The project analysed wastewater in over 50 European cities in 18 European countries in March 2016 to explore the drug-taking behaviours of their inhabitants. From London to Nicosia and from Oslo to Lisbon, the study analysed daily wastewater samples in the catchment areas of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) over a one-week period.  Wastewater from approximately 25 million people was analysed for traces of four illicit drugs: amphetamine, cocaine, MDMA (ecstasy) and methamphetamine. Wastewater based epidemiology is a rapidly developing scientific discipline with the potential for monitoring near-real-time, population-level trends in illicit drug use (2). By sampling a known source of wastewater, such as a sewage influent to a wastewater treatment plant, scientists can now estimate the quantity of drugs used in a community by measuring the levels of illicit drugs and their metabolites excreted in urine (see motion graphic for method) (3). The SCORE group has been conducting annual wastewater monitoring campaigns since 2011. This is the first time, however, that data are published within only a few months of the campaign, underlining the potential of this method for the timely monitoring of trends in illicit drug use at population level. The results are released today through an innovative interactive map and chart-based tool allowing the user to look at geographical and temporal patterns and zoom in on results per city (4). The findings offer a valuable snapshot of the drug flow through the cities involved, revealing marked regional variations in drug use patterns: Methamphetamine use, generally low and traditionally concentrated in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, now appears to be present also in the east of Germany and northern Europe, particularly in cities in Finland. Traces of cocaine in wastewater indicate that cocaine use is highest in western and southern European cities, particularly in cities in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK. The analysis points to very low to negligible cocaine use in the majority of eastern European cities. For MDMA, the 2016 wastewater data confirmed the trend established in 2015. In most cities, wastewater MDMA loads were higher in 2016 than in 2011, with sharp increases seen in some cities, which may be related to the increased purity of MDMA or increased availability and use of the drug.  The loads of amphetamine detected in wastewater varied considerably across the study locations, with the highest levels reported in cities in the north of Europe. Amphetamine was found at much lower levels in cities in the south of Europe. When weekly patterns of drug use were examined, cocaine and MDMA (ecstasy) levels rose sharply at weekends in most cities, while methamphetamine use appeared to be more evenly distributed throughout the week. In this project, SCORE uses a standard protocol and a common quality-control exercise in all locations, making it possible to directly compare illicit drug loads in Europe over a one-week period over six consecutive years.  The EMCDDA adopts a multi-indicator approach to drug monitoring on the principle that no single measure can provide a full picture of the drug situation. It views wastewater analysis as a valuable additional tool in its epidemiological toolkit and one which can provide timely information on a wide spectrum of substances. Commenting today, EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel said: ‘Wastewater-based epidemiology has demonstrated its potential to become a useful complement to established drug monitoring tools. Its ability to deliver timely data on drug use patterns is particularly relevant against the backdrop of an ever-shifting drugs problem. By detecting changes in drug use patterns, both geographically and over time, it can help health and treatment services respond better to emerging trends and changing treatment needs. We are delighted that the SCORE group has been able to release data for the first time in the same year as the data-collection exercise’. In 2017, in the margins of the Lisbon Addictions 2017 conference, the EMCDDA will be co‑hosting ‘Testing the waters 2017’, the third international conference on wastewater analysis.

EMCDDA_UNK_0253	2016-12-12	UNK	EMCDDA meeting focuses on quality standards in drug demand reduction 	 Quality standards in drug demand reduction will be the focus of discussions today at an EMCDDA meeting gathering experts from seven countries. The purpose of the meeting is to present how the ' Council conclusions on the implementation of minimum quality standards in drug demand reduction in the EU’, adopted by the Council in September 2015, can relate to projects at national, European and international level. The Council conclusions list 16 standards that represent a minimum benchmark of quality for interventions in: drug use prevention, risk and harm reduction, treatment, social integration and rehabilitation. Although non-binding for national governments, the document represents the political will of EU countries to address demand reduction interventions through an evidence-based perspective. It invites the EMCDDA to: continue gathering evidence on effective interventions in drug demand reduction; support Member States in the implementation of these standards; and include information on EU minimum quality standards in its annual reporting. The guidelines were drawn up in the context of Action 9 of the EU action plan on drugs (2013–16) (‘Agree and commence the implementation of EU minimum quality standards, that help bridge the gap between science and practice’). The EMCDDA’s Best practice portal is expressly identified as an assessment mechanism in the plan. Under the objective to ‘Identify, promote and monitor best practice’, the EMCDDA’s Strategy and work programme 2016–18 requires the agency to monitor the implementation of these standards. During the meeting, representatives from Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Latvia, Slovenia, Slovakia and the UK will present their perspectives on developing such standards and discuss the commonalities and differences in national experiences. Lessons learnt in quality standards in prevention and treatment will also be presented. A representative of the European Commission, responsible for drug demand reduction, will intervene in the discussions and offer insight into what will be carried out in the future on Minimum Quality Standards at EU level. A representative from the Civil Society Forum on Drugs will speak on international collaborations in quality standards. The meeting will discuss how minimum quality standards can be used to improve the quality of interventions. It will give rise to an EMCDDA rapid communication on the state of development of quality standards in Europe. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/meeting-quality-standards-demand-reduction_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0254	2016-12-09	UNK	Council adopts its position on the reform of the new psychoactive substances legislation	" On 8 December, the Council adopted its position on a package reforming the legislation on new psychoactive substances (NPS) as well as improving the information exchange, early warning system and risk assessment procedure at EU level. The Council is now ready to start negotiations with the Parliament to agree on the reform. The package will allow for a more effective and efficient EU response to the new psychoactive substances, which appear on the EU market at unprecedented pace, posing a risk to public health and safety. In particular, it will streamline the procedure followed at EU level to assess the potential negative effects of a new psychoactive substance and decide on a possible ban. Moreover, the package foresees a reduction from 12 to 6 months of the time given to member states to implement the decision on banning of new psychoactive substances. Lucia Žitňanská, minister for Justice of Slovakia said: ""With this new package, if agreed with the Parliament, we would be able to cut by almost half the time needed to assess and possibly decide on the European ban of new psychoactive substances should they represent a severe danger for public health"". The package is composed of an amendment to the founding regulation of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) regarding information exchange, early warning system and risk assessment procedure on psychoactive substances and a directive amending the Council framework decision from 2004 on the minimum provision on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking.

EMCDDA_UNK_0255	2016-11-26	UNK	Four more US states legalise cannabis sale	" In the United States, a system of ‘ballot initiatives’ allows citizens to directly propose and vote on draft laws in about 24 of the 50 states. Proposals for legal systems of cannabis cultivation and sale, for recreational use, had been rejected in California (2010), Oregon (2012) and Ohio (2015), and passed in Colorado and Washington State (2012), Alaska and Oregon (2014). The accepted systems are private commercial models of supply, and all built in some way on pre-existing commercial models of cultivation and sale of cannabis for medical use. Under these systems, although personal use was legalised quickly, it has usually taken 1 to 2 years for licensed shops to appear, due to the need for detailed implementing regulations and issuing of cultivation and sales licences. A law allowing home grow and consumption, but no sale, was passed in Washington DC in 2014. While voting for the next US president on 8 November 2016, citizens also voted for commercial models of recreational cannabis supply in five states. Voters in Arizona rejected the proposal (Proposition 205) with 52 % against. For the other states, the results are as follows: State California Maine Massachusetts Nevada Text of law Proposition 64 Question 1 Question 4 Question 2 Votes in favour 56% 50.2 % (there may be a recount) 54% 54% Limit to personal possession 28.5 g 			4 g concentrate 71g 28.5 g 			5 g concentrate 28.5 g 			3.5 g concentrate Limit to home grow per person 6 plants 6 plants, 12 in one residence; with ID tags on each plant 6 plants, 12 in one residence 6 plants, 12 in one residence; not within 25 miles (40 km) of retail store Personal use permitted from 09.11.2016 Date dependent on governor approval after recount 15.12.2016 01.01.2017 These models of supply are similar to those in place in the four states that already permit recreational cannabis: they permit taxed commercial sale; they supplement pre-existing commercial medical cannabis systems; collective growing of ‘personal’ quotas, known in Europe as social clubs, is not permitted. But there are developments. First, in three of the states, the laws already establish a limit of personal possession of cannabis concentrates — resin or other products — while earlier laws as originally voted did not (some states have added it later). Secondly, they make provision for places to smoke or consume cannabis other than in private property. This is significant as otherwise tourists are not able to find a place to consume the drug, because of smoking bans in the shops and hotel rooms and a general ban on cannabis use in public. Indeed, this conundrum is thought to be a factor behind the increased demand for edible cannabis products such as sweets, chocolate and drinks. Of the four earlier states, only Alaska had provision for licensed consumption areas, but one year later no licenses have yet been issued.

Other aspects to be discussed include the: illicit production of drugs; strategies to fight the conditions fostering drug use; exploitation of young children in criminal organisations that distribute narcotics; and the effects of drug legalisation on our society. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/conference-vatican_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0257	2016-11-21	UNK	Thirty-eight countries attend 2016 Reitox week in Lisbon	 Representatives of candidate, potential candidate and neighbouring countries of the EU are joining members of the EMCDDA’s Reitox network in Lisbon today for the kick-off of the agency’s fifth Reitox week (1). The purpose of this annual event is to broaden the scope of regular Reitox meetings, underline the importance of the EU drug monitoring model and add impetus to the agency’s technical cooperation with countries outside the EU (2). Reitox — the European information network on drugs and drug addiction — was set up in 1993 and is composed of 30 national monitoring centres or national focal points (NFPs) in the 28 EU Member States, Turkey and Norway, as well as a focal point at the European Commission. The NFPs — from which the agency draws the bulk of its data — collect and analyse national information on drugs, drawing on various sectors including health, justice and law enforcement. The 2016 Reitox week (21–25 November) unites 38 nations including: the current 30 members of the network and a number of beneficiary countries of the European Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) and the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP)(3). The Reitox week encompasses three events: international cooperation project-related meetings; a Reitox ‘extended network’ meeting (4) — this year focusing on ‘Drugs and recreational settings’ — and the regular Heads of focal point meeting. During the extended meeting, experts and researchers from 10 countries (Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Croatia, Hungary, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia and Serbia) will share available data on substance use in open-air music festivals and other recreational and nightlife settings. In particular, they will look at the experiences and challenges faced by festival organisers and at existing interventions targeting the consequences of substance use in this context.  A special focus will be placed on prevention strategies and on the evaluation of their effectiveness. Alexis Goosdeel, EMCDDA Director, says: ‘With this meeting, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the dimension of problems associated with substance use in specific recreational settings, such as open-air music festivals and nightlife venues. Our discussions this week will help us shed light on the potential, yet often underused, role of local regulators, party organisers and parents' organisations in reducing substance-use-related problems in these settings. They will also help EU and partner countries identify possible steps towards implementing evidence-based interventions to tackle this issue'. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/fs10/reitox-week-2016_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0260	2016-10-17	UNK	Registration opens for sixth European drugs summer school	 The University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL) and the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) will be joining forces next summer to hold the sixth European drugs summer school (EDSS) on ‘Illicit drugs in Europe: demand, supply and public policies’ (1). Registration opens today for the two-week course, which will take place in the Portuguese capital from 26 June to 7 July (2). The initiative is also supported by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Through a multidisciplinary and interactive approach to the drugs problem, EMCDDA scientific experts, leading academics, guest speakers and policymakers, will prepare participants to meet the complex policy challenges in this field — both in Europe and beyond. The focus of the 2017 course will be on preventing and reducing mortality. Week 1 of the summer school, focusing on the ‘Drugs problem: market, substances, use and harms’, will feature lectures on: the global burden of drug-related problems; drug markets in Europe; detecting new drugs; and demand-reduction interventions. This session will also focus on the EMCDDA’s epidemiological indicators and their use in informing drug policy. Week 2, dedicated to ‘Policymaking for drug-related issues’, will include lectures on: drug policies (concepts, issues and analysis); the EU drug strategy; drug laws and public expenditure; and monitoring supply reduction and drug enforcement activity. It will close with an analysis of the link between evidence and decision-making. Study visits to outreach facilities and to one of the Portuguese commissions for dissuasion will be organised over the two weeks. During the course, students will also participate in interactive workshops to discuss their own projects and views. The course will conclude with an open debate with guest speakers. The target audiences for the EDSS are: university students, researchers, professionals and administrators interested in working on drug issues. The previous rounds of the summer school brought together students from the EU Member States as well as from Africa, Asia, Australia and the Americas. Profiles of former alumni and their testimonials can be found on the official summer school website and their statements viewed in a promotional video. In 2017, students will again be able to apply for scholarships and ‘early-bird’ reductions are available (3). The EDSS is run in English. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/fs9/registration-opens-for-2017-european-drugs-summer-school_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0261	2016-10-14	UNK	European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety to visit EMCDDA	 Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, will visit the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) this afternoon for an update on the agency’s work in the area of public health. The Commissioner is in Lisbon for the final conference of the Joint Action on Reducing Alcohol Related Harm (RARHA) project, where he will speak at the closing session along with Adalberto Campos Fernandes, Portuguese Minister of Health and João Goulão, Portuguese National Drug Coordinator. The RARHA project, launched at the EMCDDA in January 2014, is a three-year initiative, funded by the European Union under the second EU Health Programme. Led by the Portuguese General-Directorate for Intervention and Addictive Behaviours and Dependencies (SICAD), it was conceived to mobilise countries to develop common approaches in line with the EU alcohol strategy. The EMCDDA is among RARHA’s collaborating partners and also a member of its Advisory Board. During the visit to the EMCDDA, the Commissioner will discuss, with the Director and staff, the issue of polydrug use in Europe, including the findings from the latest report from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD). He will also be presented with the agency’s latest work in the area of drug-related infectious diseases, in particular hepatitis C. Monitoring the harms related to new drugs in Europe, via the EU Early Warning System (EWS) on new psychoactive substances (NPS), will also be covered. These harms vary in nature and can be serious, including acute poisonings and deaths. In 2014 and 2015, the EMCDDA issued 33 public health-related alerts to the Member States regarding the use of NPS. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/fs8/visit-commissioner-health-food-safety_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0262	2016-10-12	UNK	EMCDDA Director pays official visit to Europol	 EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel is paying an official visit to Europol today where he will discuss with Director Rob Wainwright opportunities for further cooperation between the two agencies. The agencies signed their first ‘Cooperation agreement’ in 2001, building on already strong links forged in the area of new synthetic drugs from 1997. Since then, the two bodies have strengthened their commitment through a series of agreements and collaborative activities in order to produce state-of-the-art analyses of the European drug market and its impact (see links opposite). Speaking in The Hague, Alexis Goosdeel said: ‘For the past 15 years, the EMCDDA and Europol have been working closely together, pooling expertise and insight to contribute to a safer and a more secure Europe. By combining a holistic overview of the drug situation with strategic intelligence on trends in organised crime, we have delivered crucial analyses, such as the EU Drug Markets Report, informing policy and facilitating action at EU and national level. We collaborate on a daily basis, monitoring potentially threatening new psychoactive substances, in doing so helping to reduce harm and save lives. We will continue to work together in the area of security, producing threat assessments and using data-collection tools that help us separate important signals from the ever-present noise’. Commenting on the challenges for law enforcement posed by drug-related crime, Europol Director Rob Wainwright said: ‘The cooperation between Europol and the EMCDDA has proved to be exemplary, in particular in combatting illicit drug markets in the EU. Illicit drugs are one of the major threats to the health and security of EU citizens, with up to two million problem drug users. This strong collaboration demonstrates what Justice and Home Affairs agencies can achieve together when trusted relationships are established.’ The EMCDDA will be chairing the EU Justice and Home Affairs agencies’ network in 2017 and will focus on internet-related topics such as drug supply on the darknet.

EMCDDA_UNK_0263	2016-10-07	UNK	Contingency management can help retain people in treatment and strengthen abstinence	 Ahead of World Mental Health Day on 10 October, the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) has published a new review on how contingency management can help treat those with substance use disorders (1). Contingency management (CM) is a technique used across a range of mental health and related conditions which involves rewarding patients when they fulfill certain target behaviours. In the area of drug dependence, this motivational method forms part of a range of psychosocial interventions designed to retain people in treatment, weaken substance use and strengthen abstinence (2). While much of the scientific literature to date has focused on CM in relation to the use of specific substances, and its effects when combined with other psychosocial interventions, today’s report focuses on CM delivered alongside opioid substitution treatment (OST) or detoxification. In particular, the paper explores the effectiveness of this method in increasing adherence to pharmacological treatment programmes and in targeting certain behaviours in drug-dependent patients (namely opioid, cocaine and methamphetamine users). It also looks at how CM affects patients’ participation in screening programmes (for HIV and hepatitis B and C) and vaccination programmes (hepatitis B virus/HBV). The report offers a systematic review of 38 studies, 34 of which were conducted in the United States, three in China and one in Malaysia. Three economic studies were also examined. CM interventions are largely based on behavioural reinforcers and the monitoring of results. Behavioural reinforcers are benefits which may include cash, vouchers, prizes or other kinds of perceived privileges (e.g. take-home doses of methadone). The patient gains or loses these reinforcers according to whether or not he/she consistently achieves the expected behaviour. In the case of substance use disorders, CM is provided in detoxification clinics, psychosocial counselling services and methadone maintenance programmes. Overall, the study results show that CM can help retain people in treatment and promote a reduction in opioid and cocaine problems among patients in OST. Data on patients with other substance-related problems were less available for this analysis. Evidence on the cost-effectiveness of CM was not strong enough to recommend its systematic implementation, but still suggested that CM is a promising strategy overall, if the economic effects are considered in the long term. The report concludes that CM is a feasible and promising adjunct to treatment interventions for drug users. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/fs7/emcdda-publishes-paper-on-contingency-management_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0265	2016-09-20	UNK	New ESPAD results: teenage drinking and smoking down, but concerns posed by new drugs and new addictive behaviours	 Smoking and drinking among 15–16-year-old school students are showing signs of decline, but there are concerns over challenges posed by new drugs and new addictive behaviours. And while overall illicit drug use is stable in this group after previous increases (1995–2003), it continues at high levels. These are among the findings released today in the latest report from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD). The study, published in collaboration with the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), is based on a 2015 survey in 35 European countries, including 24 EU Member States (1). This is the sixth data-collection wave conducted by the ESPAD project since 1995 (every four years), the latest round coinciding with its 20th anniversary. A total of 96 043 students participated in the survey, responding in school to an anonymous questionnaire. The results, showing 20-year trends, will be presented at the EMCDDA today during the agency’s annual expert group meeting on general population surveys (2). The ESPAD Report 2015 features information on students’ experience of, and perceptions about, a variety of substances including: tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs, inhalants, pharmaceuticals and new psychoactive substances (NPS). Special attention is given in the new report to NPS, excessive internet use and online gaming and gambling, all of which were monitored for the first time in this survey round. The EMCDDA includes ESPAD data in its annual reporting on the drug situation and the two bodies work closely together to enhance understanding of long-term drug use trends among this population in Europe (3). Decline in teenage drinking and smoking, but heavy episodic drinking still a concern Positive developments are seen with regard to teenage smoking across the board (lifetime use, last-30-day use and daily use), against a backdrop of tobacco policy measures introduced over the last two decades (4).  In the 2015 survey, over half of the respondents (54% — range: 34% to 84%) reported that they had never smoked, while less than a quarter (21% — range: 6% to 37%) reported they were ‘current smokers’ (last 30 days). The proportion of students who started daily smoking at an early age (before 13) decreased over the 20 years: from 10% to 4%. Daily smoking, including early onset of this practice, continues to be more prevalent among boys, but the gender gap has narrowed over the 20 years as it has for smoking overall. Despite strict regulations on tobacco in most countries, over 60% of adolescents still reported relatively easy access to it. Alcohol use among adolescents in Europe remains high, but here also, time trends since 1995 show some positive developments. Lifetime use of alcohol decreased from 89% to 81% between 1995 and 2015 and last-30-day use from 56% to 47%, with a marked decrease seen in both patterns after a peak in 2003. The prevalence of ‘heavy episodic drinking’ has remained unchanged over the 20 years, with values in 2015 similar to those in 1995. However, after progressive increases from 1995, the prevalence values decreased clearly from 2011 to 2015 (for boys 44% to 37%; for girls 38% to 33%) in some countries. Less positively, every third student (35%) reported heavy episodic drinking in the past month in the latest survey. Over three-quarters of respondents (78%) reported relatively easy access to alcohol. Illicit drug use stable, but still at high levels    On average 18% of students reported having used an illicit drug at least once in their life, but levels varied considerably across the ESPAD countries (range: 6%–37%). Following a general upward trend between 1995 and 2003 in the prevalence of illicit drug use, this has remained largely stable since 2003. However, illicit drug use remains at high levels, with 10 countries reporting levels in excess of 25%. The most prevalent illicit drug in all ESPAD countries was cannabis. On average, 16% of the students reported using cannabis at least once in their lifetime (range: 4%–37%). On average, 7% of students had used cannabis in the last 30 days (range: 1%–17%). Between 1995 and 2015, trends in cannabis use indicated a general increase in both lifetime use (11% to 17%) and last-30-day use (4% to 7%). Prevalence peaked in 2003 (19%) and slightly decreased thereafter (17%). Around three in 10 students (30%) considered cannabis to be easily available. The perceived availability of other illicit drugs was relatively low: ecstasy (12%), cocaine (11%), amphetamine (9%), methamphetamine (7%) and crack (8%). Across the ESPAD countries, 4% of the students reported lifetime experience with new psychoactive substances (NPS) (range: 1%–10%), while 3% said they had used them in the past year (range: 1%–8%). On average, NPS seem to be more commonly used than amphetamines, ecstasy, cocaine or LSD, all of which have lower lifetime prevalence rates, underlining the need to closely monitor NPS. Internet use, gaming and gambling — close monitoring needed With the internet now an integral part of daily life, ‘the development of patterns of addictive use among children and adolescents needs to be closely monitored and investigated’, states the report. Questions on the amount and purpose of internet use were included in the latest questionnaire, with a focus on six activities: social media use; information seeking/surfing; streaming/downloading; online gaming; online money gambling and buying/selling. On average, students used the internet on 5.8 days per week. Girls used social media regularly more often than boys (four or more days in the last week) (83% versus 73%). Online gaming was more prevalent among boys (39% compared to 7%). In all countries, considerably more boys than girls reported gambling experience in all forms (23% versus 5% on average) or gambling frequently (12% versus 2%) in the last year. The ESPAD Group expresses concern over the popularity of online gaming and youth gambling: ‘Measures to prevent adolescents from developing problems associated with gambling, such as debts, psychological deficits and social disadvantages, are of high priority’. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel said: ‘For the past 20 years, ESPAD has been providing us with valuable insights into patterns and trends in adolescent substance use across Europe. Now this latest report has extended the scope of the survey to include not only new drugs but also new and potentially addictive behaviours that are raising public concern, such as excessive internet use, gaming and gambling. By monitoring these new developments, ESPAD is increasing its contribution to protecting adolescents from the negative consequences of substance use and of addictive behaviours in general’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/10/espad-report_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0266	2016-09-13	UNK	Upcoming ESPAD report on substance use among school students 	 The latest European data on substance use among 15–16-year-old school students will be released next week (20 September). The findings are based on a 2015 survey in 35 European countries conducted by the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD). ESPAD has been collecting data through school surveys every four years since 1995, the latest wave coinciding with its 20th anniversary. Special attention is given in the new report to new psychoactive substances, excessive internet use and online gaming and gambling, all of which were monitored for the first time in this survey round. Published in collaboration with the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), the report will be presented during the agency’s annual expert group meeting on general population surveys (closed to the press). The EMCDDA includes ESPAD data in its annual reporting on the drug situation and the two bodies work closely together to enhance understanding of long-term drug use trends among this population in Europe. The report (in English) and the full dataset underpinning the analysis will be available online at www.espad.org 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/espad-upcoming-report_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0268	2016-08-31	UNK	New psychoactive substances: Commission proposes new ban and strengthens the EU's Early Warning System and risk assessment	" Today, the European Commission has proposed to subject the new psychoactive substance MDMB-CHMICA (sometimes referred to as ‘Black Mamba’) to control measures across the European Union.  According to the risk assessment report provided by EMCDDA, the acute toxicity of MDMB-CHMICA can cause severe harm to the health of individuals. So far, eight Member States have reported 28 deaths and 25 acute intoxications associated with MDMB-CHMICA. Multiple reports have also indicated the possibility that its use causes violence and aggression. On the basis of the risk assessment report and following the proposal from the European Commission, the Council, having consulted the European Parliament, may decide to subject the drug to control measures throughout the EU. In such a case, EU Member States would then be required to introduce such controls in line with national laws no later than one year after the Council’s decision. This week, the Commission also proposed an amendment to the founding Regulation of the EMCDDA to allow for swifter and more effective EU action in the fight against new psychoactive substances. The proposal aims at further strengthening the EU Early Warning System and risk assessment on new psychoactive substances by streamlining and speeding up data collection and assessment procedures. It is part of the new approach agreed with the European Parliament and the Council to advance the negotiations on the package of legislative proposals on NPS proposed in September 2013.  Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Dimitris Avramopoulos said: ‘The number, type and availability of harmful new drugs continue to grow in Europe, and Member States cannot effectively fight the spread of these new psychoactive substances alone. Our proposal to subject MDMB-CHMICA or ""Black Mamba"" to control measures is part of our efforts to effectively address the threat posed by new psychoactive substances on a European level. The same is true for our proposal to strengthen the EU's early warning system and risk assessment - it will allow for a more systematic and sophisticated monitoring and swifter decision-making on new psychoactive substances.’ European Commission press release http://europa.eu/rapid/midday-express-31-08-2016.htm For further information, please contact: Natasha Bertaud – Tel.

EMCDDA_UNK_0269	2016-08-04	UNK	New EMCDDA report sheds light on drug-related hospital emergencies	 Data from hospital emergency departments show that every year in Europe thousands of individuals experience drug-related poisoning and other harms, requiring some kind of medical assistance. In a new report published today, the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) provides the latest findings on hospital emergency cases resulting from drug use. It reveals that those affected are mainly young adults (20–39 years) and predominantly male and that heroin is still No 1 on the Top 20 list of drugs involved. It also signals a recent rise in cases linked to new psychoactive substances (NPS)(1).   The report is based on an analysis by the European Drug Emergencies Network (Euro-DEN Plus), which monitors drug-related emergency presentations in 20 ‘sentinel’ hospitals in 14 European countries (2). The report reveals that, in its first two-year data-collection period (October 2013 to September 2015), the network recorded 10 956 drug-related emergency presentations, including 49 deaths.   Over two-thirds (70.2%) of the presentations were recorded in five of the centres — situated in Dublin, London (2 centres), Oslo and Paris — over half of them (61%) occurring in Oslo and London.  A similar number of presentations were reported in Year 1 (5 529) and Year 2 (5 427). Males dominated the presentations in all age groups (76%). The EMCDDA adopts a multi-indicator approach to drug monitoring on the principle that no single measure can provide a full picture of the drug situation. It views hospital emergency data-collection as a useful addition to its monitoring toolkit. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘Data from hospital emergency units can provide us with a unique insight into acute health harms related to drug use and can enrich our understanding of the drugs problem by broadening the scope of our monitoring. Emergency data can complement routine indicators of high-risk drug trends and related harms but also act as early-warning signals on new substances and patterns of use. Continued monitoring in these settings will help us assess the public health impact of acute drug toxicity in Europe, develop appropriate healthcare and prevention activities and provide crucial input to our risk assessments of new psychoactive substances’. Most of the presentations recorded in the study reportedly involved one drug (62%) or two (26%). Two-thirds of the substances recorded (64%) involved established illicit drugs (e.g. heroin, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamine and MDMA) and one quarter (25%) over-the-counter or prescription medicines (e.g. benzodiazepines). Top 20 drugs involved in hospital emergencies The report presents the Top 20 most commonly reported drugs in the sentinel hospital emergencies over the two years (see Figure 7). Of these, 19 appeared in both years. Methedrone dropped from position 19 in Year 1 to 23 in Year 2, while the sedative zopiclone rose from 21 to 15. Over the two years, heroin was involved in nearly a quarter of presentations (24%), cocaine and cannabis both in 16%. Less commonly reported were new psychoactive substances (NPS) — often sold as ‘legal highs’ or research chemicals — representing 7% of drugs involved in hospital emergencies over the study period. But the report shows a rise in the proportion of NPS: from 6% of reported drugs in Year 1 to 8% in Year 2 (3). There was a significant geographic variation in NPS presentations, with a greater proportion reported in centres in Germany, Ireland, Poland and the UK. The most common clinical features reported were agitation/aggression (26%). Other severe features included chest pains (7%) psychosis (6%), seizures (3%), hyperthermia (1.4%) and cardiorespiratory arrest (0.5%). Of the 49 deaths recorded, 84% were in males (median age: 29 years). The deaths involved mainly opioids (23 deaths) and or stimulants (15 deaths). NPS were involved in 9 deaths. More cases in the summer months, at weekends and late at night A number of time patterns emerge from the data, including clear seasonal variations. Over the two years, fewer than 800 presentations were recorded for the months of December, January and February, compared to over 1 000 per month for the months of June, July and August. More cases were recorded at the weekend than on weekdays, with 18% occurring on Saturdays compared with 12–13% during the week. Cases were most common in the evening and early hours of the morning rather than during core working time.  Almost half (45%) of the cases were discharged from hospital within four hours. A minority were admitted to hospital, with 5.7% requiring admission to a critical area and 4.2% to a psychiatric ward. Cases of acute drug toxicity can constitute a significant burden and challenge to health services. The report states: ‘Overall, 68% of presentations arrived at the emergency department by ambulance, indicating significant utilisation of pre-hospital emergency services’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/9/report-on-drug-related-hospital-emergencies_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0270	2016-07-28	UNK	New EMCDDA report shows grounds for hope in treating hepatitis C	 Hepatitis C is an infectious disease of the liver caused by the blood-borne hepatitis C virus (HCV). Around 115 million people worldwide have been infected at some point in their life by HCV. Two-thirds of these are estimated to be chronically infected, over 5 million within the European Union. The infection is highly prevalent among people who inject drugs who can contract HCV through the sharing of needles, syringes and other injecting equipment. In a new report published today on World Hepatitis Day, the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) looks at new opportunities for the effective prevention and treatment of the disease, including the use of new generations of medicines (1). The new report — Hepatitis C among drug users in Europe: epidemiology, treatment and prevention — provides a state-of-the-art review of the epidemiology of HCV infection in Europe (2) and its estimated prevalence among people who inject drugs (3). HCV infection levels in this group range from 15% to 84%, with many studies showing 50% or more infected. There is also strong evidence of ongoing and, in some countries, high levels of transmission among young injectors, suggesting that infection can be acquired early in an individual’s injecting career. According to the report: ‘HCV prevention remains one of the major challenges for Europe’s public health responses to drug injecting’. Initial infection with HCV is often asymptomatic and many people with an injection history are unaware that they are carrying the virus, leading to the disease being referred to as a ‘hidden epidemic’. If left unresolved, the infection can lead to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, cancer and death. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘Failure to address HCV infection among people who inject drugs will mean considerable costs in the future, both to individuals and to health budgets. Our new report shows, however, that there are now grounds for greater optimism in preventing and treating the disease. This is thanks to the combination of opioid substitution treatment and needle- and syringe-exchange programmes with new pharmacological options for HCV and a growing confidence in how to deliver treatment to people who inject drugs in the community. I believe that we now have an opportunity in Europe to make real and sustained progress in this area. By combining treatment with adequate prevention and harm-reduction measures, we have the necessary tools to control this epidemic’. New medications help lower barriers to treatment Traditional treatment for HCV included the use of the drugs interferon and ribavirin. While these could be effective, they were often poorly tolerated, brought severe side effects and involved a lengthy treatment period (24–48 weeks). These factors often contributed to poor treatment uptake by drug users. ‘This situation is now changing however’, states the report, which provides an up-to-date overview of the new medicines currently available or in development. Following the appearance on the market of new antiviral drugs, it describes how these can be administered over a shorter period and with fewer side effects, improving chances of treatment retention.  ‘The provision of HCV treatment has become less challenging’, states the report. The use of all-oral, interferon-free HCV treatment regimens makes them easier to administer, including in drug treatment and primary care settings. The report adds: ‘These developments now mean that, probably for the first time, a real opportunity exists to tackle the high prevalence of HCV infection at the level of injecting drug-user communities’. Preventing further infections and improving screening Health promotion activities encouraging people not to inject drugs, or to change risky injecting behaviour (e.g. needle-exchange programmes, opioid substitution treatment), remain key elements in current HCV prevention approaches. ‘However, coverage of both measures remains suboptimal in many countries and, therefore, requires strengthening’, states the report, which goes on to underline the need to extend services to the most disadvantaged and vulnerable but also to provide people who inject drugs with specific HCV diagnosis and care. The report underlines the important role that treatment can play in preventing the spread of the virus: ‘Treatment as prevention now emerges as a real possibility in providing an effective response to the HCV epidemic among drug injectors in Europe’, it says. The fact that many of those infected with HCV are unaware of their infection has consequences both for the continued transmission of the virus and for the long-term health of the individual concerned. This underlines the importance of raising public and professional awareness around the need for testing. Offering testing to all drug users in treatment is regarded as good practice. This is supported by the recently agreed EU minimum quality standards for demand reduction (Council of the European Union, 2015), which recommend that ‘treatment services provide voluntary testing for blood-borne infectious diseases, counselling against risky behaviours and assistance to manage illness’ (4). Scaling up treatment and supporting policies to eliminate hepatitis Studies suggest that the combination of widespread hepatitis C treatment, supported by other primary prevention measures, has the potential to reduce HCV transmission. The report emphasises that experimental evidence is now needed to test model projections and show how scaling up HCV treatment with other interventions can reduce HCV transmission in the population. Scaling up treatment offer will also require the development of effective partnerships between specialist services working with drug users and those offering HCV treatment and care. According to the report: ‘The challenge is to develop a comprehensive approach to care in this area that ensures that both prevention activities and treatment access are adequately resourced and proactively delivered’. The World Health Organization has declared as one of its global strategic objectives the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 (WHO, 2016)(5). The EMCDDA is committed to working with its international, European and national partners in this area to improve the evidence base and support the measures necessary to ensure that the ambitious public health goals established for the elimination of HCV infection are realised.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/8/hepatitis-c-among-drug-users-in-europe_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0273	2016-06-29	UNK	EMCDDA conference takes stock of project with ENP partner countries	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) is hosting a conference in Lisbon today marking the end of a 30-month technical cooperation project within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP)(1). The conference is being held in association with the European Commission’s Directorates-General for Migration and Home Affairs (DG-HOME) and for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations (DG-NEAR). The European Union-funded project — ‘Towards a gradual improvement of ENP partner countries' capacity to monitor and to meet drug-related challenges’ — was conceived to boost the capacity of ENP partner countries to react to fresh challenges posed by the drug phenomenon. Kicking off in January 2014, it provided scientific support for collecting and analysing information on drugs and for producing ad hoc products corresponding to national, EU and EMCDDA needs. Cooperation under the project included the exchange of know-how on national drug information systems and monitoring centres and the sharing of information on national strategies and best practice in demand reduction. An important component of the initiative was the exchange of information, working practices and methodology with project partner countries on the identification of new psychoactive substances. Key outputs of the project included: the production of new information on the drug situation in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. This featured data on the prevalence of drug use among young people (ESPAD surveys); data on seizures and improved knowledge regarding data-collection systems on drug supply.  Monitoring was strengthened via a series of national training activities on: drug prevention (Morocco); public expenditure (Israel); and NPS (Armenia). A national drug information system was also created in Lebanon. Today’s conference will look at the project objectives, outputs, lessons learned and the way forward. The meeting will also include a visit to a drug treatment centre and a forensic laboratory of the Portuguese judicial police, organised in cooperation with the Portuguese Reitox focal point (SICAD). The project began with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Israel, Moldova, Morocco and Ukraine. Other countries from the Eastern and Southern Partnership — Algeria, Belarus, Egypt, Lebanon and Tunisia —also contributed to some of the project activities. The ENP aims to forge closer ties with countries to the South and East of the European Union. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/fs5/enp-partner-conference_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0274	2016-06-27	UNK	Fifth European drugs summer school opens today in Lisbon	 The fifth European drugs summer school (EDSS) — ‘Illicit drugs in Europe: demand, supply and public policies’ — opened today in Lisbon and will run until 8 July (1). The initiative, organised by the University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE) and the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), is supported by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Opening the event were EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel and ISCTE coordinator of the EDSS Catherine Moury. This year, the focus of the course is on the evidence base for policymaking on drug-related issues. Keynote speakers will be considering the outcomes of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Drugs (UNGASS), which took place in New York in April 2016. Speakers on the first day feature Werner Sipp, President of the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), who will talk on ‘The global drug control system: what is the UNGASS process and what to expect from it?’. On subsequent days, speakers will include: Keith Humphreys (Stanford School of Medicine, USA); Robert West (Editor-in-Chief of the journal Addiction); Owen Bowden-Jones (Imperial College, London) and João Goulão (Portuguese National Drug Coordinator)(2). Week 1 of the summer school focuses on ‘Drug policies and the production of evidence’ and will feature lectures on: UNGASS 2016; evidence in harm reduction; drug markets in Europe; detecting new drugs; and prevention. This session will also focus on the EMCDDA’s epidemiological indicators and their use in informing drug policy. Week 2 is dedicated to ‘Policymaking for drug-related issues’, including lectures on: drug policies (concepts, issues, analysis); the position of the EU on drug policy in the international control system; drug laws and public expenditure; and monitoring supply reduction and drug enforcement activity. Week 2 will conclude with an analysis of the link between evidence and decision-making and will include study visits and an open debate on ‘Scientific communication and policy decisions’. The target audiences for the EDSS are: university students, researchers, professionals and administrators interested in working on drug issues. Through a multidisciplinary and interactive approach to the drugs problem, EMCDDA scientific experts, leading academics, guest speakers and policymakers will prepare participants to meet the complex policy challenges in this field — both in Europe and beyond.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/fs4/european-drugs-summer-school_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0275	2016-06-24	UNK	EMCDDA publishes its first report on health responses to new psychoactive substances	 Over the last decade, there has been an unprecedented rise in the number of new drugs appearing on the global market. In Europe, around two new psychoactive substances (NPS) are detected every week, posing a major challenge to drug policy and practice. In its latest report, released today ahead of International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking (26 June), the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) presents its first analysis of the health responses to these drugs, often sold as ‘legal highs’ (1). The report — Health responses to new psychoactive substances (2) — explains that, while NPS use in Europe remains relatively low (3), there are growing concerns over problematic forms of use and harms related to these drugs. It presents recent evidence of the association of NPS with hospital emergencies and rising demand for specialist drug treatment and describes how, in some countries, new stimulant substances are driving changes in drug injection patterns. The study reviews, for the first time, health- and drug-related responses to these drugs now emerging in Europe. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘The NPS market is complex and the rapid emergence of novel products means that developing supportive health interventions is challenging. Initial responses to new drugs in Europe have largely been regulatory, focusing on legislative tools to tackle supply. But as the phenomenon evolves, it is critical that we formulate and implement effective public health responses to the use of these substances. The significant number of annual detections of these drugs, and associated harms, calls for the continuous assessment and development of appropriate services for users at risk’. In 2015 alone, 98 new substances were detected for the first time via the EU Early Warning System on NPS, bringing the total number of new drugs monitored by the EMCDDA to 560. NPS: who’s at risk? The report identifies key groups considered to be at particular risk of NPS use and harms. These include, but are not limited to: young people; participants in nightlife events; men who have sex with men (MSM); individuals in custodial facilities; and people who inject drugs (PWID). A recent French survey revealed that 4 NPS users in 10 experience adverse effects following use, yet fewer than 4% of them seek support from a health professional (4). A study by the European Drug Emergencies Network (Euro-DEN) explored presentations to hospital emergency units involving NPS. Symptoms commonly recorded included: agitation, aggression, anxiety, palpitations and hallucinations (5). Today’s report explores intervention responses in specific settings where users may seek help. These include: school and family; nightlife venues; sexual health services; hospital emergency departments and clinical services; specialised drug treatment services; low-threshold services; and prisons and custodial facilities. It also looks at drug treatment, harm reduction and prevention activities delivered online. Several European countries report problematic forms of NPS use among PWID, such as high-frequency and compulsive injecting and needle sharing, increasing the possibility of HIV or hepatitis C (HCV) transmission. Injecting NPS (e.g. cathinones) with other drugs (e.g. methamphetamine) is also reported among MSM. These so-called ‘slamming’ practices are associated with high levels of sexual risk taking, pointing to the need for increased cooperation between drug treatment and sexual health services. Existing health responses can be adapted, but competence-building is still needed   The report concludes that existing interventions addressing drug use can be adapted to deliver a ‘comprehensive health response’ to NPS-related harms. The approaches recommended in the study are therefore largely based on existing responses (e.g. counselling, needle- and syringe-exchange programmes) but adapted to reflect: unique user group needs; the structural, cultural and social contexts of use and new opportunities for engaging recreational NPS user groups. It adds: ‘Professionals’ lack of experience with NPS and lack of knowledge of their pharmacology does not mean that they do not have the skills to support the users of these drugs. A professionally competent workforce is likely to already possess the skills required to support health responses to NPS use.’ But competence-building among health and drug professionals still represents a key investment priority in the field of health responses to NPS in Europe and even adapting existing interventions requires a basic understanding of the effects and harms associated with these novel substances. Here the report underlines the importance of updating professionals’ knowledge and skills on NPS via basic training materials and knowledge-exchange platforms for clinicians, healthcare and social workers. Among the health responses highlighted in the report are consumer-protection initiatives, such as drug checking and harm-reduction interventions, which provide opportunities to reduce and prevent severe health consequences. Clinical guidelines for professionals are also cited as important resources. The NEPTUNE project is one example of European guidance material on NPS (6). Finally, the report stresses the importance of evidence-based responses to drug use. It warns that adapting existing interventions to respond to NPS ‘must proceed with caution and within a robust evaluative framework’.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/7/nps-responses_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0276	2016-05-31	UNK	EMCDDA highlights new health risks as products and patterns of use change  	 Europe’s drug market remains resilient, says the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) today as it launches in Lisbon its European Drug Report 2016: Trends and Developments (1). In its annual review, the agency highlights: the health risks of high-potency products; the continued emergence of new substances; and changing patterns of drug use. It also expresses concern over rises in overdose deaths in some countries and the threats posed by internet drug markets. ‘This new analysis highlights the need for Europe’s drug policy agenda to embrace a broader and more complicated set of policy issues than in the past’, states the report. Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, says: ‘Europe faces a growing problem with drugs. New psychoactive substances, stimulants, heroin and other opioids continue to be in high demand and supply, with major impacts on public health. That is why the 2016 European Drug Report is an important addition to our evidence base on the drugs problem and a helpful tool for European policymakers to shape policies and actions to address it. With this knowledge in hand, we will continue to call on EU Member State authorities, third countries, internet companies and civil society to redouble cooperation in fighting this global challenge’. The return of MDMA: rising use and high-dose products Today’s report confirms the return of MDMA (often sold as ‘ecstasy’) as a stimulant drug of choice for young people in Europe, citing ‘indications that MDMA is becoming more popular, both with established stimulant consumers and with a new generation of young users’ (2). Around 2.1 million young adults (15–34 years) report having used MDMA in the last year (1.7 % of this age group). While, until recently, MDMA use had been in decline — following peak levels in the early to mid-2000s — latest survey data point to increased use in Europe (Figure 2.4). Nine out of 12 reporting countries presented higher estimates of use among young adults in new surveys than in the previous comparable survey. There are also signs that MDMA is no longer a niche or sub-cultural drug used in dance clubs, but is now being used by a wider range of young people in more mainstream nightlife settings, such as bars and parties.   Complementing survey data, a 2015 multi-city study found residues of MDMA in municipal wastewater to be higher in 2015 than in 2011, with sharp increases in some cities (Figure 2.5)(3). This may be related to higher purity of MDMA and/or increased availability and use of the drug. The MDMA revival is associated with ‘innovation in sourcing MDMA precursors, new production techniques and online supply’, explains the EMCDDA. It also reports signs of resurging production, after a decline in the last decade. Large-scale MDMA production facilities, for example, have been dismantled in Belgium (2013) and in the Netherlands (2014). The availability of products with a high MDMA content prompted the EMCDDA and Europol to issue public health alerts in 2014. Powders, crystals and tablets containing high doses of MDMA are now more commonly available, with tablets sometimes promoted through sophisticated and targeted marketing techniques. This is thought to be a deliberate strategy by producers to boost the reputation of MDMA, after a period in which poor-quality products and adulteration resulted in a decline in use. EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘The revival of MDMA brings with it the need to rethink existing prevention and harm-reduction responses to target and support a new population of users who may be using high-dose products, without fully understanding the risks involved. Intoxications and even deaths associated with this drug are highlighted in our new report. This is particularly worrying since MDMA is moving into more mainstream social settings and is increasingly available via online markets.’ The report highlights that ‘the potential for expansion of online drug supply appears considerable’, although most illicit drug transactions are still played out offline (4). Here the EMCDDA underlines that responding to this ‘growing dark cloud on the horizon’, represents a question of critical importance for the future European policy agenda. New drugs: new harms and health alerts Harms related to new drugs in Europe are monitored via the EU Early Warning System (EWS) on new psychoactive substances (NPS). These harms vary in nature but can be serious, including acute poisonings and even deaths. The EMCDDA has issued 34 public health alerts to the Member States relating to the use of NPS since 2014 alone. The number, type and availability of NPS on the European market continue to grow, with over 560 NPS now monitored by the agency (Figure 1.10). In 2015, 98 new substances were reported for the first time (101 in 2014). Once again, the list of new substances reported was dominated by synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic cathinones (24 and 26 reported respectively). Together, these two groups accounted for almost 80% of the 50 000 NPS seizures in 2014 and over 60% of the 4 tonnes seized (Figure 1.11; 1.12). Responding effectively and rapidly to the sale of NPS, some of which are found to be highly toxic, is a major challenge. ‘Young consumers may unwittingly be acting as human guinea pigs for substances for which the potential health risks are largely unknown’, states the report. Synthetic cannabinoids, sold as ‘legal’ replacements for cannabis, can be highly toxic, and mass poisonings have been reported (e.g. in Poland). In February 2016, the EMCDDA issued a warning concerning MDMB-CHMICA, a synthetic cannabinoid associated with 13 deaths and 23 non-fatal intoxications in Europe since 2014. Synthetic cathinones are sold as ‘legal’ replacements for stimulants, such as amphetamine, MDMA and cocaine. The synthetic cathinone alpha-PVP (5), a potent stimulant, has been linked to almost 200 acute intoxications and over 100 deaths since 2011. The report describes how NPS producers may now be targeting more chronic and problematic drug users. Here concerns are growing over the number of new synthetic opioids detected. (A total of 19 new synthetic opioids, including 11 fentanyls, have been detected since 2009). Many fentanyls are highly potent and may be sold as heroin to unsuspecting users, posing a risk of overdose. In 2015, 32 deaths in Europe were linked to the synthetic opioid acetylfentanyl, leading to an EMCDDA–Europol analysis (6). Rises in overdose deaths: spotlight on heroin and other opioids At least 6 800 overdose deaths, mainly related to heroin and other opioids, are estimated to have occurred in the EU in 2014, slightly up on the previous year’s figure (see Chapter 3 and Statistical Bulletin). Worrying rises in these deaths are reported in some countries, with long-established opioid problems (e.g. Ireland, Lithuania, Sweden, UK)(see graphic, Chapter 3 and Figure 3.12). The reasons behind these rises in fatal overdoses are unclear, but a number of factors may be involved, including: increased heroin availability, higher purity, ageing users and changing consumption patterns, including the use of synthetic opioids and medicines. Overdoses are most commonly reported among older opioid users (35–50), but increases in overdose deaths are also seen among the under-25s in some countries (e.g. Sweden), warranting closer scrutiny. A number of countries now provide the overdose-reversal drug naloxone to opioid users via community schemes (7). While heroin remains the most commonly used opioid, synthetic opioids are increasingly misused and there has been a rise in the number of countries reporting synthetic opioids as the primary drug used by those entering treatment (Figure 2.9). Synthetic opioids used in substitution treatment (e.g. methadone, buprenorphine) are also regularly found in toxicology reports and these substances are associated with a substantial share of drug-related deaths in some countries (e.g. Ireland, France, Finland, UK). Strategies to prevent the diversion of opioid substitution treatment medications come under the spotlight today in a new EMCDDA analysis (Perspective on Drugs/PODs)(8).  Today’s report is enriched by new city-level data from a selection of hospital emergency rooms across Europe (Figure 3.11). While heroin is the illicit drug most commonly reported in emergencies, cocaine, other stimulants and cannabis feature prominently in some areas. Further developing the monitoring of hospital emergency data will enhance understanding of drug use patterns, acute intoxications and emerging problems (9).   An estimated 1.2 million people received treatment for illicit drug use in the European Union in 2014 (1.5 million including Norway and Turkey). Some 644 000 opioid users received substitution treatment in the EU in 2014 (680 000 including Norway and Turkey). The co-occurrence of substance use and mental health disorders (comorbidity)(10) continues to challenge treatment providers and is explored today in a new EMCDDA analysis (see POD). Stimulant-related problems ‘becoming more visible’ Recent findings from wastewater analysis and seizure and survey data highlight regional differences in stimulant patterns of use across Europe (Figures 1.5, 2.2, 2.3, 2.6, 2.7). Cocaine use is higher in western and southern European countries — reflecting ports of entry and trafficking routes — while use of amphetamines (amphetamine and methamphetamine) is more prominent in northern and eastern Europe. The report describes how ‘stimulant-related problems are now becoming more visible’. In some countries, there are concerns over the rising number of new demands for treatment for problems relating to amphetamines, despite relatively stable levels of use (Figure 2.10). Overall, in the last decade, Europe has seen a 50% rise in the number of clients entering treatment for the first time, with amphetamines as their primary drug (see graphic, Chapter 2). This has largely been driven by increases relating to amphetamines in Germany, and, to a lesser extent, to methamphetamine in the Czech Republic.  Despite drug injecting having declined in Europe overall, stimulant injecting is now a concern. Nearly half (47%) of new clients entering treatment in 2014 with amphetamines as their primary drug reported injecting as their main route of administration. A number of countries also report the injection of methamphetamine and cathinones with other drugs (e.g. GHB) among small groups of men who have sex with men. These so-called ‘slamming’ practices are associated with high levels of sexual risk-taking behaviours, pointing to the need for increased cooperation and a joined-up response from drug treatment and sexual health services. The long-term decline in the number of new HIV diagnoses among people who inject drugs (PWID) in the EU continues. In 2014, newly reported HIV diagnoses among injectors totalled 1 236, the lowest number for over a decade. Nevertheless, in 2015, localised outbreaks of HIV were reported in some marginalised populations in Ireland, Luxembourg and the UK (Scotland). Changes in drug use patterns, particularly increased stimulant injecting, were contributing factors in a number of these outbreaks. ‘Identifying and responding to localised patterns of stimulant use and related harms needs to be given greater priority’, states the report. Hepatitis C is highly prevalent among PWID in Europe, with national samples in the period 2013–14 showing HCV antibody prevalence of between 15% and 84% (Figure 3.9). While new medicines for treating hepatitis C are increasingly available, providing access to diagnosis and treatment remains a key challenge for professionals working with PWID. Cocaine remains the most commonly used illicit stimulant drug in Europe, with around 2.4 million young adults (15–34 years) reporting to have used it in the last year. Cocaine was cited as the primary drug by 60 000 clients entering specialised drug treatment in 2014 and by 27 000 clients entering treatment for the first time. Cocaine trafficking to Europe is the subject of a new EMCDDA analysis released today  (see POD). Cannabis: concerns over rises in use, potency and demand for treatment   An estimated 16.6 million young Europeans (15–34 years) have used cannabis in the last 12 months. While levels of use differ between countries (Figure 2.1), overall in Europe they do not appear to be falling and there are signs of some rises. Eight of the 13 countries with recent survey estimates (since 2013), report increases in last-year cannabis use in this age group. The health and social costs of cannabis use are most pronounced among frequent or long-term users (around 1% of European adults are estimated to be daily or almost-daily cannabis users). Potency levels of herbal cannabis and resin are high by historical standards (see graphic, Chapter 1), which may increase the risks of use. Data on those entering treatment for cannabis problems can improve understanding of the nature and scale of high-risk use in Europe. The number of those entering treatment for the first time for cannabis problems increased from 45 000 in 2006 to 69 000 in 2014. This rise in demand for treatment has been linked to a number of factors, including changing levels of use and intensive use, availability of more harmful products, different referral practices and greater availability of treatment services. Cannabis is the most commonly seized drug in Europe, accounting for more than three-quarters of seizures (78%)(Figure 1.1). The number of seizures of herbal cannabis overtook that of cannabis resin in Europe in 2009, and the gap has continued to widen (Figure 1.3). The quantity of cannabis resin seized in the EU, however, is still much higher than that of herbal cannabis (574 tonnes versus 139 tonnes) and the most recent data show that the quantity of resin seized has risen. Changes in Europe’s cannabis resin market are examined today in a new analysis accompanying the report (see POD). __________ Chair of the EMCDDA Management Board Laura d’Arrigo concludes: ‘Just a few weeks after the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on drugs, this report demonstrates the longstanding commitment of the European Union to an evidence-based approach to drug policy. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the latest tendencies across the 28 EU Member States, Turkey and Norway. It reminds us that, while some of the problems of the past remain firmly with us, new threats continue to emerge, in particular the development of the synthetic drugs market. I am convinced that such a report is a way to share the knowledge on the drug situation in Europe and to build together new responses to these challenges’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/6/european-drug-report-2016-highlights_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0277	2016-05-02	UNK	Speech by Alexis Goosdeel at National Drugs Coordinators’ meeting, Dutch Presidency	 EMCDDA Director, Alexis Goosdeel, attended the EU National Drugs Coordinators' meeting on 'Drugs and Nightlife' in Amsterdam, where he presented his views on developing efficient interventions for recreational drug use. Speech transcript Dear Minister, Dear Chair, Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank the Minister and the Dutch Presidency for this second invitation following the invitation to make a presentation at the side-event on ‘Evidence-based drug policies’ that took place at the UNGASS 2016 in New York one week ago. What I want to do here today is to share with you a few reflections and a few ideas on the challenges and perspectives that we have in front of us as far as developing efficient demand reduction interventions are concerned. As this is an introduction to the meeting that is dedicated to ‘Drugs and Nightlife’, I will focus my presentation on recreational drug use. In that perspective, I would like to highlight five topics that I believe are going to be relevant, or to remain relevant, for policy-making on drugs in the coming years. Cannabis remains an important challenge, not only because it is the main drug used in the EU and by the larger number of citizens, but because of the changes that we are detecting on the market: the herbal cannabis produced in Europe seems to have exceeded the cannabis resin produced in Morocco, which in turn has stimulated the producers of hashish to select varieties of cannabis with stronger concentration of THC. We don’t know yet the potential impact on health for the users; this needs to be carefully monitored, and interventions will need to be adapted. MDMA is making a remarkable comeback on the European market, although in a different context and apparently for a new profile of consumers, with products being sold showing a much higher concentration of the active substance. Other synthetic drugs are being used in a new and more complex association with other substances in the context of what is called ‘chemsex’, and are raising new issues in terms of potential risks for health. The experimental and recreational use of new psychoactive substances (NPS) does not show any sign of slowing down, and in some countries, some categories or groups of substances such as cathinones are changing status on the market. Some of the interventions that are going to be presented during this meeting are addressing the need for developing new harm-reduction interventions. The development of internet and of virtual markets changes the dynamics of the selling and buying process, potentially opening up the market to a wider audience and to a broader group of substances. Indeed, drug markets operating on the internet appear to be primarily associated with the distribution of either non-controlled substances or substances for which legal controls differ between countries and jurisdictions (medicines, lifestyle products, new psychoactive substances, precursor chemicals). New cannabis policies in other parts of the world are putting some pressure on the whole UN conventions system, and although it is certainly premature to make any guess about possible future developments, it is important to carefully observe the possible side-effects on the European situation, both from the perspective of demand and supply reduction. As requested, I would like to summarise the lessons learned from the European experience, and as I did in New York I would propose 5 ‘I’s’: Information: A renewed monitoring model is operational that combines different tools and methods in what we call ‘contemporary approaches’ of the monitoring of the drugs situation. To remain policy relevant, the monitoring and the analysis of the drug phenomenon need to integrate information coming from different sources, like for instance what we have done for the analysis of the European drug market. Interventions are being increasingly supported by a corpus of scientific evidence, for instance on treatment, harm reduction and prevention. It is now important to disseminate and to make more systematic use of that knowledge for the design, implementation and evaluation of demand-reduction interventions. Implications for the future: Over the last 20 years, European and national policies have integrated, in one way or another, a harm reduction dimension that clearly contributed to reducing the negative impact of drug use on society. It would be useful to draw the lessons from that experience at macro level and to identify some general principles (not linked to a single substance such as heroin) that could help the EU and the Member States to address any forthcoming drug problem. Inclusion of a broader set of issues, to support our understanding of what makes an effective intervention: for example the re-emergence of MDMA in a different context than that of the early nineties, the appearance of ‘chemsex’, or the unclear relationship between drug trafficking and radicalisation. This suggests that there is a need for integration of approaches and interventions that up until now have remained specific and fragmented. Innovation and imagination: The drug phenomenon has become very versatile and reveals a very dynamic capacity to adapt to change in its geographic, human, institutional, technological, regulatory and legal environment. So too has our monitoring, that has expanded to include toxicology, forensic data, open source data, and that is developing new methods to produce, for example, an estimate of the size of the drug market in Europe. This capacity for innovation remains a sine qua non for the production of new scientific evidence and also for imagining what the future might look like. This is why the EMCDDA will launch next year a Foresight exercise on ‘Drugs in Europe in 2030’. More concretely, I announce with pleasure that I have signed the decision for integrating the Healthy Nightlife Toolbox into our website and that it will be running before the end of this year. Dear Minister, dear Chair, dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe that this meeting will give to the discussion a concrete and pragmatic dimension that is one of the main characteristics of the Dutch approach on drug policy and that will further support the reflection of the EU Member States and of EU Institutions in this important policy area. Thank you very much for your attention.         	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/speeches/2016/national-drug-coordinators-meeting_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0279	2016-04-18	UNK	EMCDDA to join EU delegation at UNGASS 2016 in New York	 The 2016 UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on drugs will convene at the UN headquarters in New York from 19–21 April. This meeting — the third UNGASS dedicated to the topic — represents a major opportunity for the international community to review and address the world drug problem. The EMCDDA will join the EU delegation at the event, which will be headed by Neven Mimica, European Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development. Via plenary statements, interactive roundtables and some 50 side events, delegates at UNAGSS 2016 will review progress made in implementing the ‘2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action on international cooperation towards an integrated and balanced strategy to counter the world drug problem’ (1). The meeting is expected to adopt an ‘outcome document’ entitled: ‘Our joint commitment to effectively addressing and countering the world drug problem’. This document places new emphasis on a number of themes, including: new trends and emerging and persistent challenges and threats (e.g. new psychoactive substances and use of the internet); availability of, and access to, controlled substances for medical purposes; and the treatment of drug use disorders (with a focus on prevention, treatment and care of HIV/AIDS). The paper includes operational recommendations in areas ranging from demand reduction to effective law enforcement and judicial cooperation. At UNGASS, the EU stands united in reaffirming its commitment to the UN international drug control conventions, which provide sufficient scope and flexibility to accommodate a wide range of approaches to drug policy in accordance with national and regional specificities. In its common position, adopted on 11 November 2015, the EU reiterates the need for countries to respect human rights when implementing the international conventions. In this context, it calls for the abolition of the death penalty for drug-related crimes and for proportional sentencing and alternative measures to conviction or punishment. Protecting the health and welfare of mankind is an integral part of the international response to the global drug problem. The EU calls for the rebalancing of drug policy towards health-oriented approaches. Speaking from New York on the eve of UNGASS, EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel says: ‘The UNGASS process provides us with a major opportunity to underscore the importance of evidence-based decision-making in the field of drugs. Across the globe, the provision of objective, reliable and comparable data is helping countries formulate comprehensive, balanced and science-based drug policies. The EMCDDA strongly supports this approach. I am proud of the role we are playing in sharing Europe’s experiences of best practice in this area which will inform the UNGASS deliberations this week’.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/fs3/ungass/emcdda-to-join-eu-delegation-at-ungass-2016-in-new-york_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0280	2016-04-18	UNK	Follow the EMCDDA delegation at UNGASS 2016	 The UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on drugs, taking place from 19–21 April 2016 in New York, is a major political moment and an opportunity for the international community to review and address the world drugs problem.  The last UNGASS took place in New York in 1998, marking the 10th anniversary of the 1988 UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. On that occasion, countries committed to reducing illicit supply and demand for drugs by 2008. Their 10-year commitment was renewed in a Political Declaration and Plan of Action in 2009.  In 2012, the UN General Assembly decided to convene UNGASS 2016 following a proposal from Mexico, Guatemala and Colombia. The aim would be to review the progress of the 2009 Declaration and assess ongoing achievements and challenges in countering the world drugs problem. The EMCDDA will be present at the event, participating in the EU delegation. Statement delivered by H.E. Mr. Neven Mimica, European Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development, at the Thirtieth Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGASS) on the world drug problem. Photos from the EMCDDA delegation.

More information on the event can be found on the UNGASS 2016 website. Read a transcript of the Director's speech on public-health based approaches given during the side event. What is the United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS)? The General Assembly (GA) is the main deliberative, policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations. Comprising all 193 UN members, it provides a unique forum for multilateral discussion on the full spectrum of international issues covered by the UN Charter. The Assembly meets from September to December each year. The United Nations Charter also provides an opportunity for the General Assembly to meet in so-called Special Sessions to consider issues of importance. These are convened by the Secretary-General at the request of the Security Council or of a majority of UN members.  Between 1947 and 2014, 29 Special Sessions were convened, two of which addressed drugs issues. The first of these (20–23 February 1990), focused on ‘Drug abuse’. The second (8–10 June 1998), marking the 10th anniversary of the 1988 UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, was dedicated to the ‘World drug problem’. A third Special Session on drugs, UNGASS 2016, has been convened from 19–21 April 2016 in New York to: ‘Assess ongoing achievements and challenges in countering the world drugs problem’.  Why was UNGASS 2016 convened? In October 2012, a resolution was proposed by Mexico, Guatemala and Colombia to convene a UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on drugs in April 2016. This proposal was accepted by the General Assembly in December 2012 (Resolution 67/193) (1). The fact that 95 UN members decided to co-sponsor this resolution, including some EU Member States, indicates widespread international agreement that a new global discussion on the world drug problem was necessary (2). The original proposal from Mexico, Guatemala and Colombia for the Special Session appears to have been motivated by a number of issues, including: growing concerns around levels of drug-related violence in parts of Latin America; recent comments from some political leaders in the region and civil society organisations on the need for an opportunity for a new international dialogue on the drugs problem; and the effectiveness of current international policies in this area.  The aim of the Special Session, as stipulated in a Resolution (67/193), is to ‘review the progress in the implementation of the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem’ and to assess ‘achievements and challenges in countering the world drug problem within the framework of the three international drug control conventions and other relevant United Nations instruments’.  The discussions at the Special Session are likely to be wide ranging, addressing all the aspects of the world drug situation that members of the General Assembly view as relevant and requiring review at this time. It is foreseen that UNGASS will adopt an action-oriented document comprising a set of operational recommendations to effectively address and counter the world drugs problem (3).  What is the position of the EU Member States at UNGASS 2016? The European Union has an agreed common position paper which will provide a basis for their contribution to discussions at the Special Session (4). At a top level, the EU position can be summarised as supporting balanced and evidence-based drug policies, emphasising the importance of respect for human rights and shared responsibility and working within the overall context provided by the UN international drug control conventions. The European consensus is explicitly based on a commitment to the UN conventions, which are seen as providing sufficient scope and flexibility to accommodate a wide range of approaches to drug policy which can be developed in the context of differing national and regional specificities. In its common position, adopted on 11 November 2015, the EU reiterates the need for countries to respect human rights when implementing the international conventions. In this context, it calls for the abolition of the death penalty for drug-related crimes and for proportional sentencing and alternative measures to conviction or punishment.  Protecting the health and welfare of mankind is an integral part of the international response to the global drugs problem. In this context, the EU calls for the rebalancing of drug policy towards health-oriented approaches.  In the paper, the EU stresses that international cooperation needs to be strengthened in order to identify, disrupt and dismantle transnational organised criminal groups involved in any illicit activities relating to drug trafficking. It also strongly advocates the use of reliable monitoring, best practice and scientific evidence in informing drug policy. Outcome document ready for adoption at UNGASS 2016 The 59th session of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) closed on 23 March with agreement on an ‘outcome document’ to be adopted at UNGASS in April 2016 (5).  The UN General Assembly resolution 70/181 of 17 December 2015 requested the CND to produce a short, substantive, concise and action-oriented document to be recommended for adoption at UNGASS 2016, taking place in New York from 19–21 April 2016.  The CND has now transmitted the outcome document — entitled ‘Our joint commitment to effectively addressing and countering the world drug problem’ — to the General Assembly, recommending its adoption during the UNGASS plenary session. The document is one of a number of resolutions passed at the latest CND on matters ranging from mainstreaming gender perspectives into drug-related policies and programmes, to development and dissemination of the international standards of treatment of drug use disorders. Other topics of the resolutions passed included alternative development and strategies for improving health and social wellbeing.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/ungass-2016_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0281	2016-04-07	UNK	Director's speech: presentation of the EU Drug Markets Report, LIBE Committee, European Parliament, Brussels	 Dear Chair, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to present to you today the second EU Drug Markets Report that was launched on Tuesday with Commissioner Avramopoulos and my colleague Rob Wainwright, Director of Europol. This report is built on a synthesis of operational intelligence and expertise provided by Europol, together with research data and information available from the on-going monitoring of the drugs situation by the EMCDDA and its network of national focal points. This is what makes this report unique — it provides a strategic analysis that is only made possible by integrating data, intelligence and contextual information from two different worlds, demand and supply reduction. What has changed since the publication of the first EU Drug Markets Report? What is new? What is the new knowledge that, from working together with Europol, we will present to you today? First of all, we have, for the first time, produced an estimate of the size of the illicit drug market in the EU:  this is worth at least EUR 24 billion per annum (range: EUR 21 to 31 billion). The market share for each of the main drugs being used in Europe is as follows: 38 % for cannabis           (EUR 9.3 billion), 28 % for heroin (EUR 6.8 billion), 24 % for cocaine (EUR 5.7 billion), 8 % for amphetamine and methamphetamine (EUR 1.8 billion) and 3 % (EUR 0.7 billion) for ecstasy/MDMA, respectively. For new psychoactive substances, or NPS, which includes a large number of substances that are sold openly as ‘legal’ replacements for illicit drugs, we do not yet have an estimate. But what is sure is that the number, type and availability of these substances are showing no signs of slowing down. 100 new substances were reported to us for the first time in 2015 and the EU Early Warning System currently monitors more than 560 substances, of which 78 % have appeared over the last five years. For each of these substances or groups of substances, the report provides a comprehensive analysis of the situation and proposes points for action. The report also describes four main ways in which drug markets impact on society, through: Their links with other types of criminal activity and terrorism Their impact on legal businesses and the wider economy The strain on, and corruption of, government institutions The negative effects they have on society more broadly (e.g. drug-related crime and violence, environmental damage and harms to families and communities). We go on to analyse the main drivers of drug market change, showing how the developments associated with globalisation are key drivers for change and innovation in drug markets. As mentioned by Mr Avramopoulos, it is important to highlight the influential role the internet plays in the drugs business, providing both sales outlets and opportunities to shorten the supply chain, while reducing opportunities for law-enforcement interventions. The EU drug market is driven by two simple motives: profit and power. Understanding this, and the wider impacts of drug markets on society, is critical if we are to reduce drug-related harm. This knowledge is essential for the development of new strategies for tackling crime and safeguarding the health, security and prosperity of our citizens. Lastly, but of considerable importance, is the recognition that the drug market concept is one where the supply of drugs interacts with the demand for these substances. In order to adequately address the negative consequences of the drug market, both for individuals and for society as a whole, effective drug prevention, treatment and harm reduction interventions are as important as interventions aimed at reducing supply. Dear Chair, Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Colleagues, Since we last published this report just three years ago, we have witnessed: an acceleration in the rate at which the drug market is changing; associating shifting patterns of drug use; cultural and social changes; wider criminal activities; and increased complexity of the activities of Organised Crime Groups in Europe. New aggressive marketing strategies and the use of the internet for increased production and reaching/creating new consumer markets have also played a significant role. Today, we are facing competing priorities: terrorism in the heart of Europe; Member States coping with mass migration; increasing instability and conflict in zones near the EU (Ukraine, Syria, but also the Southern Caucasus). These factors create a perfect storm that threatens to undermine the successful drug policies in place in Europe. That is why this report is an important and timely reminder that we cannot and we will not lose focus of the drugs situation, but continue to work to provide better strategic analysis and added value to our stakeholders. You can count on the commitment of the EMCDDA to cooperate together with Europol, the other agencies in the area of Justice and Home Affairs, the EU Institutions and the EU Member States on this important challenge.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/speeches/2016/presentation-of-EU-Drug-Markets-Report-to-European-Parliament_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0282	2016-04-05	UNK	New report highlights wide-ranging impact of EU drug markets on society	 The 2016 EU Drug Markets Report, published today by the EMCDDA and Europol, estimates that Europeans spend at least EUR 24 billion on illicit drugs each year, making it one of the main profit-generating activities for organised criminals in Europe. The report provides a state-of-the-art analysis of the EU illicit drug market, covering the trends along the supply chain from production and trafficking to marketing, distribution and consumption. It also analyses the considerable costs of these markets for society including their impact on businesses, government institutions, neighbourhoods, families, individuals and the environment. Presenting the report’s findings Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship said: ‘Today’s drug business criminals are quick to exploit and harm global flows of transport, goods and people, while posing a threat to public health. They use new technology and the internet, the growth of global trade and commercial infrastructure to perform their criminal activities rapidly across international borders. In addition, the instability in regions neighbouring the EU could have potentially profound effects on the drug market in Europe. This valuable report explores the links to other criminal activities and how the illicit income from the drug trade can fund migrant smuggling and terrorism, and undermine international development efforts.’ Alexis Goosdeel, EMCDDA Director, added ‘The EU drug market is driven by two simple motives: profit and power. Understanding this, and the wider impacts of drug markets on society, is critical if we are to reduce drug-related harm. This knowledge is essential for the development of new strategies for tackling crime and safeguarding the health, security and prosperity of our citizens’. Rob Wainwright, Europol Director, said ‘Illicit drug production and trafficking remains one of the largest and most innovative criminal markets in Europe. As it grows more complex and becomes entwined with other forms of crime, and even terrorism, it represents a key threat to the internal security of the EU. Concerted cross-border law-enforcement cooperation is essential in reducing its scale and impact, and this can be achieved through the unique operational capabilities of Europol and other EU instruments’. The report — accompanied by a Strategic Overview — combines the EMCDDA’s drug monitoring and analytical skills with Europol’s operational intelligence on trends in organised crime. It describes a market which is constantly evolving, adaptable and opportunistic, posing a key challenge for policy-makers, law-enforcement agencies and public health.   The report shows that, while traditional trafficking routes persist, diversification continues. Routes appear to be less commodity-specific than before, whilst legitimate transport and logistic infrastructures continue to be exploited, with maritime containers representing a convenient channel for large consignments of drugs to be imported into Europe. Recent developments in internet markets including the dark net, anonymising software and crypto-currencies also offer new opportunities for online drug supply. Three main themes emerge from the analysis in the report: Increasing links between drug trafficking and other forms of crime: organised crime groups involved in the drug market are diversifying across multiple drugs, engaging in other forms of criminality including terrorism, forming alliances across ethnic and geographical borders and harnessing specialist expertise. Accelerated rate of change in the drug market due to globalisation and technology: criminal groups are quick to exploit opportunities provided by easier access to information, the internet and the growth in international trade. Geographical concentration of groups specialised in drug related crimes: drug production or trafficking are concentrated in specific geographical locations, within Europe and elsewhere; some are long established, while new zones are also emerging (e.g. heroin trafficking through the Southern Caucasus). The report highlights how coordinated action at EU level can make a difference in tackling the illicit drugs trade and outlines a comprehensive range of recommendations and action points in key areas to inform future policies and initiatives. The EU Drugs Strategy (2013–20) and Action Plan (2013–16) provide a framework for addressing illicit drugs in the EU, complementing Member States’ national strategies. The overarching objective is a measurable reduction of the availability of illicit drugs through the disruption of trafficking, dismantling of Organised Crime Groups, efficient use of the criminal justice system, effective intelligence-led law enforcement and increased intelligence sharing, and an EU-level emphasis on large-scale, cross-border and organised drug-related crime.

EMCDDA_UNK_0283	2016-04-05	UNK	Speech by EMCDDA Director on the occasion of the launch of EU Drug Markets Report, Brussels	 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to be here today with Commissioner Avramopoulos and with my colleague Rob Wainwright, Director of Europol, to launch the second EU Drug Markets Report. I would first like to express our solidarity with Belgian citizens and authorities, with the victims and their families, after the tragic recent events that took place here in the heart of Europe. I would also like to say how important it is for me and for my team to be in Belgium with you to launch the report today against considerable odds. What has changed since the publication of the first Drug Markets Report? What is new? What is the new knowledge that, working together with Europol, we will present to you today? First of all, we have for the first time produced an estimate of the size of the illicit drug market in the EU:  this is worth at least EUR 24 billion per annum (range: EUR 21 to 31 billion). The market share for each of the main drugs being used in Europe is as follows: 38 % for cannabis (9.3 billion €), 28 % for heroin (6.8 billion €), 24 % for cocaine (5.7 billion €), 8 % for amphetamine and methamphetamine (1.8 billion €) and 3 % (0.7 billion €) for ecstasy/MDMA, respectively. For new psychoactive substances, or NPS, which includes a large number of substances that are sold openly as ‘legal’ replacements for illicit drugs, we do not yet have an estimate. But what is sure is that the number, type and availability of these substances are showing no signs of slowing down in; 100 new substances were reported to us for the first time in 2015 and the EU Early Warning System currently monitors more than 560 substances, of which 78 % have appeared over the last five years. For each of these substances or groups of substances, the report gives a comprehensive analysis of the situation and proposes points for action. The report also describes four main ways in which drug markets impact on society, through: their links with other types of criminal activity and terrorism; their impact on legal businesses and the wider economy; the strain on and corruption of government institutions they create; and the negative effects they have on society more broadly (e.g. drug-related crime and violence, environmental damage and harms to families and communities). We go on to analyse the main drivers of drug market change, showing how the developments associated with globalisation are key drivers for change and innovation in drug markets. As mentioned by Mr Avramopoulos, it is important to highlight the influential role the internet plays in the drugs business, providing both sales outlets and opportunities to shorten the supply chain, while reducing opportunities for law-enforcement interventions. The EU drug market is driven by two simple motives: profit and power. Understanding this, and the wider impact drug markets have on society, is critical if we are to reduce drug-related harm. This knowledge is essential for the development of new strategies for tackling crime and safeguarding the health, security and prosperity of our citizens. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, Since we last published this report just three years ago, we have witnessed an acceleration in the rate at which the drug market is changing, associating shifting patterns of drug use, cultural and social changes, wider criminal activities, and an increased complexity of the activities of Organised Crime Groups in Europe. New aggressive marketing strategies and the use of the internet for increased production and reaching/creating new consumer markets have also played a significant role. Today, we are facing competing priorities: terrorism in the heart of Europe, Member States coping with mass migration; increasing instability and conflict in zones near the EU (Ukraine, Syria, but also the Southern Caucasus). These factors create a perfect storm that threatens to undermine the successful drug policies in place in Europe and that is why this report is an important and timely reminder that we can not, we will not lose focus of the drugs situation, but continue to work to provide better strategic analysis and added value to our stakeholders. You can count on the commitment of the EMCDDA to cooperate together with Europol, the other Agencies in the area of Justice and Home Affairs, the EU Institutions and the EU Member States on this important challenge.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/speeches/2016/launch-of-EU-Drug-Markets-Report_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0284	2016-03-15	UNK	EMCDDA presents latest advances in monitoring illicit drugs in wastewater	 The latest advances in the science of wastewater analysis are presented by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) today in a new report Assessing illicit drugs in wastewater (1). The report is being presented in Vienna at an event — ‘Use of wastewater analysis to understand drug markets’ — being held in the margins of the annual meeting of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND)(2).  Wastewater analysis is a rapidly developing scientific discipline with the potential for monitoring near-real-time data on geographical and temporal trends in illicit drug use. By sampling a known source of wastewater (e.g. a sewage influent to a wastewater treatment plant), scientists can estimate the quantity of drugs used in a community by measuring the levels of illicit drugs and their metabolites excreted in urine.  The EMCDDA adopts a multi-indicator approach to drug monitoring on the principle that no single measure can provide a full picture of the drug situation. It views wastewater analysis as a valuable additional tool in its epidemiological toolkit and one which can provide timely information on a wide spectrum of substances. Alexis Goosdeel, EMCDDA Director says: ‘Wastewater-based epidemiology has demonstrated its potential to become a useful complement to established drug monitoring tools. Its ability to deliver almost real-time data on drug use patterns is particularly relevant against the backdrop of an ever-shifting drugs problem. By detecting changes in drug use patterns, both geographically and over time, it can help health and treatment services respond better to emerging trends and changing treatment needs’.   The report explores the latest findings from the worldwide application of wastewater-based epidemiology and the advances that have occurred in since 2008. These include developments to reduce uncertainties and to standardise procedures, including a best practice protocol, developed by the Sewage analysis CORe group Europe (SCORE) network. Two case studies (Norway, Italy) show the first attempts to compare cocaine-use estimates obtained through wastewater analysis with conventional epidemiological data gathered through population surveys. Also described are three new approaches for dealing with new psychoactive substances (NPS). These include using pooled urine samples from nightclubs and music festivals to provide timely data on which NPS are being used and where. Detecting and estimating the use of NPS presents a particular challenge for drug epidemiology due to the rapid rise in their number and availability (101 NPS were detected in 2014).  Finally, the report highlights gaps and requirements for future research, including the need for addressing the ethical aspects of wastewater-based epidemiology. Better integration of this novel methodology with existing epidemiological indicators will allow for a better understanding of the drug situation in Europe.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/emcdda-presents-latest-advances-wastewater-analysis_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0285	2016-03-11	UNK	59th Commission on Narcotic Drugs, 14–22 March 2016, Vienna	 The United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND), the central UN policy-making body in drug-related matters, opens its 59th session in Vienna this month (14–22 March). The CND meets every year to discuss the global state of drug control and to adopt resolutions to guide the way forward. An EMCDDA delegation is attending the event and, throughout the week, will provide technical support to the European Commission and EU Member States as well as participate in a series of side events. The upcoming session includes a special segment on the preparation for the UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on drugs being held in New York from 19–21 April. News from the EMCDDA delegation Visitors are welcome to the EMCDDA publications stand on the first floor of the M-building. Monday 14 March Side event: Decriminalizing drug use — concept and practice 1.10–2.00 p.m., conference room M7 Organised by the Government of the Czech Republic, the International Drug Policy Consortium and Release. Depenalisation, decriminalisation and legalisation. There is no universal agreement on these terms, but it is helpful to explore the different ideas that lie behind them if we are to understand better what they mean when they are used in the debate on different approaches to controlling the supply and use of drugs. Watch the EMCDDA video explaining the terminology. Tuesday 15 March Side event: New psychoactive substances — a comparison of legislative responses 9.00–9.50 a.m., conference room M3 Organised by the Governments of the United Kingdom and Colombia and the UNODC Laboratory and Scientific Section. New psychoactive substances, or in short NPS, are narcotic or psychotropic drugs that are not under international control. This means that they are not listed in the United Nations Conventions of 1961 or 71, the international treaties that state which drugs are under control such as cocaine, cannabis and heroin. Side event: Copolad II — Towards an improved response to drugs challenges 1.10–2.00 p.m., conference room M3 Organised by the Government of the Netherlands, the Delegation of the European Union to the International Organizations in Vienna and the European Commission. Following the successful completion of the flagship European Union cooperation programme in the field of drugs policies with Latin America — COPOLAD, a new COPOLAD II programme has been recently launched. During this side event the leaders and participants of the programme from the European Union, Latin America and Caribbean countries, representatives of the European Commission and the EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel will give an overview of the achievements so far and perspectives for the new phase, as a contribution to tackle the world drug problem in a more efficient manner. Side event: Alternatives to imprisonment and proportionate responses to drug offences 1.30–3.00 p.m., conference room BR-A Organised by the Governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and Colombia, the World Health Organization, the UNODC Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Branch, the UNODC Justice Section and the National Association of Drug Court Professionals (UNODC). In recent years, Europe’s policymakers have come under increasing pressure to find effective and appropriate responses to manage people who come into contact with the  criminal justice system for drug law offences. Based on the options provided by the international drug control legal framework, an EMCDDA Paper on this topic considers the rehabilitative measures of treating, educating or reintegrating drug users as alternatives or additions to conviction or punishment that are established in the laws of many countries in Europe today.

The last decade has seen the emergence of new internet technologies that have acted as important facilitators of online drug markets. The internet now hosts a range of virtual marketplaces (both on the surface and deep web) for selling and buying illicit substances, as well as representing a new arena for health and law enforcement interventions. This first EMCDDA investigation into the world of online drug markets brings together state-of-the-art input from over 20 experts — from academia, journalism and frontline practice — and contributes to the knowledge base on this part of the supply chain. Download the EMCDDA publication on this topic >>   Thursday 17 March Side event: Early Warning Systems on NPS — practical responses to a growing problem 2.20–3.10 p.m., conference room M3 Organised by the UNODC Laboratory and Scientific Section and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. Since 1997, the EMCDDA has played a central role in Europe's response to new psychoactive substances. Its main responsibilities in this field are to operate the EU Early Warning System, with its partner Europol, and to undertake risk assessments of new substances when necessary. EU Early Warning System works  by collecting information on the appearance of new substances from the 28 EU Member States, Turkey and Norway, and then monitoring them for signals of harm, allowing the EU to respond rapidly to emerging threats. Friday 18 March Afghan Opiate Trade Programme Advisory Group Meeting 1.00–2.00 p.m., room C06 Paul Griffiths, Scientific director of the EMCDDA, will participate in the Afghan Opiate Trade Programme Advisory Group Meeting. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/cnd_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0286	2016-03-04	UNK	Evaluation of the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan (2013–2016): public consultation	 The EU Drugs Strategy provides a political framework and priorities for action in the field of drug policies for the period 2013–2020. It is structured around two policy fields: drug demand reduction and drug supply reduction; and three cross-cutting themes: coordination, international cooperation and information, research, monitoring and evaluation. The strategy is implemented through two EU Action Plans on Drugs, the first of which (2013–2016) will come to a close this year. In view of preparing the second action plan (2017–2020), the European Commission has launched a public consultation, which will run until Europe Day (9 May). All EU and non-EU citizens and stakeholders are invited to contribute to this consultation. Contributions are sought from individuals, local, regional and national authorities, international and regional organisations, intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, academic institutions, third countries, social partners and civil society. The consultation seeks to gather views on the five objectives of the EU Drugs Strategy (and corresponding actions) and on the following evaluation criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, coherence and EU added value. The public consultation will provide an important contribution to the evidence base for the mid-term evaluation of the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan (2013–2016). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/evaluation-eu-drugs-strategy-and-action-plan-2013%E2%80%932016-public-consultation_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0287	2016-03-01	UNK	Upcoming strategic analysis of the European drug market 	 Illicit drugs are big business. They are one of the main profit-generating activities of organised crime and are estimated to represent around one-fifth of global crime proceeds. The negative impacts of illicit drug markets are multifaceted and far-reaching, which is why they remain a key threat to the security of the European Union and the safety of its citizens. Next month, ahead of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Drugs (UNGASS),  two EU agencies — the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and Europol — will release their latest state-of-the-art report on the EU drug market, providing a detailed analysis of this important policy-relevant field. The 2016 EU Drug Markets Report — In-depth Analysis will be launched at a press conference in Brussels on 5 April by Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship. The Commissioner will be joined by EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel and Europol Director Rob Wainwright. The report — with its companion Strategic Overview summarising key findings — combines the analytical power of the EMCDDA’s drug monitoring system with Europol’s operational intelligence on trends in organised crime. The first part of the report explores the wide-ranging ramifications of the illicit drug market, including: its impact on the licit economy; links to other forms of criminal activity; corruption and the strain on governments.  The drivers of change are also examined, providing a unique strategic and action-orientated analysis to inform policy development at EU and national level. Individual chapters then focus on markets for: cannabis; heroin and other opioids; cocaine; amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDMA; and new psychoactive substances. The report ends with an overview of the main structures, policies and strategies in the EU for addressing drug supply reduction and highlights some of the operational actions undertaken by the EU, its Member States and international partners. Launch date: Tuesday 5 April 2016 Time: 13:30 (Central European Time) Press conference: European Commission, press room, Berlaymont, Brussels.

EMCDDA_UNK_0288	2016-02-11	UNK	New EMCDDA report: the internet and drug markets	 How do online drug markets function? What technologies do they use? How do they relate to the traditional drug market? How can they be monitored and controlled? Today the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) unravels some of the complexities of these questions in a new report: The internet and drug markets (1). Over the last decade, virtual markets have been changing the dynamics of how drugs are bought and sold. Although it is estimated that most illicit drug transactions are still played out offline, online drug markets have the potential to transform drug sales in the future, in the same way as online shopping has revolutionised the retail experience. According to the report, a wide range of factors appear to be driving developments in internet drug markets ‘mostly linked to technology, globalisation and market innovation’.  Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, says: ‘Almost any kind of illegal drug can be bought today on the internet and delivered by mail, with no face-to-face contact between buyer and dealer. The illicit market is evolving, and so should our efforts to eliminate it. We should stop the abuse of the internet by those wanting to turn it into a drug market. Technology is offering fresh opportunities for law enforcement to tackle online drug markets and reduce threats to public health. Let us seize these opportunities to attack the problem head-on and reduce drug supply online’. This new EMCDDA investigation into the world of online drug markets brings together state-of-the-art evidence from over 20 experts — from academia, journalism and frontline practice — and contributes to the knowledge base on this part of the supply chain. Alexis Goosdeel EMCDDA Director says: ‘Whether in open drug scenes or a dealer’s flat, low-level drug sales have historically been associated with real people and real places. While most dealing remains firmly rooted in this physical world, virtual marketplaces are now expanding the boundaries of drug supply, offering wider options to potential buyers. This is a worrying development as digital literacy increases, technologies advance and the range of available drugs diversifies. The EMCDDA will continue its close monitoring of the fast-changing world of internet drug markets and highlight gaps for future research. Bringing together the latest international expertise, this report represents our first detailed exploration of the issue’. Upcoming expert meeting on the internet and drugs How to tackle the online drug trade will be the focus of an expert meeting on the internet and drugs, to be organised by the European Commission in Brussels on 7 and 8 June. The aim of the meeting, taking place in the framework of the EU internet forum, will be to agree on a common definition of the problem and to look closely at current responses in the EU Member States and internationally. Options for future common action will also be explored. The meeting will gather experts from the EU Member States and third countries, as well as researchers and representatives from civil society, industry and relevant EU agencies and international organisations. The EMCDDA will be actively participating in this meeting. The report describes how online drug markets operate on the ‘surface web’ (accessible via common search engines) as well as the ‘deep web’ (inaccessible via standard browsers)(2). The report also explores ‘dark net’ markets residing on the ‘deep web’. Otherwise known as ‘cryptomarkets’, these allow goods and services to be exchanged between parties who use digital currencies (e.g. bitcoin) and digital encryption software (e.g. Tor) to conceal their identities (3). The growth of social media has also seen online fora and mobile ‘apps’ emerge, where drugs are discussed, advertised and sometimes sold. According to the report, the ‘surface web’ is primarily associated with the distribution of non-controlled substances (e.g. new psychoactive substances/‘legal highs’, medicines, precursor chemicals), or substances around which there may be legal ambiguities (e.g. due to differences in national legislation). By contrast, most sales activity linked to illicit drugs appears to take place on the ‘deep web’. Interventions to reduce both supply and demand for drugs have been gathering pace on the ‘surface web’ (e.g. online information campaigns)(4). Health and law enforcement professionals are also seizing opportunities on the ‘deep web’. The report describes the growing interest in the provision of health-related interventions to ‘dark net’ users (5). Law enforcement agencies are also building up experience in the area of monitoring online drug markets and are tackling supply by disrupting markets, reducing trust around anonymity and prosecuting ‘cryptomarket’ sellers (6). The report concludes: ‘The speed with which the internet allows transformation to occur in drug markets will continue to present major challenges across the board, to law enforcement, public health, research and monitoring agencies’. The EMCDDA will continue to explore questions posed by this dynamic environment and contribute to understanding of the current online supply of drugs. Coming soon: On 5 April, the EMCDDA and Europol are joining forces to launch their second EU Drug Markets Report in Brussels. The 2016 report will be launched by European Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos. The Commissioner will be joined at the press conference by EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel and Europol Director Rob Wainwright. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/2/internet-drug-markets_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0289	2016-02-04	UNK	Council of EU representatives visit EMCDDA	 Representatives of the Justice Affairs Directorate of the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU will visit the EMCDDA on 4 February where they will meet the agency’s Director Alexis Goosdeel and staff. Discussions will focus on the EMCDDA’s long-term strategy (2025); priorities arising from the work programme 2016; key issues relating to the detection of new drugs via the EU Early Warning System and ongoing and future cooperation. The visitors will include: Nathalie Pensaert (Director for Justice); Ralph Kaessner (Head of unit — Fundamental Rights, Data Protection and Drugs Policies); and Pawel Nalewajko and Jurga Valanciute (Political administrators). The Horizontal Working Party on Drugs (HDG), the principal platform for information sharing and political decision-making on EU drug policy falls under the responsibility of the General Secretariat, as does the Internal Security Committee (COSI), which promotes and strengthens coordination between the EU Member States in the field of internal security. The EMCDDA provides regular insight and evidence-based information on the drug phenomenon to these two fora.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/council-eu-representatives-visit-emcdda_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0290	2016-01-25	UNK	Director presents EMCDDA strategy and work programme 2016–18 and annual work programme 2016 at European Parliament	 EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel is at the European Parliament today where he will be presenting to members of the Committee for Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) highlights from the EMCDDA strategy and work programme 2016–18 and the 2016 annual work programme. At the heart of the new strategy and work programme is the EMCDDA’s vision to contribute to a more secure and a healthier Europe. This overarching commitment will drive the agency in the coming years and guide it in delivering added value to its stakeholders. A greater emphasis on knowledge-transfer, strategic analysis and threat assessment will be the main drivers to achieving this goal. Ensuring the security of the EU is now, more than ever, a top priority. Tackling drug-related threats is an integral part of this effort, as highlighted by the recently adopted European Agenda on Security 2015–20. Here the EMCDDA will provide EU policymakers with timely information and analysis to support prompt and sound reactions. One example of this contribution will be the publication of the second EU Drug Markets Report, a state-of-the-art strategic analysis of the illicit drug markets in the EU, to be published with Europol on 5 April 2016. Better understanding of the global dimension of the drug phenomenon is vital for tackling EU threats. To this end, the agency will continue to support the European Commission in its endeavour to provide technical assistance to candidate, potential candidate and neighbouring countries to the EU, with the aim of informing sound EU drug policies with these countries. Fulfilling the agency’s vision for 2016–18 also means contributing to the health of EU citizens. This will include continuing the successful collaboration with partners in the prevention of infectious diseases among people who inject drugs, focusing in particular on HIV and hepatitis C, which remain major public health concerns. A new top level publication, the EU Drug Responses Report, will be launched in 2017. This will provide a state-of-the-art overview of the responses to drugs across the EU as well as recommendations for action. The EU Drug Responses Report, the EU Drug Markets Report and the annual European Drug Report: Trends and Developments, together will provide the complete picture of the drug phenomenon and an essential information and analysis package for policymakers from the EU and beyond. Finally, the EMCDDA will continue to play the central role in Europe’s response to new psychoactive substances, which represent one of the most rapidly growing threats to the health of EU citizens. The agency will ensure that the EU Early Warning System, which it operates together with its partners, is able to meet the challenges ahead and provide a rapid response to protect public health.   The presentation will take place from 18.10 to 18.45 (CET) and will be web streamed — see 'Today's broadcasts' 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/director-presents-strategy-and-work-programmes-at-european-parliament_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0291	2016-01-18	UNK	New EMCDDA insights into naloxone, the overdose antidote that can help save lives	 Between 6 000 and 8 000 drug-induced deaths are reported in Europe every year, with opioids, such as heroin, found in most overdose cases. Yet with adequate intervention, using the overdose-reversal drug naloxone, many of these deaths can be prevented. This issue is explored today in a new report from the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) entitled Preventing opioid overdose deaths with take-home naloxone (1). Naloxone — a pharmaceutical drug used to reverse respiratory depression caused by opioid overdose — has been used in emergency medicine since the 1970s (2). Listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an ‘essential medicine’, it is traditionally available in injectable form, although non-injectable formulations of the drug are now emerging. WHO guidelines on community-based naloxone provision were published in 2014 (3). Research shows that many opioid overdoses occur in the presence of bystanders, who, if empowered to act appropriately, have the potential to save lives while waiting for emergency services to arrive at the scene (4). This has led to the emergence of naloxone as a harm-reduction measure since the 1990s, with the provision of take-home naloxone kits to opioid users and those likely to witness opioid overdoses. ‘Each of the lives lost every day in Europe to opioid overdose is worth all our efforts to improve prevention and responses’, says EMCDDA Director Alexis Goosdeel. ‘Empowering bystanders to deliver a potentially life-saving intervention is an important step in a diversified and balanced European response to drugs’. In Europe, take-home naloxone initiatives currently operate at city level in Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Italy, the UK (England) and Norway, and at regional level in Spain (Catalonia) and the UK (Scotland and Wales). A number of other EU countries are also exploring the practice and considering adding take-home naloxone to the existing range of interventions to prevent drug-related deaths (5). Following on from a 2015 EMCDDA review of the effectiveness of take-home naloxone (6), today’s report provides practitioners and policymakers with a comprehensive, up-to-date review of the evidence base on the issue. Examining the case for distributing naloxone, the report traces the drug’s historical developments, presents examples of good practice and training and considers ongoing debates on naloxone availability and legal frameworks. Legal barriers and developments On the issue of legal barriers in the EU, the report says: ‘In most jurisdictions, naloxone is a prescription-only medicine and its use is restricted to medical personnel or to patients to whom it is prescribed. The introduction of take-home naloxone provision in some countries would therefore require adjustments to be made to current regulations’. In some jurisdictions, the notification of overdose events can trigger a report to the police, which may discourage overdose witnesses from contacting emergency medical services. The report describes how the dissemination of take-home naloxone has been facilitated by the introduction of so-called ‘Good Samaritan’ legislation in some countries (Luxembourg, Scotland, some US states), which exempt lay responders from liability when they offer assistance. Although most EU Member States have not implemented formal legal provisions for take-home naloxone, a number of communities and countries have clarified the legal status of prescribing and administering it. Options for the future: new products Naloxone formulations are currently licensed in injectable form, which can prove a psychological obstacle for non-medical responders as well as a health risk for all those administering the drug. Safer and easier routes of administration are currently under development, which could contribute to the drug’s wider use. In November 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a concentrated nasal naloxone preparation. This important breakthrough in facilitating naloxone use by overdose witnesses raises the prospect of nasal naloxone becoming available in the EU in the near future. In Europe, pilot nasal spray naloxone programmes are currently running in Denmark and Norway, while the feasibility of a buccal tablet is being explored in the UK. Training family and friends: an essential element The training of family and friends is increasingly being recognised as an essential element of urgent interim overdose management using naloxone. It helps bystanders become familiar with the medication and the legalities around it and feel competent to use it as they wait for emergency responders. Take-home naloxone training may vary in intensity and coverage, with the choice of the training level determined by the setting, target group needs and available resources. Among the issues covered in training are the potential side-effects of naloxone use, including acute opioid withdrawal symptoms and the risk of post-recovery re-intoxication as the effects of the naloxone wear off. Improving availability to save more lives Reducing fatal drug overdoses remains an important challenge for public health policy. According to today’s report: ‘Action is urgently needed to improve take-home naloxone availability’, with the antidote currently available in less than a third of the 28 EU Member States. Some 50 years after its original manufacture, naloxone remains the drug of choice for reversing opioid overdose. This report shares existing experience with the medication in order to broaden the current knowledge base for decision-making and for improving emergency treatment responses. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/1/preventing-opioid-overdose-naloxone_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0292	2016-01-08	UNK	Registration opens for fifth European drugs summer school	 The University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL) and the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) will be joining forces this summer to hold the fifth European drugs summer school (EDSS) on ‘Illicit drugs in Europe: demand, supply and public policies’ (1). Registration opens today for the two-week course, which will take place in the Portuguese capital from 27 June to 8 July (2). The initiative is also supported by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Through a multidisciplinary and interactive approach to the drugs problem, EMCDDA scientific experts, leading academics, guest speakers and policymakers, will prepare participants to meet the complex policy challenges in this field — both in Europe and beyond. This year the focus of the course will be on the evidence base for policymaking on drug-related issues. Keynote speakers will consider the outcomes of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Drugs (UNGASS), taking place in New York in April 2016. Week 1 of the summer school focuses on ‘Drug policies and the production of evidence’ and will feature lectures on: UNGASS 2016; evidence in harm reduction; drug markets in Europe; detecting new drugs; and prevention. This session will also focus on the EMCDDA’s epidemiological indicators and their use in informing drug policy. Week 2 is dedicated to ‘Policymaking for drug-related issues’, including lectures on: drug policies (concepts, issues and analysis); the EU drug strategy; drug laws and public expenditure; and monitoring supply reduction and drug enforcement activity. Week 2 will conclude with an analysis of the link between evidence and decision-making and will include study visits and an open debate. The target audiences for the EDSS are: university students, researchers, professionals and administrators interested in working on drug issues. The previous rounds of the summer school brought together students from the EU Member States as well as representatives from Asia and Latin America. Based on feedback from previous editions, more space will be devoted this year to student-led workshops and discussions. Profiles of former alumni and their testimonials can be found on the official summer school website and their statements viewed in a promotional video. In 2016, students will again be able to apply for scholarships and ‘Early-bird’ reductions are available (3). The EDSS is run in English. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/fs2/registration-fifth-european-drugs-summer-school_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0293	2016-01-04	UNK	Alexis Goosdeel at helm of EU drugs agency	 Alexis Goosdeel (Belgium) took up the post of EMCDDA Director on 1 January 2016, having been formally appointed to the position by the agency’s Management Board in October 2015 for a five-year term (1). Speaking on his appointment, Mr Goosdeel said: ‘It is with great enthusiasm and motivation that I take up the post of EMCDDA Director, as the agency enters its third decade. I sincerely believe that the EMCDDA has an exciting future ahead of it; a future in which it will continue to build on its strengths and transform and re-invent itself within the boundaries of its remit.’ He added: ‘During its first 20 years, the agency witnessed great changes in the drug phenomenon but also in the priorities of decision-makers and their information needs. In tune with these developments, and to remain policy-relevant and useful to its stakeholders, the agency will move progressively from an information-centred model to a service-oriented model, providing tailored analysis to its customers’. Mr Goosdeel joined the EMCDDA in 1999 as a project manager working in the area of EU enlargement and international relations. From 2005, he headed the agency’s Reitox and international cooperation unit. In this capacity, he played a central role in: coordinating a network of 30 national drug monitoring centres; preparing EU candidate and potential candidate countries for membership of the EMCDDA; developing cooperation with neighbouring countries to the EU; and nurturing relations with countries beyond the Union (Central Asia, Russia, Latin America). Mr Goosdeel has spent much of his 30-year career working in the field of public health at national, European and international level. He was one of the founders of Modus Vivendi, a Belgian NGO working in the area of harm reduction. Before joining the agency, he directed Alizés, a Brussels-based, European association working for development and cooperation in public health (1992–99). Mr Goosdeel holds a Master’s degree in clinical psychology and a special diploma in advanced management. He is proficient in six languages: French (mother tongue); English, Spanish, Greek, Portuguese and Dutch. He was born on 7 November 1959 in Brussels.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2016/fs1/alexis-goosdeel-at-helm-eu-drugs-agency_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0294	2015-12-04	UNK	EMCDDA Management Board elects new Chair and Vice-Chair	 The EU drugs agency Management Board kicked off a two-day meeting in Lisbon today, holding elections for Chair and Vice-Chair of the Board (1). Laura d’Arrigo (France), Diplomatic advisor at the French Interministerial Mission for Combating Drugs and Addictive Behaviours (Mission interministérielle de lutte contre les drogues et les conduites addictives — MILDECA) was elected Chair for the next three years. Ms d’Arrigo has been member of the Board since December 2013 and is the first woman to hold the position. After several years working for the EU institutions, in particular the European Commission, Ms d’Arrigo was entrusted by the French authorities in 2007 to contribute to implementing and coordinating French foreign policy in the drugs field, both at bilateral and multilateral level. Between 2010 and 2014, she chaired the Permanent Correspondents of the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe. Ms d’Arrigo takes over the role from João Goulão (Portugal) who has held the position since 2009 and whose mandate ends on 31 December this year. A member of the Management Board since 2005, Mr Goulão served as Chair for two terms (2010–12 and 2013–15). Franz Pietsch (Austria) was elected to the position of Vice-Chair today. Mr Pietsch, who has been a member of the Board since 2002, is representative of Austria regarding international matters of addiction and drug issues and Deputy Director-General and Head of Department for Tobacco, Alcohol, Non-substance-related Addictions and International Affairs of Addiction. He takes over from Claude Gillard (Belgium), founding member of the agency, who held the position for two terms (2010–12 and 2013–15) and whose mandate comes to a close this month. Mr Gillard, a Board member since 1994, has also chaired the EMCDDA Budget Committee since 2003. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz congratulated the new Chair and Vice-Chair and paid tribute to João Goulão and Claude Gillard for their ‘inspiration, collaboration and untiring commitment to steering the Board over the past six years with the utmost transparency and efficiency’. In turn, João Goulão thanked Mr Götz for his dedication over the past 10 years in boosting the scientific performance and efficiency of the agency and providing policymakers with evidence-based information for a more informed and reasoned debate on the drugs problem. Through his focus on international cooperation, Mr Götz had nurtured and furthered the reputation of the EU agency as a globally recognised centre of excellence on drugs. Mr Götz will retire from the agency on 31 December 2015 having headed the agency since 1 May 2005. Alexis Goosdeel (Belgium) takes up the post on 1 January 2016 following elections of the Board in September (2). At today’s meeting, the Board gave its final seal of approval on the agency’s 2016 budget and work programme and its strategy and work programme for 2016–18. The Board also renewed the mandate of its current Scientific Committee for the period 2017–19 (3). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/11/management-board-elections_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0295	2015-11-27	UNK	New EMCDDA report explores combined mental health and substance use disorders	 The co-existence of mental illness and psychoactive drug or other substance use problems — otherwise known as ‘comorbidity’ or ‘dual diagnosis’ — is an issue which has been on the radar of the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) for over a decade (1). As concern around the issue grows, the EMCDDA publishes today the most comprehensive analysis of the topic to date at European level: Comorbidity of substance use and mental disorders in Europe (2). Psychiatric comorbidity is highly prevalent among those with substance use problems; it can lead to increased risk of hospitalisation, suicide and criminal behaviour and is difficult to manage and treat. This literature review provides policymakers and practitioners working in the drugs field with a detailed and timely overview of the concept and the tools available for its assessment and diagnosis. ‘The adequate detection and treatment of comorbid mental and substance use disorders is one of the major challenges that policymakers, professionals and clinicians working in the drugs field will face in the coming years’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘Acknowledging and responding to the reality of such disorders is an important step towards providing better care for the many people who are affected by these interlinked problems’, Götz adds. The link between substance use and mental health problems is a complex one and interaction between the two can play out on many levels. In some cases, the psychiatric disorder may be a risk factor for substance use, while in others it is the substance use that triggers the mental health disorder. Co-existence of the two raises a number of challenges such as chronicity, poor treatment outcomes, increased morbidity and, in some cases, more criminality. Some of the most common combinations of drug use and mental health disorders are presented in the publication, along with the corresponding clinical recommendations and response measures implemented in treatment settings across Europe. The most usual form of comorbidity is the combination of a substance use disorder with depression; while anxiety is also frequent. The use of specific substances may also be associated with a specific mental health condition (e.g. cannabis use with psychosis; opioid use with a range of conditions such as antisocial/borderline personality disorders and eating disorders). Data on the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity among drug users in Europe exist, but are limited and heterogeneous regarding methods and target populations. ‘It remains important to study the occurrence of psychiatric comorbidity in drug users’, says the report, ‘both to determine its magnitude and to help improve the coverage of adequate treatment’. Using validated screening and diagnosis tools The report sets out the range of instruments available today to assess psychiatric comorbidity in those with substance use disorders and presents a selection of tools used for screening and diagnosis. The choice of the most appropriate instrument (or set of instruments) is based on a number of criteria such as: context; assessment objectives; time available and the expertise of the staff. Practical recommendations offered include the use of validated screening and diagnostic instruments. Treating comorbid disorders: challenges Treating individuals suffering from comorbid disorders is challenging due to the complex nature of the condition. Although the issue of providing effective treatment in this area is considered important by drug and mental health professionals, there is a lack of consensus in Europe as to the most appropriate treatment setting and the most fitting pharmacological and psychosocial strategy to adopt. The report describes a number of barriers to treatment including: the separation of mental health and drug use treatment settings in most European countries; insufficient use of combined expertise to treat the two disorders at the same time; and a lack of suitable treatment approaches, regulations and financial resources. Practical recommendations include the consideration and treatment of the two disorders simultaneously from a multi-professional perspective. Types of treatment and how they are organised and implemented across Europe differ considerably. The report presents an overview of existing treatment options (and current gaps) for comorbid disorders in 30 European countries (28 EU Member States, Norway and Turkey) and calls for a more in-depth review of service organisation across Europe. A burden on health and legal systems ‘Taking into account the burden on health and legal systems, comorbid mental disorders among drug users result in high costs for society and lead to challenges not only for clinicians but also for policymakers’, says the report. It adds that one of the key challenges in the coming years will centre on: ‘where, how and for how long to treat these patients’. The report ends with a series of recommendations including: the systematic detection and treatment of comorbid mental health disorders in those with substance use disorders; the development of future studies to improve the evidence base for care and treatment; a review of possible early interventions to identify high-risk cases; and the inclusion of comorbidity items in current reporting systems across Europe. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/10/comorbidity-mental-health-substance-use_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0296	2015-11-24	UNK	Over 40 countries attend 2015 Reitox week in Lisbon	 Representatives of candidate, potential candidate and neighbouring countries of the EU are joining members of the EMCDDA’s Reitox network in Lisbon today for the kick-off of the agency’s fourth Reitox week (1). The purpose of this annual event is to broaden the scope of regular Reitox meetings, underline the importance of the EU drug monitoring model and add impetus to the agency’s technical cooperation with countries outside the EU (2). Reitox — the European information network on drugs and drug addiction — was set up in 1993 and is composed of 30 national monitoring centres or national focal points (NFPs) in the 28 EU Member States, Turkey and Norway, as well as a focal point at the European Commission. The NFPs — from which the agency draws the bulk of its data — collect and analyse national information on drugs, drawing on various sectors including health, justice and law enforcement. The 2015 Reitox week (23–27 November) unites over 40 nations including: the current 30 members of the network, Russia and a number of beneficiary countries of the European Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) and the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument (ENPI) (3). The Reitox week encompasses three events: international cooperation project-related meetings; the regular Heads of focal point meeting and a Reitox ‘extended network’ meeting (4), this year focusing on ‘Women and drugs’ (24 November). Experts and researchers from France, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Norway and the Lebanon will explore in this session the implications of gender for drug use, drug treatment, harm reduction and service planning. ‘Once countries join the EU, they are automatically required to participate in the work of the EU agencies’, says Wolfgang Götz, EMCDDA Director. ‘This is why aspiring EU members are encouraged to play an active role in the work of the agencies before entering the Union to ensure that, on accession, they are fully operational in the specific field. Participation in events such as Reitox week can help these countries strengthen their national information systems and gain access to tools and expertise to implement their own national strategies and responses to the drugs problem’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/fs10/reitox-week-2015_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0297	2015-11-04	UNK	EU drugs agency boosts cooperation with Georgian Ministry of Justice	 EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz and the Georgian Minister of Justice Tea Tsulukiani are meeting in Tbilisi today to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The agreement, between the agency and the Ministry of Justice, will boost cooperation between the two bodies in monitoring the drugs problem and facilitate the collection, processing and dissemination of information (1). Georgia — a country of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) area — submitted a formal request for cooperation with the EMCDDA in 2014. This led to a green light from the EMCDDA Management Board in December 2014 for the agreement to be negotiated and, in September 2015, for it to be signed. Today’s accord — signed for an initial period of five years — will be implemented through a joint work programme to be updated every three years. The programme will include steps to enhance the partners’ monitoring and knowledge base on the drug situation and responses to it, particularly through harmonising key indicators in areas of supply and demand. Special attention will be given to the regular exchange of information on the emergence and use of new psychotropic substances, as well as the technologies employed in their production. The MoU provides for the: exchange of technical expertise and knowledge between the two institutions; co-sponsoring of technical meetings; and pooling of human and financial resources to launch joint programmes. The Ministry of Justice will endeavour to present to the EMCDDA an annual report on the drug situation in Georgia, while the agency will facilitate training and the exchange of experts and research findings on issues of mutual interest. The two organisations recognise that information on the drug phenomenon is an essential and indispensable instrument for drafting and implementing drug policies and for assessing the impact of actions to reduce problems originating from drug use and trafficking. This agreement takes place within the EMCDDA’s mandate for cooperation with third (non-EU) countries in consultation with its Management Board and the European Commission (2). It is the fifth MoU to be signed with a country of the European Neighbourhood Policy area: agreements already exist with Armenia, Israel, Moldova and Ukraine. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/fs9/georgian-memorandum-of-understanding_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0298	2015-10-20	UNK	4,4'-DMAR and MT-45 to be placed under control across the EU	 Europe has responded to rising concerns over the use of two new drugs by subjecting them to ‘control measures and criminal penalties’ throughout the Union. The implementing decision of the Council of the EU (1), published in the Official Journal of the European Union today, was adopted in the final stage of the three-step legal procedure designed to respond to potentially threatening new psychoactive substances (NPS) available on the market (2). The two new substances — 4,4'-DMAR and MT-45 — have been raising health concerns in Europe after harmful effects related to them were reported by the Member States through the EU Early Warning System (EWS). The decision is based on the findings of formal risk assessments on the two substances, conducted by the extended EMCDDA Scientific Committee, with participation of additional experts from the EU Member States, European Commission, Europol and the European Medicines Agency. The risk assessment reports assessed the health and social risks of the drugs, as well as international trafficking and the involvement of organised crime (3). 4,4'-DMAR is a derivative of aminorex, has psychostimulant properties, and is reported to have been available on the drug market since at least December 2012. MT-45, a synthetic opioid investigated in the 1970s for its analgesic properties, was detected for the first time on the European drug market in October 2013. At the time of the risk assessments, a total of 31 and 28 deaths had been associated with these drugs respectively, and, in all cases, the presence of the substance in biological samples was analytically confirmed. The Council implementing decision states that the evidence available for each substance provides ‘sufficient grounds’ for subjecting it to control measures across the Union. Reasons for the conclusion include: the health risks posed by use of the drugs and their lack of medical value. At the time of the risk assessments, three Member States (DK, FI, SI) and one Member State (SE) had controlled 4,4'-DMAR and MT-45 respectively under national drug control legislation. As a result of today’s decision, all EU Member States are called upon to introduce control measures and criminal penalties within one year. This will facilitate cross-border law enforcement and judicial cooperation and protect from the risks posed by the availability and use of these substances. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz welcomed the news: ‘Today’s decision to introduce controls on 4,4’-DMAR and MT-45 is another positive example of the EU’s ability to respond to harms posed by new psychoactive substances. Both substances had been available for only short period of time before the EWS undertook the first action to respond to emerging health concerns posed by them. The EMCDDA is a world leader in the collection, exchange and analysis of information on new drugs, but more investment is needed to develop greater capacity to assess the health implications of the wide variety of new substances now becoming available.’ 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/9/44-dmar-and-mt-45_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0299	2015-10-09	UNK	EMCDDA co-hosts ‘Testing the waters 2015’	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) is co-hosting next week in Ascona, Switzerland, the second international conference on wastewater analysis: ‘Testing the waters 2015’. The event, to be held from 11–15 October, is organised by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), in association with the EU-funded SEWPROF project and the Europe-wide sewage analysis CORE group, SCORE. It also counts on generous support from the Centro Stefano Franscini (CSF/ETHZ). The conference follows on from Testing the waters I, organised by the EMCDDA in Lisbon in 2013. Wastewater analysis is a rapidly developing and novel scientific discipline with the potential for monitoring near-real-time, population-level trends in illicit drug use. By sampling a known source of wastewater, such as a sewage influent to a wastewater treatment plant, scientists can now estimate the quantity of drugs used in a community by measuring the levels of illicit drugs and their metabolites excreted in urine. While wastewater analysis does not provide the type of individual consumption data currently yielded by drug surveys, its ability to pinpoint total consumption rates in a given population makes it a useful complement to existing methods for studying drug use trends. Over 80 participants from some 20 countries will attend the conference and explore the following areas: Monitoring studies: targeted sampling at local, regional, national and international scale; integrating wastewater results with other epidemiological data Methodological improvements: quantifying and reducing uncertainty of back-calculation, monitoring design and in-sewer transformation Advances in analytical chemistry: method refinements and ability to measure new substances Ethical and legal aspects: discussion of settings requiring special attention Innovative applications: wastewater analysis for community-wide health assessment beyond illicit drugs The conference will hear presentations on the latest research findings and technical advances in the field and identify information gaps and future research needs. The EMCDDA, which sits on the organising and scientific committee of the conference, will describe its work in this domain and preview its upcoming publication Assessing illicit drugs in wastewater (1) to be released this autumn. It will also present an award for the best poster at the event. Research into wastewater analysis is of increasing interest worldwide and a trans-disciplinary approach is essential for its development. For this reason, the conference will combine the varied perspectives of: analytical chemistry, biochemistry, environmental and sewage engineering, forensic science, pharmacokinetics, spatial epidemiology, statistics and drug epidemiology. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/testing-the-waters-2015_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0300	2015-09-28	UNK	Minimum quality standards for drug demand reduction interventions in the EU	 On 14 September 2015, the Council of the European Union adopted Council conclusions on the implementation of minimum quality standards in drug demand reduction in the EU. This innovative initiative lists 16 standards that represent a minimum benchmark of quality for interventions in: drug use prevention, risk and harm reduction, treatment, social integration and rehabilitation. Although non-binding for national governments, this document represents the political will of EU countries to address demand reduction interventions through an evidence-based perspective. These guidelines have been drawn up in the context of Action 9 of the EU action plan on drugs (2013–16). The EMCDDA is disseminating the standards via its Best practice portal and will monitor their implementation. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/eu-minimum-quality-standards_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0301	2015-09-23	UNK	Speech by Wolfgang Götz, EMCDDA Director at the Lisbon Addictions Conference 2015	 Dear Secretary of State for Health, Dear Director General of SICAD, Dear Representative from the European Commission, Dear Colleagues and participants, It is a great pleasure for me to be here today and to say a few words at the opening of Lisbon Addictions 2015, the First European conference on addictive behaviours and dependencies. Lisbon Addictions 2015 is clearly a milestone for the European and international scientific community working on substance use and addiction. In Europe, this is the first time such a large multidisciplinary and cross-cutting event has been organised in this field ...and the EMCDDA is very proud to have had an active role in its conception, planning and [now its] delivery. To promote the sharing of research findings that can inform policy discussions and support effective responses is at the very core of our mission at the EMCDDA. For this reason, over the past 20 years, we have been progressively strengthening our relationship with the European and international research community. I am well aware of the hard work that the organising committee has put into this conference over the past year in order to bring you innovative, state-of-the-art research, opportunities for networking and options for forging partnerships and synergies... The EMCDDA’s contribution to this event fits with our commitment to providing practitioners and policymakers with evidence-based information. As most of you are certainly aware, this year the EMCDDA is commemorating 20 years of monitoring the drugs problem in Europe. And we wanted to derive maximum benefit from having so many experts in Lisbon for this conference to create synergies with our more regular EMCDDA business. Earlier this week we organised the EMCDDA conference: 20 years of monitoring and communicating evidence on drugs. The purpose of that conference was to review the achievements of our first 20 years of work, as well as to reflect on how to further continue producing robust and up-to-date information for decision-making. We also decided to organise the ceremony for the EMCDDA Scientific paper award — now in its 5thconsecutive year — to coincide with Lisbon Addictions 2015. With this award, the EMCDDA celebrates scientific writing and acknowledges high-quality research in the field of illicit drugs. This year we distinguish five papers published in peer-reviewed journals in 2014. They cover the research areas of basic biology, epidemiology, demand reduction, drug policy and drug supply. Our award ceremony will take place during the opening reception at 18.30 today. I would be delighted to see you all there. Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to finish by thanking the main organisers of the event — the Portuguese General-Directorate for Intervention on Addictive Behaviours and Dependencies, the journal Addiction, and the International Society of Addiction Journal Editors (ISAJE) — for giving us the opportunity to embark on such an inspiring challenge and for the excellent collaboration that we have enjoyed over the last year. I have no doubts that Lisbon Addictions will become a major regular event in the substance use and addictions field. At the EMCDDA we look forward to contributing again to this joint endeavour ... and we believe this enthusiasm is shared by all our partners on the organising committee. On a more personal note, I would like to mention that this is my last major conference as EMCDDA Director. It has been (and still is) a privilege for me to serve this agency and its stakeholders for more than 10 years, and it is with a great sense of accomplishment that I will hand over to Alexis Goosdeel the position of EMCDDA Director from 1 January 2016. I have been working closely with Alexis for more than 16 years and this is now the second time he becomes my successor... So when I tell you that the EMCDDA and you — the stakeholders — will be in very good hands, you understand that this doesn’t come out of the blue. Thank you very much for your attention. I wish you a fruitful meeting and pleasant stay in Lisbon. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/speeches/wolfgang-goetz-opening-lisbon-addictions-2015_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0303	2015-09-18	UNK	EMCDDA conference: 20 years of monitoring and communicating evidence on drugs	 Venue: Conference Centre, Praça Europa 4, Cais do Sodré, 1249-206, Lisbon Understanding the dynamics, nature and scale of drug use in Europe, including lessons learnt and challenges for the future, will be the thrust of an EMCDDA technical conference being held in Lisbon from 21–22 September (1). The event, organised ahead of Lisbon Addictions 2015 (2), commemorates the EU agency’s 20 years of monitoring and communicating evidence on drugs (3). Building on national and early European-level activities, the EMCDDA has worked for the last two decades to establish and develop mechanisms to monitor Europe’s drug problems. At the heart of its activity have been efforts to enhance the comparability of drug information across Europe and to devise the standards, methods and tools required to achieve this. Among the agency’s core achievements are its five key epidemiological indicators (KI), supported by EMCDDA expert groups, which allow countries to describe in a ‘common language’ the extent and nature of drug use and its consequences (4). This event will bring together over 180 experts from across the globe including representatives of: the EMCDDA KI expert networks; the Reitox focal points; and other technical domains covered by the agency. The event will further the agency’s ongoing efforts to inspire cross-discipline, multi-indicator analyses of the drugs problem and the sharing of perspectives from different technical domains. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘Over the years, the EMCDDA has supported the development of Europe-wide surveillance systems to carry out regular and sustained monitoring of developments in the drugs field, as well as early-warning mechanisms to ensure rapid responses to new substances. It is an imposing feat that the fledgling monitoring instruments established 20 years ago have now matured into a comprehensive European system recognised worldwide’. A packed two-day agenda will feature over 70 interventions, eight sessions and 11 workshops. Issues covered will include: maximising the value of information collected; incorporating new tools and topics; and ensuring that the European drug monitoring system remains fit for purpose in the face of new challenges. The final workshop will focus on ‘Making monitoring data speak louder to policy and more clearly to inform best practice’. The conference aims to reflect on past successes but also to be forward-looking. Key issues to help the EMCDDA better achieve its aims include: increased data quality and comparability; improved timeliness; better identification of emerging trends; faster and more sensitive monitoring approaches; and the integration of traditional and new monitoring methods (e.g. wastewater analysis, internet surveys). The ultimate aim of this milestone event will be to contribute to reducing drug-related harms through better informed and faster evaluated policies. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/nr7/20-years-of-monitoring-conference_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0304	2015-09-10	UNK	EMCDDA Management Board selects new Director	 Alexis Goosdeel (Belgium) was selected today to become the new Director of the Lisbon-based European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). Following a public recruitment procedure, the agency’s Management Board, meeting in Lisbon this week, interviewed three candidates short-listed for the post in July by the European Commission. Mr Goosdeel was elected by over a two-thirds majority by secret ballot. Before being formally appointed by the Board, Mr Goosdeel will be required to make a statement before the European Parliament later this month and to answer questions put by members of the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Committee (LIBE). Fifty-five-year-old Mr Goosdeel is expected to take up the post on 1 January 2016. He will succeed Wolfgang Götz (Germany), who has headed the agency since 1 May 2005 and who will remain Director until the end of the year. Mr Goosdeel joined the EMCDDA in 1999 as a project manager working in the area of EU enlargement and international cooperation. Since 2005, he has been Head of the agency’s Reitox and international relations unit. In this capacity, he has played a central role in: coordinating a network of 30 national drug monitoring centres; preparing EU candidate and potential candidate countries for membership of the EMCDDA; preparing future cooperation with neighbouring countries to the EU; and nurturing relations with countries beyond the Union (Central Asia, Russia, Latin America). He has spent much of his 30-year career working in the field of public health at national, European and international level. He was one of the founders of Modus Vivendi, a Belgian NGO working in the area of harm reduction. Before joining the agency, Mr Goosdeel directed the Brussels-based Alizés, a European association working for development and cooperation in public health (1992–99).  Mr Goosdeel holds a Master’s degree in clinical psychology and a special diploma in advanced management. He is proficient in six languages: French (mother tongue); English, Spanish, Greek, Portuguese and Dutch. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/6/new-director_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0305	2015-09-08	UNK	EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz receives award for services to the Republic of Austria	 EMCDDA Wolfgang Götz will be guest of honour at the Austrian Embassy in Lisbon this evening where he will be awarded the Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold for Services to the Republic of Austria (1). The award will be bestowed on Mr Götz by His Excellency the Ambassador of Austria Thomas Stelzer (2), on behalf of the President of the Federal Republic of Austria, Dr Heinz Fischer. Austria honours both Austrian and foreign leading figures who have been of special service to the country. The law establishing the Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria was enacted in 1952 by the country’s National Assembly. The Federal President confers these honours on receipt of a proposal from an appropriate member of the Federal Government, the President of the National Assembly or the President of the Federal Council. Mr Götz was nominated for the accolade by Austrian National Drug Coordinator Franz Pietsch, who is also Deputy Director-General of Public Health at the Austrian Federal Ministry of Health. Mr Pietsch — who sits on the EMCDDA Management Board — nominated Mr Götz for the award in appreciation of his accomplishments in the drugs field, in general, and in Austria, in particular, and the sound relations he has forged with the country. Wolfgang Götz has been Director of the EMCDDA since May 2005, having been appointed by the agency’s Management Board in April that year. In July 2009, the Board renewed his mandate unanimously for a further five-year term commencing on 1 May 2010. During his mandate, Mr Götz has paid special attention to enhancing the scientific quality and efficiency of the agency’s work and to providing policymakers with evidence-based information for a more informed and reasoned debate on the drugs problem. A German civil servant and economist, Mr Götz has been seconded to international organisations since 1985. He has spent most of his successful career managing international projects and teams in the area of collecting, analysing and managing statistics and other information key to policy-making and implementation. Mr Götz was born in Freiburg on 17 November 1951. In May this year, Mr Götz’s mandate was extended until the end of the year, pending the arrival of his successor in 2016 (3). The EMCDDA Management Board will hold elections this week to select a new candidate for the post. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/fs7/austrian-grand-decoration-of-honour-for-emcdda-director_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0306	2015-09-02	UNK	EMCDDA celebrates 20 years of monitoring	 This year, the EMCDDA commemorates 20 years of monitoring the drugs problem in Europe. Over the last two decades, much has changed in the extent and nature of the phenomenon. In 1995, when the agency embarked on its mission (1), the EU was in the midst of a heroin epidemic, with drug policy largely driven by HIV transmission and AIDS-related and overdose deaths. In 2015, the policy drivers have diversified and the complexity of the drugs problem has increased, with many of the substances monitored today virtually unknown when the agency was first established. As we reflect on the achievements of our first 20 years, we also reflect on our deeper and broader understanding of Europe’s drug situation and responses to it. Today, the agency can talk with confidence on drug problems evolving across the Union and can inform policy discussions and effective responses at national, regional and local level. Over the years, the EMCDDA has supported the development of Europe-wide surveillance systems, to carry out regular and sustained monitoring of developments in the drugs field, as well as early-warning mechanisms to ensure rapid responses to new substances. It is an imposing feat that the fledgling monitoring instruments established 20 years ago have now matured into a comprehensive European system recognised worldwide. These successes have been dependent on close collaboration with our European, national and international partners, in particular the EU institutions and our Reitox network. At the heart of the EMCDDA’s work have been efforts to improve the comparability of drug information across Europe and to devise the standards, methods and tools required to achieve this. These include the agency’s five key indicators, allowing EU countries to describe in a ‘common language’ the extent and effects of drug use and its consequences. To deepen insight and increase the timeliness of information, the agency has broadened its repertoire of monitoring methods in recent years by employing internet monitoring, wastewater analysis and trendspotter methodology to assess new trends and patterns of use. In the first half of this year, the agency released its 20th annual overview of the drugs problem in its European Drug Report 2015: Trends and Developments. Later this month, the 20-year theme will again be taken up at a technical conference where EMCDDA expert groups will explore the dynamics, nature and scale of drug use in Europe and reflect on future priorities (2). Over the past two decades, European drug policy has gradually become more evidence based. A central challenge for the EMCDDA today is to continue to deliver high-quality analyses on established topics while, at the same time, extending its work in less developed but strategically important areas, in a limited-resource environment. As drug-related threats develop, our monitoring systems must evolve to keep pace with these changes and produce robust information for decision-making.

EMCDDA_UNK_0307	2015-07-28	UNK	EU drugs agency steps up cooperation with National Security Council of Armenia	 The European Union and Armenia will cooperate more actively on monitoring the drug phenomenon in future, thanks to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed today in Yerevan between the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the National Security Council of Armenia (NSC). The agreement was signed by EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz and NSC Chief of staff, Aram Tananyan. Armenia — a country of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) area — submitted a formal request for cooperation with the EMCDDA in 2013 (1). This led to a green light from the EMCDDA Management Board in July that year for the agency to negotiate the MoU with the NSC.  EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz and NSC Chief of staff, Aram Tananyan Today’s accord — signed for an initial period of five years and sealing cooperation between the two partners — will be implemented through a joint work programme to be updated every three years. This programme will include steps to enhance the partners’ monitoring and knowledge base on the drug situation and responses to it, particularly through harmonising key indicators in areas of both supply and demand.  Special attention will be given to the regular exchange of information on the appearance on the drug market and use of new psychotropic substances, as well as the technologies employed in their production.  The agreement provides for an exchange of technical expertise and knowledge between the two bodies, the co-sponsoring of technical meetings and the pooling of human and financial resources to launch joint programmes. The NSC will endeavour to present to the EMCDDA an annual report on the drug situation in Armenia. The EMCDDA, for its part, will facilitate training as well as the exchange of experts and scientific research findings on issues of mutual interest.  Both organisations recognise that information on the drugs phenomenon is an essential and indispensable instrument for drafting and implementing drug policies and for assessing the impact of actions to reduce the problems originating from drug use and trafficking.  This cooperation takes place within the EMCDDA’s mandate for cooperation with third (non-EU) countries in consultation with its Management Board and the European Commission (2).  The European Union and Armenia will cooperate more actively on monitoring the drug phenomenon in future, thanks to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed today in Yerevan between the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the National Security Council of Armenia (NSC).

The event, marking International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking, takes the form of an official ceremony at the Palace of the Presidency of the Republic of Cyprus in the presence of Dr Philippos Patsalis, Minister of Health — representing the President of the Republic of Cyprus — and Dr Chrysanthos Georgiou, Chair of the Cyprus Antidrug Council. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/award-from-cyprus-antidrug-council_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0309	2015-06-25	UNK	EMCDDA: Europe's cities offer valuable observation window on new drug trends	 Drug problems often emerge, and are most acutely felt, in urban environments, making Europe’s cities a valuable observation window on new drug trends. In its latest report — released today ahead of International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking (26 June) — the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) looks at drugs in cities across Europe, revealing how some cities are developing drug strategies of their own (1). The European Union is one of the most urbanised areas in the world and its cities are set to become more densely populated. Currently 73 % of the EU’s population resides in cities and this is projected to increase to 82 % (or 30 million new residents) by 2050 (2). The new EMCDDA analysis, Drugs policy and the city in Europe, shows how modern cities play host to a diverse set of drug using populations and related health, social and security problems. The report identifies 10 European capitals with a dedicated drug strategy: Berlin, Bucharest, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Lisbon, Madrid, Prague, Stockholm, Vienna and Warsaw (Figure 2). EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘As European cities expand and change, we see the drug problems found in them also evolving. It is within cities that new problems first become visible and we increasingly see innovative policies and measures developing. I believe there is considerable scope for European cities to share their experiences and to learn from each other in this challenging policy area.’ The report, which looks at established and emerging drug problems, focuses on four topics: urban spaces and drug use; businesses and recreational drug use; city-level drug policies; and coordinating and funding city-level policies. Urban spaces and drug use: Eight capital cities report current ‘open drug scenes’ (Figure 1), which can vary from the ‘concentrated’ (up to hundreds of users per day) to the ‘dispersed’ (multiple smaller gatherings), with many fluctuating from one type to the other. Despite these variations, common features exist, namely: the presence of polydrug use (often involving heroin, prescription medications and alcohol); health issues linked to injecting (infection with HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses, discarded injecting materials); and problems relating to congregations of users (criminality, public nuisance). The report explores some of the responses currently used, including: needle- and syringe-exchange programmes; drop-in centres; drug consumption rooms (3); and measures to reduce drug-related litter (e.g. sharp bins, needle-exchange machines). Businesses and recreational drug use: Cities contain a high density of premises where psychoactive substances are sold and consumed. Frequently, specific areas exist where many of these businesses are clustered together. This can give rise to zones where drug use and intoxication are tolerated, if not accepted. Given the diversity of the drug problems found in such areas, a spectrum of responses is being implemented. These range from prevention and harm-reduction initiatives in recreational settings (e.g. information campaigns, pill-testing) to legislative measures targeting new psychoactive substances and street-based outlets for their sale. City-level drug policies: The report defines city-level policies as ‘measures taken by local policy actors to address all or some aspects of drug problems in a specific urban location’. It finds that city-level drug strategies frequently mirror the focus of national and regional level documents (Berlin, Helsinki, Lisbon, Madrid, Stockholm, Vienna, Warsaw). Other cities, however, adopt a more thematic approach, addressing specific issues such as: open drug scenes (Copenhagen, Oslo); antisocial behaviour (Dublin) and crack cocaine (London, Paris). Elsewhere (Brussels, Riga, Vilnius), drug issues are included in other city-level strategic documents, such as those focusing on crime or public health. Dedicated local drug monitoring systems exist in some cities, while others use ad hoc methods to monitor drug use. Coordinating and funding city-level policies: The paper looks at some of the drug coordination arrangements found in European cities. Generally, city authorities are formally responsible for the coordination of city-level drug policy, in some cases, this being established by law (Helsinki, Madrid, Warsaw). Some cities have dedicated drug policy units (Helsinki, Madrid, Paris, Prague, Stockholm, Vienna), while others address drug issues via generic policy units (e.g. London). Officially appointed ‘city drug coordinators’ exist in some capitals (Berlin, Prague, Vienna and Warsaw). Where no formal coordination structures exist at city level, national-, regional- or local-level structures are responsible for strategy implementation (Ankara, Bratislava, Bucharest, Dublin). A number of Europe’s capitals have dedicated drug strategy budgets that fund entire agencies or services provided by agencies. The available expenditure figures range from EUR 6.5 million in Berlin to EUR 29.4 million in Madrid in 2011. Concluding, Wolfgang Götz says: ‘Today, data on drug use at city level are gathered from a variety of sources, with new information emerging from frontline services, hospital emergency departments and wastewater analysis networks. This allows us to gain a more up-to-date view of the state of drug problems at this level and to evaluate the effectiveness of drug policies and responses’(4). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/5/international-drugs-day_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0310	2015-06-09	UNK	Annual meeting of the Reitox Early Warning System network	 The latest developments in monitoring and responding to new psychoactive substances (NPS/'new drugs') were discussed at the 15th annual meeting of the Reitox Early Warning System (EWS) network, held in Lisbon from 8–9 June. The meeting opened with a summary of the findings of the 2014 EMCDDA–Europol report on the implementation of Council Decision 2005/87/JHA. The report highlights that the growth of the market in new psychoactive substances will continue to pose challenges for public health and drug policy over the next few years, particularly relating to the speed at which NPS appear (two substances every week), their open sale, and the lack of information on their effects and harms. Europol, the European Medicines Agency, the European Commission as well as the national EWS representatives provided updates on the NPS phenomenon. The UNODC provided an international perspective, highlighting the need to react to NPS at global level when necessary, in proportion to their risk to health and market availability. Three sessions followed on issues of topical relevance. The ‘European NPS market’ session examined the complex, dynamic nature of the NPS market and the increasing connection with the illicit drugs market. ‘Toxicovigilance: identifying, understanding and responding to serious adverse events’ explored the role of poison centres in spotting emerging problems with NPS and included a discussion of some potent new fentanyls recently emerging in the EU and representing cause for some concern. The final session was dedicated to ‘Public health alerts’, with the Netherlands, Slovenia and Sweden presenting their national systems for handling these. A discussion followed on how this key element of the EWS can be developed to assist the Member States in responding to rapidly emerging problems associated with NPS. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/early-warning-system-meeting_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0311	2015-06-04	UNK	EMCDDA explores new dynamics and dimensions of Europe’s drugs problem	 Changing dynamics in the heroin market, the latest implications of cannabis use and new features and dimensions of the stimulant and ‘new drugs’ scene, are among the issues highlighted by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) today as it launches its European Drug Report 2015: Trends and Developments in Lisbon (1). In its annual review, the agency reflects on 20 years of monitoring and examines the global influences and local ramifications of Europe’s ever-changing drugs problem. Dimitris Avramopoulos, European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, says: ‘The report shows that we are confronted with a rapidly changing, globalised drug market and, therefore, we need to be united, swift and determined in our response to the drugs threat. I am particularly concerned that the Internet is increasingly becoming a new source of supply, for both controlled and uncontrolled psychoactive substances’. Commissioner Avramopoulos continues: ‘Europe plays a leading role in tackling the “new drugs” phenomenon and we will continue to do so for the wellbeing and safety of our citizens. 101 new uncontrolled psychoactive substances were reported in 2014, challenging our existing control mechanisms. I look forward to the forthcoming EU legislation in this area, which is currently under negotiation. This will further strengthen our responses and equip us with better instruments to deal with these substances more rapidly and more effectively’. Heroin in decline, but market changes call for close monitoring Problems relating to heroin still account for a large share of the drug-related health and social costs in Europe, but recent trends in this area have been ‘relatively positive’, says the EMCDDA, noting an ‘overall stagnation in demand for this drug’. Fewer people are now entering specialised drug treatment for the first time for heroin problems: 23 000 in 2013 compared to 59 000 in 2007. And it is estimated that over half (700 000) of Europe’s 1.3 million problem opioid users (i.e. long-duration, dependent users) are now in opioid substitution treatment (Figure 3.6). Figure 3.6: Trends in number of clients in opioid substitution treatment   Reported seizures data, which help understand trends in heroin supply, also show declines. The quantity of heroin seized in the EU in 2013 (5.6 tonnes) was among the lowest reported in the last 10 years — half the amount seized in 2002 (10 tonnes). The number of heroin seizures also fell from around 45 000 in 2002 to 32 000 in 2013 (Figure 1.6). But against this positive backdrop, the EMCDDA flags up a number of market changes which call for close monitoring. Figure 1.6: Number of heroin seizures and quantity seized   Latest UN estimates (2), for example, suggest a substantial increase in opium production in Afghanistan in 2013 and 2014, the country supplying most of the heroin used in Europe. A potential knock-on effect of this could be greater availability of heroin on the European market. Also highlighted are signs of market innovation, including the detection inside Europe of heroin processing laboratories, the first time since the 1970s. Two laboratories, converting morphine into heroin, were discovered in Spain in 2013 and 2014. Changes in heroin trafficking into Europe are also noted. While the traditional ‘Balkan route’ remains prominent, there are signs that the ‘Southern route’ is gaining ground. (This originates in Iran and Pakistan and reaches Europe directly or indirectly via countries in the Arabian Peninsula and east, southern and west Africa). A new analysis released today on opioid trafficking from Asia to Europe points to a diversification in the products traded (e.g. morphine base and opium, in addition to heroin) and in the means of transport and routes used (see ‘Perspectives on Drugs’/POD). Commenting today, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘Changes in law enforcement activity, instability and armed conflict, and the multiple and rapid connections brought by globalisation, are among a variety of factors that can alter trafficking routes. Today, we see marked increases in opium production in Afghanistan and a diversification both in products traded and in trafficking methods and routes used. This is compounded by the fact that crucial stages of the heroin manufacturing process are now being carried out inside Europe. Any potential for a resurgence of heroin problems is worrying and close monitoring of the situation is critical’. In addition to heroin, other opioids seized by law enforcement agencies in European countries in 2013 included: opium; crude opium preparations (e.g. ‘Kompot’); medicinal products (morphine, methadone, buprenorphine, fentanyl and tramadol); as well as novel synthetic opioids. Older opioid users in need of tailored services Opioid dependence is often a chronic condition, and providing appropriate treatment and care to long-term opioid users is a growing challenge for drug treatment and social services today. The report shows how the average age of those entering treatment for opioid problems is increasing, with the median age rising by five years between 2006 and 2013 (Figure 2.11). A significant number of opioid users in Europe with long-term polydrug use histories are now in their 40s and 50s. A history of poor physical and mental health, bad living conditions, infections and the misuse of multiple substances (including alcohol and tobacco), makes this group susceptible to a range of chronic health problems (e.g. cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic). Figure 2.11: Trends in age structure of clients entering treatment by primary drug     ‘Clinical guidelines that take account of the demographic shift in Europe’s problem opioid users are needed’, says the report. These would support effective clinical practice and cover issues such as: drug interactions; take-home dosages of substitution treatment medications (e.g. methadone, buprenorphine); managing pain and treating infections. Few countries report the availability of targeted programmes for older drug users. This group is generally integrated within existing drug treatment services (Figure 3.10). Figure 3.10: Availability of targeted programmes for older drug users (expert ratings, 2013)   The Netherlands is one of a few countries where retirement homes have been set up to cater for the needs of older drug users. Hepatitis C treatments improve and new HIV diagnoses stall Transmitted through the sharing of needles, syringes and other injecting equipment, hepatitis C is the most common infectious disease among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Europe, with national samples of PWIDs showing between 14 % and 84 % infected with the hepatitis C virus in the period 2012–13 (Figure 2.14). Hepatitis C infection is often asymptomatic and can go for decades undiagnosed. Many of those infected go on to develop chronic hepatitis and are at risk of developing liver disease (e.g. cirrhosis, cancer). Figure 2.14: HCV antibody prevalence among injecting drug users, 2012/2013   A growing number of countries have adopted, or are preparing, specific hepatitis C strategies, which aim in particular to ensure access to hepatitis C testing. While new antiviral medications are available — which stop the disease progressing or allow full recovery — lack of diagnosis, together with high medication costs, are limiting the reach of these new treatments. Latest data show that rises in the number of new HIV diagnoses attributed to injecting in Europe, resulting from outbreaks in Greece and Romania in 2011/12, have now stalled and that the overall EU total has dropped to pre-outbreak levels (Figure 2.13). Figure 2.13: Newly diagnosed HIV cases related to injecting drug use     Provisional figures for 2013 show 1 458 newly reported HIV infections, compared with 1 974 in 2012, reversing the upward trend since 2010. Despite progress in this area, the EMCDDA underlines the need for continued vigilance and adequate service provision. Tackling drug overdoses — a challenge for public health policy Reducing fatal drug overdoses and other drug-related deaths (e.g. drug-related diseases, accidents and suicide) remains an important challenge for public health policy today. It is estimated that at least 6 100 overdose deaths occurred in the EU in 2013, mainly related to heroin and other opioids. A new analysis accompanying today’s report places the spotlight on benzodiazepine misuse among high-risk opioid users, who may take these medicines to self-medicate or to enhance the effects of opioids (see POD). The analysis shows how the combined use of opioids with benzodiazepines and other central nervous system depressants (e.g. alcohol) contributes to an increased risk of overdose deaths. Prescrib-ing and clinical practice guidelines could play a key role in the management of this complex issue. Interventions aimed at preventing overdoses encompass targeted strategies, risk education and overdose response training, including the distribution of take-home naloxone (3). Some countries also have a long-established practice of providing ‘drug consumption rooms’ (DCRs). Six EMCDDA reporting countries currently provide these services, totalling around 70 facilities (Denmark, Germany, Spain, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway), while France recently approved the experimental trial of DCRs. A review of services delivered in these settings accompanies this year’s analysis (see POD) and shows how DCRs provide a ‘local response’ to ‘local problems’. Among others, DCRs can play a role in reducing drug-related harms (including overdose deaths) and serve as useful spaces to connect hard-to-reach drug users with health services. Growing importance of cannabis within drug treatment systems in Europe Cannabis remains the most widely consumed illicit drug in Europe, with an estimated 19.3 million adults (15–64 years) reporting to have used it in the last year, of these 14.6 million being young adults (15–34 years). It is estimated that around 1 % of all adults are daily or almost daily users. Population surveys for three countries (Germany, Spain and the UK), report decreasing or stable cannabis prevalence over the past decade. In contrast, rising use is observed in Bulgaria, France and four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway). Taken as a whole, the most recent survey results show divergent trends in last-year cannabis use among young adults (Figure 2.1). Figure 2.1: Last year prevalence of cannabis use among young adults (15–34)   The drug’s high prevalence is reflected in the numbers entering specialised drug treatment, with the largest group of first-time treatment entrants now citing cannabis as their main problem drug. The overall number of those entering treatment for the first time for cannabis problems in Europe rose from 45 000 in 2006 to 61 000 in 2013. While cannabis clients entering treatment are most likely to self-refer (34 %), the analysis notes that around one-quarter of all those entering treatment for primary cannabis use (23 000) were referrals from the criminal justice system. Evidence supports the use of psychosocial interventions in treating drug use problems and these are widely used in treating problems relating to cannabis. These approaches are explored today in an analysis accompanying the report (see POD) and in a recent EMCDDA Insights publication (4). Acute cannabis-related emergencies, although rare, can occur after consuming the substance, especially at high doses (see purity section below). A recent study, conducted in emergency settings, showed an increase in the numbers of cannabis-related emergencies reported between 2008 and 2012 in 11 of the 13 European countries analysed. Today’s report highlights the major role played by cannabis in drug-related crime statistics with the drug accounting for 80 % of the number of seizures, and with cannabis use or possession for personal use accounting for over 60 % of all reported drug law offences in Europe (see Figure 1). The number of seizures of herbal cannabis overtook that of cannabis resin in Europe in 2009, and the gap has continued to widen (Figure 1.3). In 2013, of the 671 000 cannabis seizures reported in the EU, 431 000 were of herbal cannabis (marijuana) and 240 000 of cannabis resin (hashish). This trend is driven, to a large extent, by the increased availability of domestically produced herbal cannabis inside Europe and is mirrored in increasing seizures of cannabis plants. The quantity of cannabis resin seized in the EU is still much higher than that of herbal cannabis (460 tonnes versus 130 tonnes). Figure 1.3: Trends in number of cannabis seizures and quantity seized Resin, number of seizures   Resin, quantity seized (kilograms)   Herb, number of seizures   Herb, quantity seized (kilograms)   Over 130 synthetic cannabinoids, sold as legal replacements for cannabis, have been detected to date by the EU Early Warning System (EWS), adding a new dimension to the cannabis market. The use of these substances can result in adverse health consequences (e.g. kidney damage, pulmonary and cardiovascular effects, convulsions). Recent deaths and acute intoxications in Europe, and internationally, linked to these substances have prompted the EMCDDA to issue public health-related alerts. Competition in a crowded stimulant market Europe is confronted with a crowded stimulant market, with cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy and a growing number of synthetic drugs targeting similar consumer groups. Cocaine remains the most commonly used illicit stimulant drug in Europe, although most users are found in a small number of western EU countries. Around 3.4 million adults (15–64 years) have used cocaine in the last year, of these 2.3 million being young adults (15–34 years). Only a few countries report last-year prevalence of cocaine use among young adults of more than 3 % (Figure 2.4). Decreases in cocaine use are observable in the most recent data. Of the countries that have produced surveys since 2012, eight reported lower estimates and three reported higher estimates than in the previous comparable survey. Use of amphetamines (encompassing amphetamine and methamphetamine) remains overall lower than that of cocaine in Europe, with around 1.6 million adults reporting last-year use; of these 1.3 million being young adults (15–34 years) (Figure 2.5). New patterns in methamphetamine use are highlighted in today’s report. In the Czech Republic, for example, a marked increase in high-risk methamphetamine use (mainly injection) has been observed, with estimates of the number of users increasing from some 21 000 to over 34 000 between 2007 and 2013. Also reported in a number of European countries is the injection of methamphetamine with other stimulants (e.g. synthetic cathinones) among small groups of men who have sex with men. These so-called ‘slamming’ practices raise concern due to risk-taking in both drug-use and sexual behaviour. Figure 2.5: Last year prevalence of amphetamines use among young adults (15–34)   An estimated 2.1 million adults (15–64 years) have used ecstasy in the last year; 1.8 million being young adults (15–34 years) (Figure 2.6). After a period in which tablets sold as ecstasy had a reputation among consumers for poor quality and product adulteration, high-purity MDMA powder and tablets are now more commonly available (see purity section below). Figure 2.6: Last year prevalence of ecstasy use among young adults (15–34)   Figure 2.6: Last year prevalence of ecstasy use among young adults (15–34)   Synthetic cathinones (e.g. mephedrone, pentedrone and MDPV) are now a fixture on the illicit stimulant market in some European countries and are often used interchangeably with amphetamine and ecstasy. Injection of synthetic cathinones, although not widespread in Europe, is a worrying localised problem in groups of high-risk drug users in some countries. Rising treatment demand linked to use of these substances is reported in Hungary, Romania and the UK. Increases in drug potency and purity fuel concern A key finding in this year’s report is the marked rise in the potency and purity of Europe’s most commonly used illicit drugs, fuelling concerns for the health of users who, wittingly or unwittingly, may be consuming stronger products (Chapter 1). Overall trends for the period 2006–13 show the potency of cannabis (THC content), the purity of cocaine and the MDMA-content in ecstasy tablets to have risen in countries consistently reporting data; heroin purity also rose in 2013. Technical innovation and market competition are two of the likely factors driving the trend. Highlighted are concerns over ecstasy tablets with high levels of MDMA, often sold with distinctive shapes and logos. Over the last year, the EMCDDA and Europol have issued public health alerts on the risks of consuming such products. Alerts have also been issued regarding tablets sold as ecstasy but containing other harmful substances, such as PMMA, following a series of deaths. ‘New drugs’ detected at the rate of two per week New psychoactive substances (NPS or ‘new drugs’, often sold as ‘legal highs’) were detected in the EU last year at the rate of around two per week. A total of 101 new substances were reported to the EWS in 2014 (up from 81 substances in 2013), continuing an upward trend in substances notified in a single year (Figure 1.12). This brings the total number of substances being monitored by the agency to over 450, with more than half of that figure being identified in the last three years alone. Figure 1.12: Number and categories of new psychoactive substances notified to the EU Early Warning System   Figure 1.2: Number of seizures of new psychoactive substances reported to the EU Early Warning System   New studies and surveys are beginning to shed light on the use of NPS, with nine countries now incorporating NPS prevalence in their national drug surveys. In most EU countries, the prevalence of use of these substances appears to be low. However, even limited use of these substances can be a concern, due to the severe toxicity of some NPS. Health and social responses to NPS are gaining momentum and mirror the full range of responses to the more established drugs (e.g. drug education; Internet-based interventions; and needle and syringe exchange programmes). The Internet and apps: emerging virtual drug markets The Internet plays a growing role in supplying and marketing drugs to Europeans, with NPS and established drugs both offered for sale online. Use of the ‘surface web’ (accessible via common search engines) for the sale of NPS has received greater attention over the last decade, with EMCDDA monitoring identifying around 650 websites selling ‘legal highs’ to Europeans. A challenging development in the online market is the sale of illicit drugs on ‘cryptomarkets’ or ‘deep web’ online marketplaces (accessible via encryption software). These allow goods and services to be exchanged between parties anonymously, often using ‘crypto currencies’ (e.g. Bitcoin) to facilitate hidden transactions. So-called ‘grey marketplaces’ are also emerging, where sites operate on both the surface and deep web. The report highlights how social media and apps also play an active role in drug markets, whether used directly for buying and selling drugs or indirectly for marketing, opinion-forming or experience-sharing. ‘The growth of online and virtual drug markets pose major challenges to law enforcement and drug control policies’, says the report. ‘Existing regulatory models will need to be adapted to perform in a global and virtual context’. --- Chairman of the EMCDDA Management Board Joao Goulão concludes: ‘This 20th analysis of the European drug phenomenon demonstrates how much has changed since the EMCDDA’s first report in 1996, and how much the agency has enhanced understanding of this issue. The complexity of the drugs problem is now far greater, with many of the substances featured today virtually unknown to users two decades ago. The boundaries between old and new drugs are also becoming harder to define, as novel substances increasingly mimic controlled drugs. This annual window on Europe’s drugs problem provides a valuable basis for informing discussions on drug policy today. It also offers important insight for the policies we will need tomorrow’.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/4/new-dynamics-of-europes-drugs-problem_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0313	2015-04-21	UNK	EMCDDA underlines growing importance of effective treatment for cannabis use	 Providing effective treatment for those with cannabis use disorders is likely to become a matter of growing importance in European drug policy. This is according to the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) today as it launches a new in-depth study: Treatment of cannabis-related disorders in Europe. Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in Europe, with an estimated 18.1 million adults (15–64 years) reporting to have used it in the last year. Of these, 14.6 million are young adults (15–34), while some 3 million adults are daily or almost daily users (1). This is reflected in the numbers entering specialised drug treatment, with the largest group of first-time treatment entrants citing cannabis as their main problem drug.  Opening with an overview of cannabis use and its health effects, the report proceeds to: present the latest evidence underpinning interventions; map out the availability and provision of cannabis treatment in 30 countries (with examples of cannabis-specific programmes); and compare treatment needs with provision.  ‘Treatment for cannabis-related problems’, states the report, ‘relies primarily on psychosocial approaches combining elements of classical psychotherapy with social support and care’. To highlight the interventions most likely to succeed, the study weighs up the published evidence on a range of treatment programmes.  It differentiates between those targeting adults or adolescents and between cannabis-specific and general substance-use programmes. Telephone and online approaches are among those examined. Drawing on data from the EU Member States, Turkey and Norway, the report finds that many countries have implemented, expanded or modified national treatment programmes to better serve this population of drug users. It describes how most European countries now offer treatment programmes for cannabis use disorders (mostly via outpatient services). The study reveals that 15 countries declared providing at least one cannabis-specific treatment programme, while 14 other countries reported treating individuals with cannabis problems via general substance-use interventions.   No evidence was found for the superiority of specific over general treatment, as ‘both approaches can work’. Comparing indicators of treatment needs with treatment provision, the report concludes that, despite exceptions, ‘the overall situation in Europe looks positive’.  EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘In recent years, we have seen seismic shifts in the cannabis market, evolving patterns of use and a growing debate on cannabis controls, with the drug now high on the political agenda in many parts of the world. It is both timely and appropriate then that we address the treatment of cannabis use disorders today. With large numbers entering cannabis programmes every year in Europe, largely paid for by public funds, treatment effectiveness is a key consideration for policy. With this report we hope to offer experts and policymakers a firm basis for their decision-making.’   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/3/treatment-of-cannabis-related-disorders-in-Europe_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0315	2015-03-23	UNK	EMCDDA publishes first overview of the drug situation in the Western Balkans	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) publishes today its first overview of the drug situation in the Western Balkans (1). Focusing on Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo*, Montenegro and Serbia — all candidate and potential candidate countries to the European Union — the report describes a region facing a complex array of drug use problems and associated health and social consequences. It focuses specifically on problem drug use, drug-related deaths, the health effects of injecting and treatment and harm reduction responses. ‘This region is still all too often associated with the “Balkan route”, used by organised crime groups to smuggle illicit drugs, mainly heroin, from Central Asia to the European Union’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘But this restrictive view does not do justice to the progress made in addressing the local, and highly complex, drug situation’. Over the last 10–15 years, cooperation between the EMCDDA and the Western Balkans has developed, with support from specific EU programmes (2). Substantial progress has been made in this time in defining national drug strategies and setting up national drug coordination mechanisms, drug information systems and focal points in the region. Today’s review draws on these achievements, particularly on data gathered and analysed in national reports submitted by Western Balkan countries to the EMCDDA. Key findings Lifetime prevalence of drug use in the general population (15–64 years) appears to be lower than the European average. Among school students (15–16 years), estimates of lifetime illicit drug use fall between 4 % and 8 %; 2.5 times lower than the European average. Estimated population sizes of people who inject drugs (PWID) vary between the countries, but are significant. This is reflected in significant epidemics of hepatitis C among this group in the region.There has been a substantial effort to develop treatment options and needle and syringe exchange progammes in the region, but the coverage of these programmes remains generally too low to guarantee a significant and sustainable impact. Long-term financing of such programmes by states remains a challenge and should be prioritised. Investment in monitoring the drug situation and responding to it is still at a preliminary stage and needs to be consolidated. This would provide decision-makers with the evidence required to identify needs and priorities for interventions and to adapt them to the local context. The emergence of national drug strategies, in line with the EU Drug Strategy and Action Plans, as part of the region’s approximation to the EU, represents significant progress. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/fs5/western-balkans-report_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0316	2015-03-13	UNK	EMCDDA participates in RARHA project meeting on monitoring alcohol use and its consequences	 Harmful and hazardous alcohol use is one of the main causes of premature deaths and avoidable diseases in the EU today. Highlighting the importance of this issue, the European Commission is funding, under the second EU Health programme, the Joint Action on Reducing Alcohol Related Harm (RARHA) project, which kicked off in Lisbon in January 2014. This week, the EMCDDA is participating in the latest meeting of the RARHA project in Athens (13–14 March). The event will focus on the results of developing and testing new RARHA instruments to monitor alcohol use and its consequences in Europe. Led by the Portuguese General-Directorate for Intervention on Addictive Behaviours and Dependencies (SICAD), the Joint Action involves 32 associated partners and 28 collaborating partners from both EU and non-EU countries. The EMCDDA is among the project’s collaborating partners and also a member of its Advisory Board. One of the core activities of the RARHA project (work package 4/WP4: ‘Monitoring’) is to improve the monitoring of alcohol use, risky alcohol use and abuse or dependence and alcohol-related harms (to the drinker and others), particularly via survey methodology. The EMCDDA is active in WP4, which includes the development of instruments (questionnaire and scales) and methodologies. Many European surveys exist that include measurements of alcohol use, abuse and problems. But these vary considerably and it is almost impossible to gain a European overview of the issue. The conclusions and recommendations of the three-year RARHA project are expected to bring substantial improvements in the quality and comparability of alcohol use information in Europe. The EMCDDA plans to build on the work of the project by taking a subset of the instruments developed under WP4 to include in its ‘European Model Questionnaire’ (EMQ). The EMQ already includes a short module on alcohol, but compatibility with European standards on this topic are likely enhance the information collected by EMCDDA on alcohol within its mandate of monitoring of polydrug use. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/current-pagetitle_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0319	2015-03-09	UNK	EMCDDA presents latest update on ‘new drugs’ from EU Early Warning System	 Among the public health concerns highlighted in the report are new synthetic opioids — often highly potent and sold as heroin to unsuspecting users — posing a high risk of overdose. Three of the five opioids reported in 2014 were fentanyls, a family of drugs that have caused hundreds of deaths in Europe and the US. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘New psychoactive substances can move quickly from obscurity to infamy and cause serious harm. The data presented today show how the growth in the market of these substances will continue to pose challenges for public health and drug policy in the years to come. These challenges relate to the speed at which the substances appear, their open sale and the lack of information on their effects and harms. Strong national and regional early-warning systems will play a central role in the early detection of harms and help to ensure timely public health responses.’ In 2014, the list of substances reported was dominated once again by two groups: synthetic cathinones (31 substances) and synthetic cannabinoids (30 substances) — respectively sold as legal replacements for stimulants and cannabis. These now represent the two largest groups monitored by the EWS and, together, make up almost two-thirds of the new drugs notified in 2014.New psychoactive substances (NPS or ‘new drugs’) were detected in the European Union last year at the rate of around two per week, according to an update issued today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA)(1). A total of 101 new substances were reported to the EU Early Warning System (EWS) in 2014 (up from 81 in 2013), continuing an upward trend in substances notified in a single year (2). This brings the total number of substances being monitored by the agency to over 450, with more than half of that figure being identified in the last three years alone. The report is released to coincide with the opening of the 58th session of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) in Vienna, where the EMCDDA is participating alongside the EU delegation. It is based on an analysis of information collected by the EWS from the 28 EU Member States, Turkey and Norway. Latest data on seizures suggest a growth in the NPS market. Between 2008 and 2013, there was a seven-fold increase in the number of NPS seizures across Europe. Almost 47 000 seizures of NPS, amounting to more than 3.1 tonnes, were reported in Europe in 2013. Synthetic cannabinoids accounted for the majority of these figures (21 000 seizures; 1.6 tonnes), followed by synthetic cathinones (11 000 seizures; 1.1 tonnes). Many NPS are produced in bulk by chemical companies based outside Europe, and shipped to Europe by air freight, where they are processed, packaged and then sold to consumers. In addition to monitoring new drugs entering the market, the EWS also identifies signals of serious harms and responds as necessary. In 2014, serious harms demanding urgent attention led to 16 public health alerts, while six risk assessments were conducted by the agency’s extended Scientific Committee (3). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/1/cnd-new-drugs_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0320	2015-02-27	UNK	EMCDDA hosts Euro-DEN meeting and promotes guidelines: ‘When to call the emergency services for unwell recreational drug users’	 The recreational drug scene has evolved rapidly over the last decade, with new psychoactive substances (NPS) posing additional challenges. However, at present, there is no robust pan-European system in place for capturing data from hospital emergency services on the acute toxicity (harms) associated with the use of both ‘established drugs’ and NPS (1). To address deficiencies in the data available, the European Drug Emergencies Network (Euro-DEN) project was established in 2013, funded through the European Commission’s Drug Prevention and Information Programme. The EMCDDA is a member of the Euro-DEN Steering Committee and is hosting its latest meeting in Lisbon today. Marking the occasion, the agency is also publishing, in its Best practice portal, new Euro-DEN guidelines on: ‘When to call the emergency services for unwell recreational drug users’ (see section NPS).  Euro-DEN consists of a network of 16 sentinel centres in 10 countries across Europe with specialist clinical, toxicological and research interests in the acute toxicity (harm) of both established drugs and NPS. During a 12-month data-collection period (October 2013– September 2014), the Euro-DEN centres recorded over 5 500 presentations to emergency departments with acute drug toxicity. The aim of today’s meeting will be to finalise the project’s final report, scheduled for release at the end of March. In addition to undertaking data collection, the Euro-DEN project has also developed a training package for staff working in recreational settings (e.g. nightclubs and bars) focusing on the patterns of acute toxicity of drugs/NPS and how to help individuals who develop these. The training package is designed to improve the health and wellbeing of European citizens by improving the identification and management of acute toxicity by staff employed in this environment. It has been piloted in nightlife settings in four European cities — London, Oslo, Pärnu and Tallinn. The results of the pilot study will be published in the Euro-DEN project’s final report. The guidelines published today form part of this training package. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/euro-den_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0321	2015-02-16	UNK	ECDC and EMCDDA release a joint rapid risk assessment on wound botulism among people who inject heroin	 Today, two EU agencies, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) have released a joint rapid risk assessment on wound botulism among people who inject heroin (1). This follows a request by the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety, in response to an increase in the number of cases of wound botulism in this group reported in two EU Member States. Between December 2014 and 10 February 2015, 23 cases of wound botulism among people who had injected heroin were reported in Norway (8 confirmed cases) and Scotland (6 confirmed and 9 probable cases). All of the cases were reported to have involved heroin use and most involved the intramuscular injection of the drug. In all the Norwegian cases, the individuals had bought the drugs in the Oslo area. For all the UK cases, where information is available, the drugs were bought in, or sourced from, Glasgow. The source of infection is thought to be contaminated heroin. The geographical distribution of the potentially contaminated heroin is unknown at this time; however, if the contaminated heroin is still in circulation, further cases may occur. Whether there is a link, or not, between the outbreaks in the two countries is currently unknown. However, based on information currently available on the temporal and geographic clustering of cases, it is possible that the cases are connected through exposure to the same batch, or batches, of contaminated heroin. The risk of additional cases occurring in other countries of the EU/EEA may depend on the stage in the heroin distribution chain where contamination took place. If contamination occurred at an early (wholesale) level of heroin distribution, new cases may occur in other countries. As Clostridium botulinum is not transmitted from person to person, the risk to the general population in relation to these cases is negligible. The two EU agencies will continue to monitor the situation through their respective early warning systems (ECDC: ‘Early Warning and Response System’; EMCDDA: ‘EU Early Warning System’). Joint ECDC–EMCDDA guidance on the prevention and control of infectious diseases among people who inject drugs is available online.  Wound botulism in people who inject heroin in Norway and the United Kingdom Norway : 8 cases (all confirmed) Scotland:  15 cases (6 confirmed, 9 probable) Total cases = 23 cases 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/ni6/wound-botulism_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0322	2015-02-12	UNK	EMCDDA welcomes new moves to make hepatitis C medications more accessible to patients	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) welcomes new moves to make hepatitis C medications more accessible to those affected by the virus in line with its previous statements. Hepatitis C is the most common infectious disease in injecting drug users, among whom it is usually transmitted through the sharing of injecting equipment such as needles and syringes.  Hepatitis C is caused by the blood-borne hepatitis C virus (HCV) and affects primarily the liver. Often known as the ‘hidden epidemic’, hepatitis C infection can go for long periods undiagnosed, with many of those infected showing either mild or no symptoms for 20 years or more. Chronic infection can lead to cirrhosis of the liver after many years and, in some cases, liver failure and liver cancer. Research has demonstrated that HCV treatment can be applied with the same level of success among recent and former drug users as among other patients. A new medication, Sofosbuvir — introduced into Europe in 2014 — has been shown, not only to stop the further progress of the disease and its consequences, but also to allow full recovery in most patients. However, the very high cost of treatment with this drug — up to EUR 100 000 per treated case reported in some instances — have limited the wider application of this new treatment. Now some countries are finding ways to make such medications more affordable and accessible to those in need. In Portugal, for example, a recent agreement reached between the Ministry of Health, the National Authority of Medicines and Health Products (Infarmed) and the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, establishes a treatment plan for hepatitis C patients. While prices have not been made public, the plan will reportedly allow for the treatment of up to 13 000 individuals in the country over the next two to three years, including patients whose disease has not yet reached the most problematic states. These new developments should speed up urgently needed improvements in access to HCV treatment. Discussions on pricing are also taking place in other EU Member States (e.g. Germany) and there is hope that dropping prices will help to make treatment more affordable to national health systems and, therefore, more accessible to drug users. The EMCDDA will monitor these positive developments and provide information on evidence-based best practice in this area. It will also serve as a platform for exchange on national experiences in implementing and scaling up these new treatments. An EMCDDA Insights publication on the treatment of hepatitis will be released later in 2015.  Media articles Público Spiegel 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/hepatitis-c-medications_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0323	2015-02-12	UNK	New EMCDDA annual work programme published today	 A major task in 2015, also in cooperation with Europol, will be the preparation of the second EU drug markets report (for release in 2016). Further progress is also expected to be achieved in the development of drug supply indicators. This includes the pilot implementation of revised reporting instruments on: drug seizures; drug production facilities; and drug law offences. In terms of data-collection tools and processes, a prominent element in the programme is the launch of a revised national reporting package, following extensive consultation with the Reitox focal points. The new package, which determines how data are reported from the Member States to the EMCDDA, is designed to ensure efficiency, match priorities and resources and better address the information needs of European and national stakeholders. The EMCDDA has been preparing beneficiary countries of the EC’s Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) for participation in its work since 2008. After the successful closure of its IPA 4 project in 2014, and confirmation from the European Commission, the agency embarks on IPA 5 this spring. Finally, a critical task for the EMCDDA in 2015 will be ensuring the ongoing implementation of the EU Early Warning System on new psychoactive substances (NPS). Speaking of the challenges in this area before the European Parliament Committee for Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 21 January, Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘The EMCDDA leads the world in the collection, exchange and analysis of information on new psychoactive substances’. However, he regretted that current resources were insufficient for the agency ‘to cope with the increasing number of substances being identified’ and ‘to ensure effective monitoring’. The EMCDDA has published today its 2015 annual work programme, adopted by its Management Board on 5 December. The new programme sets out the objectives for the final year of the agency’s 2013–15 strategy (1) and promises to build a solid bridge between current priorities and those defined for the next three years (2016–18). Among the new features in 2015 will be the transformation in the way in which the agency presents statistics online. Changes will include: a clearer distinction between data and analysis; improved documentation of methods; and a better web interface. This will be one of the highlights of the 2015 European Drug Report package (June), for which delivery on the web will remain a central theme. In the course of the year, the agency will publish four in-depth reviews in its Insights series on: psychiatric comorbidities; hepatitis C treatment; wastewater analysis; and the Internet and drug markets. A review on the drug policies of large cities will also be produced, as well as a joint EMCDDA–Europol threat assessment on methamphetamine. Evidence-based decision making will continue to be supported by the recently revamped Best practice portal. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/fs4/work-programme-2015_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0324	2015-02-06	UNK	Customs Laboratories European Network (CLEN) meets in Lisbon	 The Portuguese Taxes and Customs Authority and the EMCDDA are hosting in Lisbon this week the second meeting of the European Commission’s (EC) Customs Laboratories European Network (CLEN) project group, funded by the EC Customs 2020 programme. The meeting is focusing on ‘Designer drugs and other illicit products’. The event is being organised by the EC’s Directorate-General (DG) for Taxation and Customs Union and the Institute for Health and Consumer Protection of the Joint Research Centre, with the participation of the DG for Migration and Home Affairs. The CLEN project group is composed of customs laboratories from the 28 EU Member States and aims to promote cooperation among them. CLEN representatives are joined at the meeting by scientists from the EMCDDA as well as forensic experts from the public and private sectors. Also attending are members of the Portuguese General-Directorate for Intervention on Addictive Behaviours and Dependencies (SICAD) and the Portuguese Judicial Police (PJ). The EMCDDA has been at the forefront of the world’s efforts to monitor new drugs for over 15 years. In partnership with Europol, it has been tracking the rapid emergence of these substances via the EU Early Warning System on new psychoactive substances. The new drugs phenomenon is developing at an unprecedented pace. This is reflected, not only in the large number of substances appearing, but also in their diversity and in how they are produced, distributed and promoted. With new substances from diverse chemical groups emerging rapidly and sold in combination with other drugs, one of the main challenges to responding effectively to new psychoactive substances is their forensic identification. The need to identify and assess increasingly diverse sets of chemicals, and the costs of doing so, requires a more robust cooperation and increased sharing of chemical data, reference samples and expertise among customs laboratories. The two-day meeting provides a unique opportunity for representatives of these laboratories to share experiences, compare their practices and discuss the next steps of the project. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/clen-meeting_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0325	2015-02-03	UNK	Mortality among drug users in Europe	 Drug use is one of the major causes of mortality among young people in Europe, both directly through overdose (drug-induced deaths) and indirectly through drug-related diseases, accidents, violence and suicide. Every year, over 6 000 drug users die of overdose in the EU, most of these deaths involving opioids and occurring among problem drug users. To gain a clearer picture of the overall number of lives lost due to drug use in Europe, a new EMCDDA Paper builds investigates ‘all-cause’ mortality among problem drug users via cohort studies linking data from death registries to drug treatment records. The study finds that the risk of death among problem drug users is typically 10 or more times that among their peers in the general population. The analysis shows that the deaths of problem drug users are overwhelmingly premature and preventable. The study is available in English and can be downloaded here. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/mortality-among-drug-users-in-Europe_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0326	2015-01-30	UNK	New EMCDDA trendspotter study explores online supply of drugs	 Social media were found to play an active role in drug markets, whether used directly for buying and selling drugs or indirectly for marketing, opinion-forming or experience-sharing. Smartphone apps were also seen to be being used in drug supply, with one study showing a growth in apps promoting illicit drug use. Use of the ‘surface web’ (accessible via common search engines) for the sale of NPS has received increased attention over the last decade. In 2013, EMCDDA online monitoring identified 651 websites selling ‘legal highs’ to Europeans. However, a recent development in the online market, highlighted in today’s study, is the sale of NPS on the ‘deep web’. The report refers to an increasingly blurred dividing line between ‘surface web’ and ‘deep web’ operations, resulting in a ‘grey market’ (with some sites having a ‘surface web’ presence, but with underlying elements on the ‘deep web’). A prominent subject in the study are ‘cryptomarkets’, or ‘deep web’ online marketplaces. These allow goods and services to be exchanged between parties who use digital encryption software (e.g. Tor) to conceal their identities. Traditional street drugs and some prescription medicines are reported to be most popular products on these ‘cryptomarkets’. Silk Road was the best-known ‘cryptomarket’, which operated as a Tor-hidden service using bitcoin as its trading currency. Illustrating the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between law enforcement and Internet drug vendors, it was closed by the FBI in October 2013, replaced a month later by Silk Road 2.0 and ultimately closed by Interpol in November 2014. The online sale of counterfeit medicines — described in the report as a major global enterprise — raises concerns that illegitimate online pharmacies may become a source of supply to the illicit drug market in the future. According to the study, this is an area ‘likely to require further monitoring’. The speed with which the Internet is transforming drug markets poses a major challenge to law enforcement, public health, research and monitoring agencies. This is according to The Internet and drug markets, the latest ‘trendspotter’ study from the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) released today (1). The study aims to raise understanding of the current online supply of drugs and to map the range of Internet markets in existence. The study kicked off with data collection and a literature review in September 2014 and culminated in an expert meeting in Lisbon from 30–31 October. Insights were provided from the fields of IT, research, monitoring and law enforcement and from the perspectives of Internet and drug users. Special focus was placed on the online sale of new psychoactive substances (NPS) and medicinal products for illicit use; the role of social media and apps; and drug sales on the ‘deep web’ (inaccessible via standard web browsers). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/fs3/internet-drug-markets_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0329	2015-01-19	UNK	New EMCDDA review studies the effectiveness of overdose antidote, naloxone	 Can naloxone provided in the community help reduce the thousands of drug-induced deaths recorded in Europe every year?  This is the question explored by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in a new paper released today: Preventing fatal overdoses: a systematic review of the effectiveness of take-home naloxone.  Naloxone — a pharmaceutical drug used to reverse the effects of opioid overdose — has been used in emergency medicine (e.g. ambulance crews, hospital emergency-room teams) for over 40 years (1). As many overdoses occur in the presence of drug users' family members or peers, however, empowering bystanders to act effectively, before emergency services arrive at the scene, can save lives (2).  Following pilot initiatives in the 1990s, measures to scale up naloxone availability to those likely to witness an overdose have emerged in the last decade. This has been driven partly by the epidemic of opioid-related deaths (heroin and non-heroin) in the USA (3). Analysing 21 studies conducted in four countries — Canada, Germany, UK and the USA — today’s review examines the latest evidence on the role of take-home naloxone (THN) in reducing opioid overdose fatalities. It concludes that THN provision, delivered with educational and training interventions, can be effective in reducing overdose-related deaths and improving knowledge on the signs of overdose and the correct management of patients.  Listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an ‘essential medicine’, naloxone is available in injectable form, with non-injecting administration also under investigation. Programmes and trials with THN distribution are currently run in seven European countries: Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Spain, Italy, UK and Norway (Annex 3 of review). Since September 2013, Estonia has offered a naloxone programme to tackle the sharp rise in deaths caused by illicit use of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. In 2014, Norway began a pilot of a nasal spray naloxone programme.  The report shows how evidence supports THN provision as part of a comprehensive harm reduction response (Figure 2). WHO guidelines on community-based naloxone provision were launched in November 2014 and a number of European countries have now developed national guidelines. Knowledge exchange on THN is important to allow potential implementers to take informed decisions (4). Drug use is one of the major causes of mortality among young people in Europe. Overall, some  6 100 overdose deaths were reported in Europe in 2013. Substances associated with the risk of overdose include: opioids (non-medical or prescribed); benzodiazepines and synthetic opioids (e.g. fentanyls). Can naloxone provided in the community help reduce the thousands of drug-induced deaths recorded in Europe every year?  This is the question explored by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in a new paper released today: Preventing fatal overdoses: a systematic review of the effectiveness of take-home naloxone.  Naloxone — a pharmaceutical drug used to reverse the effects of opioid overdose — has been used in emergency medicine (e.g. ambulance crews, hospital emergency-room teams) for over 40 years (1).

EMCDDA_UNK_0330	2015-01-15	UNK	Registration opens for fourth European drugs summer school	 The University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL) and the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) will be joining forces again this summer to hold the fourth European drugs summer school (EDSS) on 'Illicit drugs in Europe: demand, supply and public policies' (1). Registration opens today for the two-week course, which will take place in the Portuguese capital from 29 June to 10 July (2). The initiative is also supported by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) (3). Through a multidisciplinary and interactive approach to the drugs problem, EMCDDA scientific experts and ISCTE-IUL-professors, along with leading academics, guest speakers and policymakers, will prepare participants to meet the complex policy challenges in this field — both in Europe and beyond. Week 1 of the summer school focuses on ‘Monitoring the problem’ and will feature lectures on: problem drug use; drug supply in Europe; and detecting new drugs. Week 2 is dedicated to ‘Hitting a moving target’, with lectures on: broadening the scope (addictive behaviours and dependencies); international drug policy; and the analysis of best practice as a means to enable decision-making. ‘Keynote lectures’, a prominent feature of the summer school, will be continued in 2015 with a new set of speakers lined up to address the students. The target audiences for the EDSS are: university students, researchers, professionals and administrators interested in working on drugs issues. The previous rounds of the summer school brought together students from the EU Member States as well as representatives from Asia and Latin America. Profiles of former alumni and their testimonials can be found on the official summer school website and their statements viewed in a promotional video (4). In 2015, students will again be able to apply for scholarships and ‘early-bird’ reductions are available (5). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2015/EDSS-registration_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0331	2014-12-01	UNK	Gaps in HIV prevention expose Europe to risk of outbreaks	 In Europe, decades of investment in effective HIV prevention measures targeting people who inject drugs continue to bear fruit as demonstrated by the long-term decline in HIV diagnoses related to drug injecting. Over the past ten years, the rate of newly reported HIV diagnoses attributed to injecting drug use in the EU, Turkey and Norway has more than halved from 52 per million population in 2004 (2644 cases) to 25 in 2013 (1458 cases) (see figure below, data source: ECDC, 2014). Uneven investment in HIV prevention makes Europe vulnerable The trend can quickly change, however, as it did when HIV spread rapidly among injecting drug users in Greece and Romania in 2011 and 2012. In the absence of effective measures to curb these epidemics, the explosive spread of infections among injecting drug users in the capital cities resulted in these two countries accounting for more than one third of all new HIV diagnoses associated with injecting drug use notified in the whole of the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) in 2012, whereas in 2010 they had represented only 2% of the total. In 2013, all but four EU/EEA countries reported rates of new HIV diagnoses associated with injecting drug use below 10 per million population. However, Lithuania reported a rate of 21 and Greece of 22 new diagnoses per million population, while Latvia and Estonia reported 38 and 55 new diagnoses per million population, respectively. EMCDDA data show that while the coverage of interventions such as opioid substitution treatment and needle and syringe programmes is increasing in the EU, substantial populations of people who inject drugs have limited access to effective prevention services, making Europe vulnerable to outbreaks. In the most recent edition of its yearly expert meeting on drug-related infectious diseases, the EMCDDA addressed risks of outbreaks using a multi-indicator methodology. The agency has established close collaboration with ECDC, and the two EU agencies work together to assist Member States in carrying out tailored assessments of the HIV risk situation and prevention measures. In the most recent example of this cooperation, a joint ECDC-EMCDDA technical team visited Latvia at the invitation of the national authorities. The joint mission report will be presented to policymakers.  The EMCDDA warns that new HIV infections related to the injection of drugs – including stimulants – have been reported in many countries, particularly in Eastern Europe. Of particular concern is the fact that many of the injecting-related cases in Europe are detected too late. Special attention should be given to providing these often hard-to-reach groups of drug users with adequate prevention messages, early diagnosis and treatment referral and to scaling up effective integrated harm reduction measures.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/hiv-infections_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0334	2014-11-14	UNK	Pregnancy and opioid use: strategies for treatment	 Illicit opioid consumption is associated with an increase in obstetric complications in pregnant women. It also brings with it a range of potential dangers for the child, both before and after birth. Neonatal complications include narcotic withdrawal, postnatal growth deficiency, microcephaly, neurobehavioural problems, increase in neonatal mortality and an increase in sudden infant death syndrome. In a new EMCDDA Paper published today, the EMCDDA looks at strategies for treating pregnant opioid users. It describes how the primary goal in treating opioid dependence in pregnant women is to stabilise the patient, in order to avoid the permanent fluctuation of plasma levels and related foetal consequences (e.g. foetal distress and preterm birth). Psychosocially assisted opioid substitution treatment (OST) is the first-line treatment for opioid dependence in pregnant women and several combinations of substitution medicines and psychosocial approaches are available. The pharmacological interventions studied in this overview were methadone, buprenorphine and slow-release oral morphine (SROM). The psychosocial interventions covered were cognitive behaviour approaches and contingency management. The observed differences between the three substitution approaches did not show a homogeneous and comprehensive pattern to conclude that one treatment is superior to the others for all relevant outcomes. While methadone seems superior in retaining patients in treatment, buprenorphine seems to yield to less severe neonatal abstinence syndrome and higher birth weight. All the psychosocial interventions included in the review gave similar results in terms of dropout rate and reduction of drug use, with contingency management obtaining promising results in one study. Recent World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on pregnant women (1) consider psychosocial interventions to be an integral component of treatment (regardless of the type of medication selected for the OST). The report concludes that: ‘Studies of pregnant women are complex for several reasons, including ethical and practical difficulties. It is therefore crucial that we exhaustively analyse all elements of existing studies in order to add to the discussion’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/pregnancy-opioid-use_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0335	2014-10-23	UNK	Click and learn with the EMCDDA’s new-look Best practice portal	 Real-life responses to drug problems come under the spotlight today as the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) launches its revamped Best practice portal (1). Designed as a practical and reliable source of what works, and what doesn’t, in the areas of drug-related prevention, treatment, harm reduction and social reintegration, the portal helps practitioners and professionals: identify tried and tested interventions quickly; allocate resources to what’s effective; evaluate and improve interventions applying practical tools, standards and guidelines; and take better decisions, gaining from experience and expertise across Europe. Aiming to ‘put the user first’, the new-look portal is the result of an extensive process of user-testing. Among its revised features are a dynamic FAQ section, to which users can add their own questions, as well as a raft of new search functions. Summarising evidence in plain language, demystifying terminology and answering real questions from the field, the re-designed portal provides an accessible tool to support the development of evidence-based interventions. Using an information-layering approach, a vast array of data and research is presented in top-level ‘answer sheets’, complemented by underlying levels demonstrating the current evidence base. Among the portal’s added value is its overview of standards and guidelines available in the EU Member States to boost the quality of interventions. This comes at a time when Europe’s health and social responses to drug problems are increasingly supported by guidelines and quality standards, which translate evidence into satisfactory and sustainable results. The portal concentrates on illicit drugs and polydrug use and has a clear European focus. Intended as a ‘living product’, it will be regularly updated as information and research on interventions emerge. The main body of the portal is in English, but documents in other EU languages are also available according to where the interventions occur. Available throughout the portal are links to further information sources. The current EU drugs strategy (2013–20) underlines the need to: ‘promote the use and exchange of best practices and develop and implement quality standards in prevention (…), early detection and intervention, risk and harm reduction, treatment, rehabilitation, social reintegration and recovery’. The EMCDDA’s recast mission statement (2006) prioritises the provision of information on best practice in the EU Member States and the exchange of such practice between them. With the new portal, the EMCDDA aims to bridge scientific evidence and current practice in the drugs field. By enhancing the communication of evidence, it aims to promote the sharing of best practice between countries and better inform decision-making processes, both at national and European level. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/fs12_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0336	2014-10-13	UNK	Drug-related harms and responses in focus at annual EMCDDA expert meetings	 Latest evidence in the area of drug overdose, HCV infections and HIV outbreaks among drug users will be among the topics discussed in a series of events unfolding this week at the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in Lisbon (1). Two EMCDDA expert meetings, dedicated to the agency’s drug-related deaths and mortality among drug users indicator (DRD) and the drug-related infectious diseases indicator (DRID), will be held from 15–17 October, featuring individual and joint sessions, technical workshops and plenaries. The multifaceted programme is in line with a new, integrated approach to the agency’s expert meetings, launched in 2013, designed to inspire cross-discipline analyses of the drugs problem, including responses to it (2). Through this approach, the agency intends to obtain greater value from these annual expert events, strengthening what have become, over the last 10 years, valuable networks of excellence. This week’s meetings are expected to provide valuable insights into current European trends in drug-related health harms and to explore ways of targeting prevention responses more effectively and improving access to treatment. The meeting will also focus on important and emerging issues, such as: new and changing groups of injectors; access to new HCV treatments; harms related to new psychoactive substances; cannabis-related emergencies; and polydrug use (including the misuse of medicines). The EMCDDA uses five key epidemiological indicators to achieve its goal of providing ‘factual, objective, reliable and comparable information’ on drugs and drug addiction at European level (3). Endorsed by the Council of the EU in 2001, the indicators underpin the agency’s reporting on trends and developments in the EU drug situation and are crucial to the analysis of interventions and policies (4)(5). The role of take-home naloxone in reducing overdose deaths The expert groups will be preceded on 14 October by a satellite event focusing on the role of take-home naloxone (THN) in reducing opioid-related fatalities. Leading experts on the issue will come together at this meeting to focus on the scaling up of interventions using this medication across Europe. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used worldwide in emergency medicine to reverse respiratory depression caused by opioid overdose. When used in peer programmes, naloxone distribution is accompanied by training (for drug users, their peers and family) in First Aid techniques and in how to administer the medicine to reverse the effects of overdose (6). The upcoming meeting will explore the rationale for THN as part of a comprehensive response to reducing overdose deaths. The EMCDDA will present its upcoming paper on the Effectiveness of take-home emergency naloxone to prevent heroin overdose. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/fs11_en

The first graduation ceremony took place in 2012 at the EMCDDA which, together with the European Centre for Social Welfare Policy and Research, was involved in shaping the multidisciplinary programme (2). The graduation will be held at the end of a two-day meeting during which students will discuss the course and their projects. The call for applications for the third EMDAS (2014–16) is open (3). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/2nd-emdas_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0338	2014-09-25	UNK	Four new drugs to be placed under control	 Today, EU Ministers adopted a European Commission proposal to control four new psychoactive substances currently raising health concerns in Europe. With today's decision, the substances MDPV, methoxetamine, AH-7921, and 25I-NBOMe will be subject to control measures and criminal penalties throughout the EU and their manufacturing and marketing will become illegal. Today's decision is in line with the three-step legal procedure designed to respond to potentially harmful new psychoactive drugs in the EU (Council Decision 2005/387/JHA). In April 2014, the extended EMCDDA Scientific Committee examined the four drugs and submitted its risk-assessment reports to the European Commission and the Council of the EU. On the basis of these, the Commission recommended to the Council on 16 June that the drugs be submitted to control measures across the EU. Today’s decision on subjecting these four substances to control measures will enter into force following its publication in the Official Journal. Member States will then have one year to introduce the controls into national legislation. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/four-new-drugs-to-be-placed-under-control_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0339	2014-09-24	UNK	EMCDDA unites expert networks in integrated approach to monitoring	 ‘Continuity and change: high-risk drug use and drug treatment in Europe’, is the focus of events unfolding this week at the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in Lisbon (1). Two parallel EMCDDA expert meetings, dedicated to the agency’s treatment demand indicator (TDI) and the problem drug use indicator (PDU), precede a broader, common event open to specialists from outside the two groups. The proceedings are expected to provide valuable insights into measuring problem drug use and demand for treatment in Europe and will allow experts to interact across the subject areas. The initiative is in line with a fresh, integrated approach to the agency’s expert meetings, launched in 2013, designed to inspire cross-discipline analyses of the drugs problem and responses to it (2). Through this approach, the agency intends to obtain greater value from these annual events, strengthening what have become, over the last 10 years, valuable networks of excellence. The week’s programme focuses, among others, on: TDI expert meeting (23 September): state of progress of implementing the TDI indicator across Europe, including advancements in countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the Instrument of Pre-Accession (IPA); recent data analyses; TDI in the broader treatment and addiction monitoring system; and a new project to improve estimates of treatment capacity in Europe. PDU expert meeting (23 September): three workshops on indirect methods to estimate high-risk drug use (multiplier, capture–recapture, multivariate indicator methods); feedback on related guidelines and advanced methodological issues; state of progress of implementing the PDU indicator across Europe; and new studies in Greece, Finland and the UK. ‘Continuity and change’ common event (24–26 September): trends and developments in high-risk opioid use; opioid treatment coverage and needs; ageing drug users; vulnerable populations; monitoring systems and information technologies; high-risk use of stimulants, benzodiazepines and cannabis; cost of treatment and the impact of economic recession; treatment outcomes; and evaluating best practice and monitoring treatment effectiveness. The EMCDDA uses five key epidemiological indicators to achieve its goal of providing ‘factual, objective, reliable and comparable information’ on drugs and drug addiction at European level (3). Endorsed by the Council of the EU in 2001, the indicators underpin the agency’s reporting on trends and developments in the EU drug situation and are crucial to the analysis of interventions and policies. Participating in the proceedings are specialists from across the European Union, five Balkan countries and North America as well as from Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and international organisations. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/fs10_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0340	2014-09-19	UNK	European Parliament President Martin Schulz to visit EU agencies in Lisbon	 EMSA Director Markku Mylly, European Parliament Martin Schulz, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz (click to see more photos on Flickr.com Newly re-elected President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz will visit the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) on 23 September, accompanied by Secretary of State for European Affairs Bruno Maçães and Mayor of Lisbon António Costa (1). The visit follows on from President Schulz’ first visit to the EU agencies on 20 June 2013 when, along with Mayor Costa and the two agency directors, he inaugurated Praça Europa, the square on which the agencies are located. The inauguration followed a ceremony at the Lisbon Town Hall at which Mr Schulz received the keys to the city (2). The visit will begin with tours of the EU agencies, followed by meetings with EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz and EMSA Director Markku Mylly. Mr Schulz will also meet staff members of the two bodies and learn about their ongoing projects and challenges. The proceedings will close with a press conference. The EMCDDA and EMSA were set up in 1993 and 2002, respectively, and have been located on a common site in Lisbon since 2009. This follows a 2004 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Portuguese Government and the agencies on the establishment of headquarters in the city (3). The MoU recalled that the EP has defended the principle that: ‘whenever a Member State hosts more than one European agency in a city located in its territory, it should pursue its best efforts to find premises suitable for joint use and introduce good financial management practices in order to reduce maintenance costs’. This month, the European Commission complimented the EMCDDA and EMSA on their efforts to strengthen cooperation, minimise costs and, where possible, share services. It acknowledged that the two bodies are pioneers in this area, setting an example to other EU agencies. This collaboration is in line with the latest budget discharge reports from the European Parliament and takes place in the context of increasingly limited financial and human resources. Martin Schulz was elected President of the European Parliament on 17 January 2012 for a mandate of two and half years. On 1 July 2014, he became the first President in the history of the institution to be re-elected for a second term. Mr Schulz is member of the Socialists and Democrats Group in the European Parliament. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/8_en

Six experts from the two European agencies are in Riga this week to review the status of HIV and hepatitis surveillance, prevention and control measures together with country experts and health service providers. The current ECDC–EMCDDA mission will focus in particular on the availability of harm reduction for drug users, testing and vertical transmission of HIV/HBV and will propose key actions for strengthening local services based on the assessment of the situation. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/latvia-hiv_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0342	2014-07-28	UNK	Published today on World Hepatitis Day: New EMCDDA review on hepatitis C virus infection among people who inject drugs in Europe	 People who inject drugs (PWID) are a key population affected by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Treatment options are improving and may enhance prevention; however access for PWID may be poor. To coincide with World Hepatitis Day, the open-access online journal PLOS ONE publishes the results of an EMCDDA systematic review on data for the scaling up of HCV treatment and prevention for PWID across the European Union. The study, one of the largest conducted on this topic and involving over 80 collaborators, concludes that data on HCV epidemiology, care and disease burden among PWID in Europe, while sparse, suggest many undiagnosed infections and poor treatment uptake. The burden of disease, where assessed, was high and is expected to rise in the next decade. The authors reviewed the published literature from 2000, as well as data provided by the agency’s drug-related infectious diseases (DRID) expert network. Data availability was found to be highly variable across countries and topic areas, while important limitations exist both in comparability and representativeness. Below are some of the findings: HCV incidence among PWID was often high, with over one in ten PWID newly infected per year of exposure (range 2.7–66). Chronicity rates vary both above and under the expected 75% (range 53–97%), suggesting the existence of country differences. Genotypes 1 and 3 predominate among PWID, but 4 appears to be increasing, while the proportion of ‘difficult to treat’ genotypes (1+4) shows large variation (17–91%, median 53%). HIV prevalence in HCV-infected PWID varies widely (0–70%, median 3.9%). Half of the chronically infected PWID were unaware of their infection (median 49%, range 24–76%), and, of those diagnosed, only one in ten entered treatment for Hepatitis C (median 9.5%, range 1–19%). The study concludes that stronger efforts are needed to improve data availability to guide the scale-up of HCV treatment among PWID. 28 July: World Hepatitis Day ‘Hepatitis: Think again’ is the theme of this year’s World Hepatitis Day. Viral hepatitis kills 1.5 million people worldwide each year, as many as those killed by HIV/AIDS. But for the world’s eighth biggest killer, viral hepatitis is remarkably neglected. For this reason, the World Health Organization made World Hepatitis Day one of only four official disease-specific world health days, to be commemorated each year on 28 July. Millions of people across the world now take part in World Hepatitis Day to raise awareness about viral hepatitis and to call for access to treatment, better prevention programmes and government action.

EMCDDA_UNK_0343	2014-07-15	UNK	Eurojust and EMCDDA pledge to boost cooperation	 Exchanging strategic and technical information in the areas of drug legislation and supply was among the pledges made today in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the EU judicial cooperation unit (Eurojust). At an official ceremony in The Hague, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz and President of Eurojust Michèle Coninsx reaffirmed their agencies’ commitment to strengthening action against illicit drugs and related crime in the EU. Today’s MoU focuses on drug-related matters relevant to judicial cooperation — including drug supply, drug supply reduction and legislation — and will be implemented through joint activities, decided on the basis of the partners’ respective work programmes. The MoU also reflects the focus of the 2014–2017 EU Policy Cycle for organised and serious international crime, under which the Council of the EU prioritises specific objectives to address the trafficking of synthetic drugs, cocaine and heroin. The MoU will enhance the organisations’ already productive cooperation, helping them work together to collect, analyse and disseminate relevant data; pool technical expertise; establish joint projects; and ensure the optimal use of resources and information. The EMCDDA and Eurojust have worked closely together since 2007 and share a common interest in the enforcement and implementation of drug trafficking laws across Europe. Since that time, Eurojust has participated in the EMCDDA annual meetings of legal experts and contributed to the EMCDDA–Europol EU Drug Markets report: a strategic analysis, published in January 2013. The EMCDDA contributed to a strategic seminar on drug trafficking, organised by Eurojust and the Polish Presidency in Krakow in 2011, and will take part in Eurojust’s strategic meeting on drug trafficking in The Hague in September. Eurojust is highly active in the fight against drug trafficking, having registered 502 cases over the last two years — more than with any crime type except fraud. It has also been involved in all projects under the Council’s European Multidisciplinary Platform against Criminal Threats (EMPACT) in the area of drug trafficking. A crucial area of cooperation between the organisations will be the collection of policy relevant data on drug supply. The EMCDDA was tasked in 2009 with establishing key indicators in this area. Following Council conclusions on improving the monitoring of drug supply in the EU (November 2013), the EMCDDA will work with its partners to improve data collection in this area, supported by its reference group on drug supply indicators, set up in 2013. Eurojust is expected to be a key player in this group. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/7_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0344	2014-06-30	UNK	Third European drugs summer school opens today in Lisbon	 The third European drugs summer school (EDSS) — ‘Illicit drugs in Europe: demand, supply and public policies’ — opens today in Lisbon and will run until 11 July. The initiative, organised by the University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE) and the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), is supported by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). A wide variety of academics, researchers and professionals from the EU Member States, the US and Latin America have signed up for the course. Over the two weeks, EMCDDA scientific experts, along with leading academics and policymakers, will prepare participants to meet the complex policy challenges in this field. Week 1 of the summer school focuses on ‘Defining the problems’ and will feature lectures on: the production and geopolitics of drugs; high-risk drug use in Europe; and detecting new drugs. Week 2 explores ‘Understanding drug policies and interventions’, with lectures on: international drug policy and European laws; treatment and social reintegration; harm reduction and prison health. A new line-up of keynote speakers will address the course including: Professor Robert West (University College London); Professor Susan Michie (University College London); Professor Henrique Barros (University of Porto); Frank Francis (MAOC-N) and Björn Hibell (ESPAD coordinator). For the first time on the course, EDSS students will be able to view video lectures and participate in live on-screen discussions with civil society representatives in Greece and the Netherlands. Another feature in this year’s programme will be two study visits to: a Lisbon prison and one of Portugal’s Commissions for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction. The course will close with a speech from Minerva-Melpomeni Malliori (University of Athens) and a debate on drug policies after the economic recession. The first two summer schools in 2012 and 2013 brought together around 60 students from over 15 EU Member States, as well as countries from Asia and Latin America. Profiles of former alumni and their testimonials can be found on the official summer school website and their statements viewed in a promotional video. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/fs7_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0345	2014-06-25	UNK	26 June: International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking	 An estimated 28 000 lives are lost on Europe’s roads every year and a further 1.34 million people are injured (1). Many of these accidents and deaths are caused by drivers whose performance is impaired by a psychoactive substance. Alcohol remains the number one substance endangering lives on European roads, but use of drugs and medicines behind the wheel, particularly when combined with alcohol, is a major challenge for policymakers. In a new report out today, Drug use, impaired driving and traffic accidents, the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) reviews the latest research in this field (2). ‘Alcohol, especially in high concentrations, must remain the principal focus of prevention measures’, says the EMCDDA. But it calls for combined drug and alcohol use by drivers to be addressed ‘more intensively’, given its association with a ‘very high risk of a traffic accident’. The report states: ‘Statistically, the use of amphetamines, cannabis, benzodiazepines, heroin and cocaine is associated with an increased risk of being involved in and/or being responsible for an accident, and in many cases, this risk increases when the drug is combined with another psychoactive substance, such as alcohol’. Released ahead of International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking (26 June), the report updates a literature review published by the agency in 2008. The new edition includes the results of the European Commission-funded DRUID project (2006–11), which contributed key evidence to road safety policy by mapping Europe’s drink- and drug-driving problem across 13 countries (3). Also examined are over 500 studies, published in Europe and internationally up to 2013, with a greater emphasis placed on meta-analyses and systematic reviews, which combine and summarise the most recent findings. The research is split into two study types: epidemiological (e.g. roadside surveys) and experimental (e.g. performance tests). The report reveals how cannabis (THC) is the most frequently detected illicit drug in drivers (followed by cocaine and amphetamines) and benzodiazepines the most frequently found medicine. Large differences are observed among countries, with more alcohol and illicit drugs found in southern Europe and more medicinal drugs in northern Europe. The report explores methodology, prevalence and the effects of substances on performance. It concludes: ‘The chronic use of all illicit drugs is associated with some cognitive and/or psychomotor impairment and can lead to a decrease in driving performance even when the subject is no longer intoxicated’. Among concerns raised in the report is the variety of drugs available today: ‘The range of psychoactive substances available for illicit use is increasing, and recent studies are finding evidence of their use among drivers’. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘We are all aware of the link between alcohol and road traffic accidents and this is reflected across Europe in a robust policy response to the problem. Less well understood, and of growing importance for future policy development, however, is how the use of other psychoactive substances may affect driving performance. As drug consumption patterns change, particular concerns arise. These include: an ever-expanding range of psychoactive substances and medicinal products as well as context-specific risks such as those posed by young people driving home from nightlife venues after consuming a mix of alcohol and drugs’. Götz adds: ‘Today’s report provides a state-of-the-art review of the growing evidence base on substance-impaired driving. I am convinced that it will not only prove a timely, and much-needed, tool for understanding this rapidly-evolving area, but also facilitate the development of more comprehensive road safety policies’. The prevention of driving under the influence of drugs is one of the priorities outlined in the current EU drugs action plan (2013–16). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/content/26-june-international-day-against-drug-abuse-and-illicit-trafficking_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0346	2014-05-27	UNK	EU drugs agency places six topics in the spotlight with new online analyses 	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) releases today alongside its European Drug Report 2014: Trends and developments, six new additions to its Perspectives on drugs (PODs) series. This latest selection of online, interactive analyses provides a state-of-the-art review of key aspects of the European drug situation. The PODs explore: emerging concerns relating to stimulant use; new developments in Europe’s cannabis market; as well as advances in Internet-based treatment and wastewater analysis. Synthetic cathinones: worrying localised and national outbreaks of injecting Over 50 synthetic cathinone derivatives (stimulants) were detected via the EU Early Warning System (EU–EWS) between 2005 and 2013. Among those monitored by the EU–EWS are: mephedrone (submitted to control measures in the EU in 2010); MDPV (risk assessed in April 2014); and pentedrone. Synthetic cathinones can be snorted in powder form or swallowed as tablets; but the EMCDDA explores today worrying outbreaks of injecting these substances. Although the injection of cathinones is not widespread in Europe, it has been noted as a localised problem in groups of high-risk drug users in some countries (e.g. Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Spain, Austria, Poland, Finland, Sweden and the UK). In Hungary and Romania, however, a more generalised practice of injecting these substances has been observed. A nationwide survey of needle- and syringe-exchange programmes in Hungary, for example, revealed that, in 2012, 36 % of clients were injecting cathinones as their primary drug. A behaviour of growing concern — seen in sub-groups of men who have sex with men (MSM) — is that of injecting a variety of illicit drugs (e.g. cathinones and methamphetamine) in so-called ‘chem sex’ parties. To date, this new practice, associated with risky sexual practices, has been reported in some large cities. Given the potential impact of the emerging patterns of cathinone injection identified, close monitoring of the issue is a public health priority. Methamphetamine: increasing concern as new and diverse patterns of use emerge Methamphetamine is an established stimulant drug in many parts of the world (e.g. Southeast Asia, US), where it has long caused major public health problems. While methamphetamine use in Europe has historically been confined to the Czech Republic and Slovakia, new pockets and patterns of use are now emerging elsewhere and in diverse populations. Examples include the sniffing of methamphetamine (powder) by recreational users in Germany; the smoking of ‘crystal meth’ by injecting opioid users in Greece, Cyprus and Turkey; and the injection of the drug with other substances among MSM (see above). In this new analysis, the EMCDDA looks at challenges for the provision of health and social responses related to this drug today. Although there are no approved medications for treating methamphetamine dependence, psychosocial interventions have proven effective. The agency says: ‘Europe’s current methamphetamine problem has no single face and appropriate responses will need to be adapted, developed and tailored to the local patterns of use and problems observed’. Reviewing progress with medications to treat cocaine dependence Cocaine is still Europe’s most commonly used illicit stimulant and challenges remain in treating cocaine dependence. In 2012, 14 % of clients entering specialist drug treatment in Europe reported cocaine as their primary substance. The EMCDDA presents today a meta-analysis of six reviews examining the effectiveness of medications used in treating cocaine problems, as well as their acceptance by users. The original reviews, by the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group, involved 92 studies (85 in the US) and over 7 000 participants. These show how some medications can reduce users’ cravings, yet no single pharmacological solution has been found for cocaine dependence. As research in this area progresses, psychosocial interventions remain a core element in treating cocaine users (see video). Domestic herbal cannabis production, a major supply source — imported resin getting stronger Europe has long been one of the world’s largest consumer markets for cannabis, particularly resin imported mainly from Morocco. Some 2 050 tonnes of cannabis resin (‘hashish’) and herbal cannabis (‘marijuana’) are estimated to be consumed in Europe every year. Today, the EMCDDA reports how Europe’s consumer market for cannabis is now dominated by herbal products, with domestic herbal production supplying domestic use. Cannabis plantations are increasingly found across Europe. Over the last decade, the number of seizures of herbal cannabis in Europe has overtaken that of resin. Some 457 000 herbal cannabis seizures were reported in 2012, compared with 258 000 resin seizures. Around seven million cannabis plants were seized in 2012, over 2.5 times the quantity reported five years earlier. Innovations in cannabis production in recent years are cause for concern (see video), with growers cultivating plants high in THC (the active ingredient in cannabis) but low in CBD (an anti-psychotic). While the potency of both forms of cannabis has risen since 2006, relatively sharp rises in the potency of resin have been seen between 2011 and 2012 (see cannabis infographic, EDR, Chapter 1). Internet-based drug treatment — offering new ways of engaging with drug users The Internet is now recognised as a plausible vehicle for delivering drug and alcohol education, prevention and treatment programmes in a range of settings. Today, the EMCDDA charts developments in Internet-based drug treatment (IBDT), which has expanded in Europe over the past 10 years, mainly relating to cannabis use. IBDT takes a set of tested psychosocial techniques and integrates them into a new web-based delivery mechanism. Although data protection and anonymity are important issues to address, the benefits gained from this type of service delivery can include: greater geographical coverage; access to users not reached by specialist drug services; and more immediate assistance (no waiting times). As IBDT programmes develop, they may form a useful complement to traditional treatment services, offering new ways of engaging with drug users in need of help (see video). Largest multi-city study on drug wastewater analysis released today The findings of the largest European project to date in the emerging science of wastewater analysis are also released today. The project in question analysed wastewater in over 40 cities (21 countries) to explore the drug-taking habits of those who live in them. Its conclusions are taken up in an EMCDDA POD dedicated to the issue. Wastewater from approximately 8 million people was analysed for traces of five illicit drugs: amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy and methamphetamine (news release 5/2014). The results provide a valuable snapshot of the drug flow through the cities involved, revealing marked regional variations in drug use patterns. Traces of cocaine, for example, were higher in western and some southern cities but lower in northern and eastern cities. Use of amphetamine, while relatively evenly distributed, showed the highest levels in the north and northwest of Europe. Methamphetamine use, generally low and traditionally concentrated in Central Europe, now appears to be spreading. And when weekly patterns of drug use were examined, cocaine and ecstasy levels rose sharply at weekends in most cities, while methamphetamine and cannabis use appeared to be more evenly distributed throughout the week. Chairman of the EMCDDA Management Board, João Goulão says: ‘This year, the EMCDDA highlights an array of new challenges posed by stimulants and other drugs. In particular, the agency explores the emerging and growing evidence base for treating problems related to cocaine, methamphetamine and cannabis use. A common element here is the importance of psychosocial interventions which represent a valuable part of our therapeutic toolbox for responding to contemporary drug problems’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/4_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0347	2014-05-27	UNK	European Drug Report out today — Europe’s drugs problem ‘increasingly complex’	 Europe’s drugs problem is becoming increasingly complex with new challenges emerging that raise concerns for public health. This is according to the European Drug Report 2014: Trends and developments released today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in Lisbon (1). In its annual review of the drugs problem, the agency again describes an overall stable situation, with some positive signs in relation to the more established drugs. But this is counter-balanced by new threats posed by synthetic drugs, including stimulants, new psychoactive substances and medicinal products, all of which are becoming more prominent in a changing European drug market. European Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmström says: ‘I am deeply concerned that the drugs consumed in Europe today may be even more damaging to users' health than in the past. There are signs that the ecstasy and cannabis sold on the street are getting stronger. I also note that the EU Early Warning System, our first line of defence against emerging drugs, is coming under growing pressure as the number and diversity of substances continue to rise sharply. The system has already reviewed this year four new substances linked to acute intoxications and deaths in the Member States’. Commissioner Malmström adds: ‘Europe’s law-enforcement bodies are increasingly faced with the fact that small, easily transported packages of seemingly innocuous powders can contain many thousands of individual doses. This annual analysis from the EMCDDA provides us with a critically important window on Europe’s evolving drugs problem. But this information must now feed into law-enforcement, prevention and treatment. It is essential that we use these data to ensure that the response by European authorities keeps pace with the evolving challenges we face’. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘Looking at the big picture, we see that progress has been made in Europe on some of the major health policy objectives of the past. But the European perspective can obscure some important national differences. Our latest data show how encouraging overall EU trends on overdose deaths and drug-related HIV infections, for example, sit in sharp contrast to worrying developments in a few Member States’. Recognising this complexity, the report provides a top-level overview of the long-term drug-related trends and developments at European level, while also homing in on emerging problems in some countries. Heroin in decline, but replacement substances cause concern Although global heroin production remains high and quantities seized in Turkey are rising (Figures 1.4; 1.5), latest data on the demand for treatment and on seizures in Europe point to a downward trend in the use and availability of this drug. The number of reported first-time entrants to specialist drug treatment for heroin problems fell from a peak of 59 000 in 2007 to 31 000 in 2012. Data on drug supply show that the quantity of heroin seized in 2012 (5 tonnes) was the lowest reported in the last decade, half the amount seized in 2002 (10 tonnes). The number of heroin seizures also fell from some 50 000 in 2010 to 32 000 in 2012. There are an estimated 1.3 million problem opioid users in Europe, mostly heroin users. The report raises concerns over heroin being replaced by other substances, such as synthetic opioids. Illicitly produced or diverted from medical sources, these include highly potent fentanyls and substances used in opioid substitution treatment (OST) (e.g. methadone, buprenorphine). In 2012, 17 countries reported that over 10% of first-time opioid clients entering specialist treatment were misusing opioids other than heroin (Figure 2.9). Drug-related deaths: overall reduction, but rises in some countries Drug use is one of the major causes of mortality among young people in Europe, both directly through overdose (drug-induced deaths) and indirectly through drug-related diseases, accidents, violence and suicide. Overall, around 6 100 overdose deaths, mainly related to opioids, were reported in Europe in 2012. This compares to 6 500 reported in 2011 and 7 100 cases in 2009. Progress made in this area may be partly attributed to the scaling up of treatment and harm reduction (e.g. OST). Nevertheless, in contrast to an overall encouraging European trend, overdose deaths remain high, or are increasing, in some countries. The average mortality rate due to overdoses in Europe is estimated at 17 deaths per million population (15–64 years), but with wide national variations. Rates of over 50 deaths per million were reported in five countries, with the highest rates reported in Estonia (191 per million) and Norway (76 per million), followed by Ireland (70 per million), Sweden (63 per million) and Finland (58 per million) (Figure 2.13) (2). While heroin is still involved in many fatal overdoses, deaths relating to this drug are generally falling and those linked to synthetic opioids are on the rise in some countries. Overdose deaths rose sharply (by 38%) in Estonia in 2012, with fentanyl and its derivatives present in most cases. Non-controlled fentanyl derivatives and a range of other potent synthetic opioids (e.g. AH-7921) have been increasingly reported on the illicit market through the EU Early Warning System (EU–EWS). HIV: outbreaks in some countries impact negatively on EU trend Over the last decade, large gains have been made within the EU in addressing HIV infection among people who inject drugs — these include a greater coverage of prevention, treatment and harm-reduction measures. Latest findings show, however, that developments in some countries, are impacting negatively on the long-term decline in the number of new HIV diagnoses in Europe. ‘Outbreaks of HIV among drug users in Greece and Romania, together with ongoing problems in some Baltic countries, have stalled Europe’s progress in reducing the number of new drug-related HIV infections’, states the report. The average rate of newly reported HIV diagnoses attributed to injecting drug use was 3.1 per million population in 2012. In Estonia, the rate of new diagnoses remains high (53.7 cases per million in 2012), while in Latvia, annual rates have been rising since 2009 (up from 34.5 cases per million in 2009 to 46.0 in 2012). There were 1 788 newly reported HIV cases in 2012, slightly more than in 2011 (1 732), continuing the upward trend observed since 2010 (Figure 2.11). Whereas in 2010, Greece and Romania contributed just over 2% of the total number of newly reported diagnoses among those infected through injecting drug use in the EU, by 2012 this figure had increased to around 37% (with Greece reporting a rate of 42.9 cases per million population and Romania 8.0 cases). Despite Europe’s success in fighting HIV transmission among drug users, the virus retains the potential to spread rapidly in certain groups. A 2013 EMCDDA–ECDC risk-assessment exercise to examine countries vulnerable to new HIV outbreaks revealed that one or more risk indicators were present in around one-third of the 30 countries examined (3). This suggests a need for continued vigilance and better coverage of HIV prevention measures (Figure 3.5). Stimulants: cocaine stable or declining, but concerns around methamphetamine and MDMA Cocaine remains the most commonly used illicit stimulant drug in Europe, although most users are found in a small number of western EU countries. An estimated 14.1 million European adults (15–64 years) have ever used the drug; 3.1 million in the last year (see ‘At a glance’ table). Recent data suggest declining use of cocaine, with 11 out of 12 countries running surveys between 2011 and 2013 reporting falls in prevalence among young adults (15–34 years). Looking at long-term trends in cocaine use, decreases were seen in Denmark, Spain and the UK (all reporting relatively high prevalence rates), following a peak in 2008 (Figure 2.5). Most other countries show stable or declining trends. Use of amphetamines (encompassing amphetamine and methamphetamine) remains overall lower than that of cocaine in Europe, with around 11.4 million adults reporting lifetime use and 1.5 million last-year use. Of the two drugs, amphetamine is more commonly used, but there are growing concerns around the availability and use of methamphetamine in Europe. Today’s report describes how methamphetamine seizures, while still small in number and quantity, have increased over the last decade, suggesting increased availability of the drug (Figure 1.10). In 2012, 7 000 seizures amounting to 343 kg were reported in the EU. A further 4 000 seizures, amounting to 637 kg, were reported by Turkey and Norway (almost twice the amount seized in the entire EU). Methamphetamine use, historically low in Europe and mainly limited to the Czech Republic and Slovakia, now appears to be spreading (e.g. in Germany). Worrying reports are emerging from south-east Europe (Greece, Cyprus, Turkey) that crystal methamphetamine smoking is a limited, but emerging, problem, with the possibility of a spread among vulnerable populations. And methamphetamine injecting has been reported as a new trend among small groups of men who have sex with men in some large European cities (4). Also highlighted today are concerns over the re-emergence of high-quality ecstasy (MDMA) powders and pills. Seizures and reports of adverse health events have prompted Europol and the EMCDDA to release a joint warning on the availability of high-potency products containing MDMA (5). Europol reports the dismantling in Belgium in 2013 of the two largest drug production sites ever found in the EU, capable of rapidly producing large volumes of MDMA. New psychoactive substances: EU Early Warning System ‘under increasing pressure’ The rise in the number, type and availability of new psychoactive substances (NPS or ‘new drugs’) in Europe shows no signs of abating, says the EMCDDA. In 2013, 81 new drugs were notified for the first time to the EU Early Warning System (EU–EWS) (6). This brings the number of new substances monitored by the agency to over 350. According to today’s report, the system is ‘coming under increasing pressure from the volume and variety of new drugs appearing on the market’. Almost 250 substances were detected in the last four years. New psychoactive substances, not controlled under international law, are often sold on the market as ‘legal highs’ and produced with the intention of mimicking the effects of controlled drugs. Twenty-nine of the drugs detected last year were synthetic cannabinoids, the largest group currently monitored by the EU–EWS. The speed at which recently controlled drugs have been replaced by new substances has prompted a variety of innovative legal responses across Europe (Chapter 4). New drugs may be produced in clandestine laboratories inside Europe. More commonly, however, they are sourced legally as powders mostly from China and India, and imported into Europe where they are processed, packaged and sold as ‘legal high’ products or ‘research chemicals’, as well as sold directly on the illicit drug market. The Internet continues to play a key role in shaping the NPS market. In 2013, the EMCDDA identified some 650 websites selling these substances to Europeans. In addition, purchasing new and ‘old’ drugs via ‘darknets’ — underground, online networks permitting anonymous communication — represents a new challenge for law enforcement. Highlighted today are signs that, in some countries, these substances are now targeting the main segments of the drug market. In April 2014, the EMCDDA Scientific Committee risk-assessed four potent and harmful new substances: 25I-NBOMe, AH-7921, MDPV and methoxetamine. These are being sold as replacements for, and could even be more harmful than, the drugs they aim to mimic, respectively: LSD (hallucinogen), morphine (opiate), cocaine (stimulant) and ketamine (a medicine with analgesic and anaesthetic properties). Risk-assessment reports on the four substances have been submitted to the European Commission and the Council of the EU, on the basis of which decisions for EU-wide control measures may be taken. The emergence of highly potent synthetic substances is a concern flagged by notifications to the EU–EWS. This has implications for both users and law enforcement — such substances can be toxic at very low doses and even small quantities of these drugs can be used to make many individual doses. Cannabis: controversies, contrasts, contradictions Attitudinal surveys from the EU (7) suggest that cannabis is still the drug that polarises public opinion the most. This contributes to a lively public debate, which has recently been fuelled by international developments in how cannabis availability and use are controlled (e.g. regulatory changes in some states of the US and in parts of Latin America). European discussions on cannabis control have tended to focus on targeting drug supply and trafficking rather than on personal use. However, the overall number of possession and use offences related to cannabis has been rising steadily for nearly a decade (Figure 4.1). Around 73.6 million Europeans have tried cannabis in their lifetime, 18.1 million in the last year. An estimated 14.6 million young Europeans (15–34 years), report last-year use. Cannabis use in Europe appears overall to be stable or declining, especially in young age groups. National trends appear more divergent, however, as shown by the fact that of the countries reporting new surveys since 2011, eight reported decreases and five reported increases in last year prevalence (15–34 years) (Figure 2.1). Public health concerns are greatest for Europeans who use the drug on a daily, or almost daily, basis (around 1% of European adults, 15–64 years). In 2012, cannabis was the drug most frequently reported as the main reason for entering drug treatment by first-time clients. ‘The lack of systematic monitoring in the area of drug-related health emergencies represents a blind spot in Europe’s surveillance of emerging health threats’, says the EMCDDA. From the limited data available, cannabis-related medical emergencies appear to be a growing problem in some high-prevalence countries. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz concludes: ‘I am proud of the insights provided by this report into both established problems and emerging threats. Sound information is at the heart of Europe’s response to drug problems and our interventions are all the more effective because of this. Over 15 years ago, great vision was shown by the EU institutions and Member States in investing in an EU Early Warning System on new psychoactive substances that is now globally respected. I believe that the system — which has repeatedly demonstrated its value for sharing information and rapidly responding to threats — can be strengthened further. I am deeply concerned, however, that this mechanism is under increasing strain and may be at risk if inadequately resourced’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/3_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0348	2014-05-27	UNK	Largest multi-city study on drug wastewater analysis released today	 The findings of the largest European project to date in the emerging science of wastewater analysis (WWA) are released today in an article published in Addiction (1). The project in question — steered by the Europe-wide SCORE network (2) — analysed wastewater in over 40 European cities to explore the drug-taking habits of those who live in them. Its conclusions are taken up in the European Drug Report 2014, launched by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) today, as well as in an online interactive analysis by the agency dedicated to the issue (Perspectives on drugs) (3). The purpose of the SCORE study was to assess geographical differences and temporal changes in illicit drug use in metropolitan settings across the region. It is the first, and most extensive, WWA application to date, covering multiple countries, over consecutive years (2011–13) and according to a fixed protocol. Wastewater analysis is a rapidly developing and novel scientific discipline with the potential for monitoring near-real-time, population-level trends in illicit drug use. By sampling a known source of wastewater, such as a sewage influent to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), scientists can now estimate the quantity of drugs used in a community by measuring the levels of illicit drugs and their metabolites excreted in urine. From London to Nicosia and Stockholm to Lisbon, the study analysed daily wastewater samples in the catchment areas of WWTPs over a one-week period in April 2012 and in March 2013. In 2012, the study involved 23 cities in 11 countries, while in 2013 it was broadened to 42 cities in 21 countries. Data from a 2011 study (19 cities, 11 countries) were used for comparison. Wastewater from approximately 8 million people was analysed for traces of five illicit drugs: amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy and methamphetamine. The WWA results provide a valuable snapshot of the drug flow through the cities involved, revealing marked regional variations in drug use patterns. Traces of cocaine, for example, were higher in western and some southern cities but lower in northern and eastern cities. Use of amphetamine, while relatively evenly distributed, showed the highest levels in the north and northwest of Europe. Methamphetamine use, generally low and traditionally concentrated in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, now appears to be present in the east of Germany and northern Europe. And when weekly patterns of drug use were examined, cocaine and ecstasy levels rose sharply at weekends in most cities, while methamphetamine and cannabis use appeared to be more evenly distributed throughout the week. ‘Wastewater analysis provides the possibility to collect and report measurements more quickly and regularly than is the current norm for national surveys’, concludes the report. If used more routinely as a complement to other European drug surveillance methods, it has the clear potential to shed extra light on drug use trends in Europe, including the use of new psychoactive substances. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/5_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0349	2014-05-15	UNK	International experts to examine latest findings in the field of new drugs	 International experts gather in Rome today to examine the latest scientific research in the rapidly-changing field of novel (or new) psychoactive substances (NPS). They will be participating in the Third international conference on novel psychoactive substances organised by: the University of Hertfordshire; the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA); the University of Chieti-Pescara; Sapienza University of Rome; the Società italiana di psichiatria and the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (1). The event follows on from the first two conferences held in Budapest (2012) and Swansea (2013) (2). The emergence of NPS and the ability of the Internet to disseminate information quickly, present a number of challenges for drug policy, substance use research and public health. Despite increased attention being paid to this issue, these emerging products — often unregulated and sold online as ‘legal’ and ‘safer’ alternatives to traditional illicit drugs — are rarely mentioned in the scientific literature. The prime objective of the NPS conference series is to increase knowledge and understanding on the nature and effects of NPS, as well as to promote innovative solutions in the field. The two-day conference will contribute, among others, to: sharing accurate, evidence-based information on NPS and on latest trends in NPS misuse; developing an international platform and other technological solutions for rapid information sharing; assessing psychiatric consequences of NPS use and related behavioural addictions; developing innovative prevention measures especially for vulnerable individuals; raising awareness and contributing to the development of effective prevention messages; exploring socio-cultural factors underlying risky behaviours; improving understanding of treatment and management approaches for patients with levels of clinical and/or behavioural toxicity associated with NPS use; and networking and providing the opportunity to meet renowned experts in the field. The EU Early Warning System, operated by the EMCDDA and partners, currently monitors over 350 new psychoactive substances. These include derivatives of phenethylamines, tryptamines, piperazines and cathinones, as well as synthetic cannabinoids and a small number of herbal substances that can produce psychoactive effects. Such a phenomenon highlights the importance of multinational and multidisciplinary collaboration in order to enhance knowledge and improve the quality of information sharing and best practice at a global level. The latest information on NPS in Europe will be published on 27 May in the EMCDDA’s European Drug Report 2014. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/fs6_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0351	2014-04-07	UNK	EMCDDA and ECDC facilitate sub-regional exchange of knowledge and best practice in monitoring and preventing drug-related infections	 Monitoring and responding to HIV and hepatitis C among people who inject drugs (PWID) is the focus of two new reports from the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The reports are the result of two expert meetings organised by the agencies last autumn which brought together key stakeholders from the areas of drug monitoring and infectious disease surveillance (1). The meetings had their roots in an ECDC–EMCDDA regional assessment of HIV trends, risks and prevention coverage among PWID conducted in mid-2013. This assessment had identified a low level of prevention coverage in at least one third of European countries, constituting a potential risk of increased HIV transmission among this group (2). The first expert meeting held in Bucharest (18–19 November 2013) — Detecting and responding to outbreaks of HIV among PWID — provided an important opportunity for sharing knowledge and best practice among experts from six countries in the south and south-east of the European region (Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Romania and Slovakia). The participants heard about the Greek response to an HIV outbreak among PWID, which started in 2011, and the subsequent scaling up of prevention interventions. This had been guided by monitoring data and research findings and resulted in significant progress in curbing the epidemic. Participants also discussed the situation in Romania, the second country to report an HIV outbreak since 2011. This outbreak has seen additional challenges associated with: high rates of co-infections; changing patterns of drug use among PWID; and the need to address funding gaps through a coordinated country-level response. The second meeting, a regional Reitox Academy held in Tallinn (21–22 November 2013) — Monitoring trends in and responses to drug-related infectious diseases among people who inject drugs — contributed to maximising synergies at national level between institutions and experts in the fields of drug monitoring and infectious disease surveillance in four countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland). The event helped participants from both fields to deepen their knowledge and mutual understanding of the situation; fostered joint initiatives at national level and further strengthened collaboration between neighbouring countries in the Baltic Sea region. Both meetings acknowledged the critical role and added value of collaboration between the EU agencies in assessing risk and providing technical support to countries as well as in informing policies with evidence-based guidance (3). Experts examined progress and defined common priorities regarding actions to be taken forward at national level (e.g. improvements in screening and prevention coverage) and recognised the key role of monitoring and surveillance for evaluating whether prevention efforts to are adequate to avert outbreaks. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/emcdda-ecdc_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0352	2014-04-01	UNK	Scientific Committee — elections for chair and vice chair	 The EMCDDA Scientific Committee, meeting in Lisbon this week, elected its new Chair and Vice Chair for the next three years. Prof. Dr Gerhard Bühringer (Germany) was elected to the position of Chair and Dr Anne Line Breteville-Jensen (Norway) to the position of Vice Chair. The Scientific Committee plays a major role in the EMCDDA’s efforts to attain scientific excellence. It is composed of 15 high-level scientists from the EU Member States, selected through a public selection process based on scientific merit and independence. The EMCDDA Director and Management Board consult the Committee on the agency’s work programmes or on any scientific matter concerning its activity. The Committee also plays a pivotal role in the agency’s risk assessment of new psychoactive substances (see below). Since members of the Committee are appointed in a personal capacity, they are required to provide opinions independently of their country and of the Community institutions. Prof. Dr Gerhard Bühringer, a psychologist, held the position of Vice Chair of the Scientific Committee from May 2011 to April 2014. He is Managing Director of the German Institut für Therapieforschung (IFT) and Professor for Addiction Research at the Technische Universitaet, Dresden. His research focuses on a range of issues, including: aetiology and the course of substance use disorders and pathological gambling, including vulnerability and risk factors. In addition, Prof. Dr Bühringer sits on a number of national and international scientific committees and advisory boards, including: the German Centre for Addiction Issues (DHS) and the International Society of Addiction Journal Editors (ISAJE). Dr Anne Line Breteville-Jensen is an economist. She is the Research Director at the Norwegian Institute of Alcohol and Drug Research, Chair of the editorial board of Nordic Studies on Alcohol and Drugs and serves on a number of scientific committees and advisory boards. Her research focuses mainly on illicit drug markets, influences of drug uptake, methodological issues, drug policy and choice theoretical perspectives on addiction. The EMCDDA wishes the Chair and Vice Chair well in their new functions. It also pays tribute to outgoing Chair Dr Marina Davoli for her valuable contribution in steering the Committee over the last three years. For more on the Scientific Committee and its work, see: www.emcdda.europa.eu/about/sc Four new drugs go under the microscope This week the Scientific Committee — with the participation of additional experts from the EU Member States, European Commission, Europol and the European Medicines Agency — carried out formal risk assessments of four new psychoactive substances: 25I-NBOMe, AH-7921, MDPV and methoxetamine. This was after harmful effects related to the drugs were reported by the Member States and picked up by the EU Early Warning System. Four risk assessment reports will be submitted to the European Commission and the Council of the EU, on the basis of which the Commission may recommend to the Council that the drugs be submitted to control measures across the EU.

EMCDDA_UNK_0353	2014-03-18	UNK	Regional drug strategies across the world explored in new EMCDDA paper	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) has released today its first comparative analysis of regional drug strategies across the world (1). The paper explores the drug strategies and action plans adopted over the last five years by six intergovernmental organisations, engaging 148 countries in four continents (2). ‘When seen in the light of the current international drugs policy debate’, states the paper, ‘regional drug strategies may provide an important contribution for assessing the drugs problem at international level’. International drug control has been consolidated over the last 50 years with the adoption, by United Nations (UN) member states, of three UN drug conventions (3) and two political declarations with corresponding action plans (4). The two action plans — endorsed in 1998 and 2009 — marked a change towards a more structured drug policy approach and called on UN member states to adopt comprehensive and balanced national drug strategies and establish regional mechanisms. Although neither the UN political declarations nor the action plans explicitly require the creation of regional drug strategies, they may have provided the impetus for neighbouring countries to agree on a common regional approach. Indeed, the decade between 1998 and 2009 witnessed the appearance of intergovernmental (regional) drug plans and strategies involving a number of African and Asian countries, as well as the renewal of action plans and strategies in the Americas and Europe. Drug strategies and action plans offer interesting insights, both when analysed individually and when compared across regions. Divided into two parts, today’s paper describes the way in which drug strategies are structured and addresses their main principles (e.g. respect for human rights; common and shared responsibility) and objectives (e.g. reducing the supply and demand for drugs). Part I offers a comparative analysis of the documents selected, highlighting the differences and similarities in structure and content. Part II profiles each intergovernmental organisation, describing its institutional structure, its drug strategy and action plan and regional coordination mechanism. The purpose of the paper is to inform decision-makers, professionals and researchers working on international drug policy about the way in which countries of the same region have decided to strategically approach drug-related security, social and health problems. It looks at the main approaches to demand and supply reduction and analyses the manner in which these interventions are referred from region to region. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/fs4_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0354	2014-03-05	UNK	Dangerous synthetic drugs hit the EU market	 Europol and the EMCDDA have issued today early-warning notifications about two synthetic drugs that have recently been linked to serious harms in the EU. The first concerns a new psychoactive substance associated with 18 deaths in the United Kingdom and eight in Hungary in 2013. 4,4'-DMAR — the para-methyl derivative of 4-methylaminorex — is not currently controlled by drug legislation in EU Member States. Also known as  ‘4-methyl-euphoria’, ‘4-methyl-U4Euh’, ‘4-M-4-MAR’, ‘4,4-dimethylaminorex’ or 'Serotoni', the substance has been found in Denmark, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom since it was first detected in 2012. The use of other drugs in combination with 4,4’-DMAR appears to have been a factor in most of the fatalities recorded. A range of adverse effects associated with 4,4’-DMAR have been reported, including agitation, hyperthermia, foaming at the mouth, breathing problems and cardiac arrest. 4,4’-DMAR has been found as a powder and in tablet form, with tablets having a variety of logos, colours and shapes, as detailed in the early-warning notification. Concern over this substance has led to the European Union Early-warning system (EWS) on new psychoactive substances — operated by the EMCDDA and Europol — to launch a joint exercise to better understand the harms posed by this substance.     The second warning focuses on ecstasy tablets that have been found with dangerously high levels of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine) in Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The potentially toxic levels of MDMA present in these tablets could lead to serious harm, and there have already been deaths associated with such tablets in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. MDMA tablets in the EU typically contain between about 60 and 100 mg of MDMA (2012 figures), however, tablets containing between 150 and 200 mg of MDMA are currently available and some have been found to contain even higher amounts, e.g. 240 mg. It is important to note that no illicit tablets can be considered safe as they can contain unexpected ingredients in unpredictable amounts. This development is particularly concerning in light of the significant increase in the production and availability of MDMA in the EU. As outlined in Europol’s 2013 Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment (SOCTA) and the 2013 EU Drug Markets Report, Belgium and the Netherlands remain centres for synthetic drugs production in the EU and are also among those Member States most affected by the recent resurgence in MDMA availability. Full news release and more information can be found on the Europol website. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/europol-emcdda1_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0355	2014-03-05	UNK	New EMCDDA technical assistance project with ENP countries kicks off today	 A new, two-year technical cooperation project between the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) kicks off today in Lisbon (1). The project takes place within the EMCDDA’s mandate for cooperation with third (non-EU) countries, as set out in its recast founding regulation in 2006 (2). The European Commission-funded project, which will run until December 2015, is designed to boost the capacity of ENP partner countries to react to fresh challenges posed by the drug phenomenon. This will be achieved through the exchange of know-how on national drug information systems and observatories and the sharing of information on best practice in demand reduction and on national strategies (including monitoring and evaluation). The project, which began on 1 January 2014, involves seven countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Israel, Moldova, Morocco and Ukraine. Representatives of national drugs bodies in these countries will attend this week’s official kick-off meeting (5–6 March) and discuss with EMCDDA staff the project goals and planning and a programme of national and regional activities for 2014. The initiative will provide scientific support for collecting and analysing information as well as producing ad hoc products corresponding to national, EU and EMCDDA needs. An important component of the project will be the exchange of information, working practices and methodology on the identification of new psychoactive substances with project partner countries. The ENP aims to forge closer ties with countries to the South and East of the EU. Through this policy, the EU seeks to strengthen the prosperity, stability and security of all countries concerned. Within the ENP, the EU offers its neighbours a privileged relationship, building upon a mutual commitment to common values (democracy and human rights, rule of law, good governance, market economy principles and sustainable development). The ENP includes political association and deeper economic integration, increased mobility and more people-to-people contacts. Countries from the Eastern and Southern Partnership which have not yet expressed an interest in participating in this technical cooperation project will have an opportunity to join at a later stage. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/fs3_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0356	2014-02-13	UNK	EMCDDA embarks on 2014 Work Programme	 Following a drop in the EU subsidy to the EMCDDA this year of some 5%, 2014 promises to be a particularly challenging year for the agency. The 2014 activities are therefore framed within the context of the realities we face today, which include a stable/diminishing reporting capacity at Member State level and reduced resources at our disposal. The 2014 budget is set at EUR 15.2 (down from 16.1 million in 2013).  The agency’s scientific work programme concentrates this year on providing high-quality analyses of the European drug situation, through better exploitation of the analytical potential of data resources now held by the agency and maximising the value of its expert networks. In the area of responses, work will focus on implementing the new treatment data collection and analysis strategy and on providing better estimates of treatment coverage within the different national systems. Additionally, priority will be given to improving the quality of data in the area of supply reduction.  The management of the EU early-warning system on new drugs will also be a key task. The rapid increase in the number of new psychoactive substances and the upcoming implementation of a new legal instrument will have a major impact on the work of the agency in 2014.  A top priority in 2014 will be the development of the EMCDDA’s web presence in the context of a new integrated and thematic strategic approach. Following the successful concept launched in 2013, the European Drug Report package will continue to develop, with delivery on the web being a central theme. The kick-off of a new technical assistance project aimed at enhancing drug monitoring capacity in European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) countries will be another exciting development in the course of the year.  Reflecting the agency’s strong commitment to developing a performance measurement system, well-defined performance indicators are presented in the document. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/work-programme_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0357	2014-02-04	UNK	EU drugs agency steps up cooperation with Israel	 The European Union and Israel will share information on drugs more systematically in future, thanks to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed today in Jerusalem between the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the Israel Anti-Drug Authority (IADA). The agreement was signed at the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs by EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz and IADA Director-General Yair Geller. Israel — a country of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) area — submitted a formal request for cooperation with the EMCDDA in 2012. This led to a green light from the EMCDDA Management Board in December that year for the agency to negotiate the MoU with IADA, Israel’s body responsible for drug- and alcohol-related policy.  Today’s accord — signed for an initial period of five years and sealing cooperation between the two partners — will be implemented through a joint work programme to be updated every three years. This programme will include steps to enhance the partners’ monitoring and knowledge base on the drugs situation and responses to it, particularly through harmonising key indicators in areas of both supply and demand.  Special attention will be given to the regular exchange of information on the appearance on the drug market and the use of new psychotropic substances, as well as the technologies employed in their production.  The agreement provides for an exchange of technical expertise and knowledge between the two bodies, the co-sponsoring of technical meetings and the pooling of human and financial resources to launch joint programmes. IADA will endeavour to present to the EMCDDA an annual report on the drug situation in Israel. The EMCDDA, for its part, will facilitate training as well as the exchange of experts and scientific research findings on issues of mutual interest.  Both organisations recognise that information on the drugs phenomenon is an essential and indispensable instrument for drafting and implementing drug policies and for assessing the impact of actions to reduce the problems originating from drug use and trafficking.  This cooperation takes place within the EMCDDA’s mandate for cooperation with third (non-EU) countries in consultation with its Management Board and the European Commission. The MoU, is based on the 1995 Euro–Mediterranean Agreement and the 2005 EU–Israel Action Plan, the latter establishing the general framework of EU–Israel bilateral relations. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/fs2_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0358	2014-01-31	UNK	EMCDDA hosts kick-off meeting of EC-funded Joint Action on Reducing Alcohol Related Harm	 Harmful and hazardous alcohol use is one of the main causes of premature deaths and avoidable diseases in the EU today. Highlighting the importance of this issue, the European Commission is funding the Joint Action on Reducing Alcohol Related Harm (RARHA) project, being launched in Lisbon on 31 January.  Led by the Portuguese General-Directorate for Intervention on Addictive Behaviours and Dependencies (SICAD) the Joint Action involves 32 associated partners and 28 collaborating partners from both EU and non-EU countries (1). The EMCDDA is among the project’s collaborating partners and also a member of its Advisory Board. The project aims to mobilise countries to develop common approaches in line with the EU alcohol strategy, including:  developing methodologies to conduct alcohol surveys and pool data for comparative assessments;  translating scientific evidence and knowledge into practical implications for good practice in alcohol-related interventions; and  producing a toolkit of potentially transferable interventions with evidence of effectiveness and cost estimates. The kick-off meeting, hosted by the EMCDDA, features opening addresses from Paulo Macedo, Portuguese Minister of Health; João Goulão, General-Director of SICAD; Wolfgang Götz, EMCDDA Director; Philippe Roux, Head of unit for Health determinants at the European Commission (DG-SANCO) and Paola D’Acapito, Project Officer at the Health unit of the European Commission’s Consumers, Health and Food Executive Agency (CHAFEA). Commenting on the initiative, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘This kind of project highlights the importance of alcohol and alcohol-related problems in Europe, and strongly signals the willingness and readiness of the EU Member States and the European and international community to respond to them. The EMCDDA is proud to be part of this project and we look forward to contributing to this joint endeavour’. For many years, there has been considerable policy concern about the interaction between alcohol and drug use in Europe and the harms this can bring. The EMCDDA’s own remit was broadened in 2006 to include the monitoring of polydrug use, where illicit drugs are taken in combination with licit substances or medication (2). Alcohol consumption forms part of almost all polydrug use repertoires and is present in all drug-using populations.  The Joint Action intends to contribute to the health and wellbeing of EU citizens and to reduce costs to health systems and the wider economy. It will mainly advise on the interaction of alcohol and drug use in Europe and on related best practice and interventions. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/sicad-rarha-conference_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0359	2014-01-29	UNK	Four new drugs go under the microscope in the wake of rising health concerns	 Europe has responded to rising concern over the use of four new drugs by formally requesting a scientific investigation into the health and social risks of the substances. The decision was communicated to the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) by the Council of the EU today, in line with a legal procedure designed to respond to potentially harmful new psychoactive drugs in the EU. The Council requests the EMCDDA Scientific Committee to conduct formal risk assessments of the four new substances — 25I-NBOMe, AH-7921, MDPV and methoxetamine — after harmful effects related to the drugs were reported by the Member States and picked up by the EU Early-warning system. The substances will be scrutinised by the Committee in Lisbon in April, with the participation of additional experts from the EU Member States, European Commission, Europol and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  The upcoming risk assessments will include an appraisal of the chemical and pharmacological properties of each drug and their abuse and dependence-causing potential. The health and social risks associated with the drugs, prevalence of use and the involvement of organised crime in their production and distribution will also be probed. Today’s decision is based on the findings of four EMCDDA–Europol Joint Reports submitted in December to the Council of the EU, the European Commission and the EMA. These reports are released today on the EMCDDA website and present the information collected on each substance from the EU Member States, Turkey and Norway. 25I-NBOMe, a substituted phenethylamine drug with apparent hallucinogenic effects, has been available on the EU drug market since at least May 2012 and has been detected in 23 EU Member States and Norway. Severe toxicity associated with its use has been reported in four Member States and three deaths associated with the drug have been reported.  AH-7921, a synthetic opioid drug, has been available in the EU since at least July 2012 and has been detected in seven EU Member States and Norway. In most cases, it has been seized in small quantities as a powder. Over a short period of time it has been associated with six non-fatal intoxications and 15 deaths in three countries. The similarity of AH-7921 to morphine in terms of its pharmacology is a key concern. This could play an important role in the further spread of AH-7921 by opioid users, including the injecting population. MDPV, a stimulant drug belonging to the group of synthetic cathinone derivatives, is closely related to pyrovalerone. MDPV has been present in the EU drug market since at least November 2008 and has been detected in up to 107 non-fatal intoxications and 99 deaths (particularly in Finland and the United Kingdom). There are some indications that it has been sold as a ‘legal’ or synthetic version of cocaine. It has also been found in tablets resembling ‘ecstasy’. Large seizures (including multi-kilogram quantities) have been made at borders and police operations have targeted its supply. Most, but not all the Member States, have control measures in place at national level covering MDPV; however, its continued availability is a cause for concern. Methoxetamine, an arylcyclohexamine drug, related in many respects to ketamine, has been available on the EU drug market since at least September 2010. It has been detected in 22 Member States, Turkey and Norway. Powder seizures have been reported including multi-kilogram quantities. One hundred and ten (110) non-fatal intoxications associated with the substance have been reported, as well as 20 deaths.  There have been some instances of these new substances being offered as replacements to controlled drugs. Methoxetamine, for example, is being marketed as a ‘legal and bladder-friendly' alternative to ketamine and, at the same time, is being sold directly on the illicit drug market as ketamine. Meanwhile, 25I-NBOMe has been sold as a ‘legal’ alternative to LSD or illicitly as LSD. Following the meeting of the Scientific Committee in April, four risk assessment reports will be submitted to the European Commission and the Council of the EU. On the basis of these reports, the Commission may recommend to the Council that the drugs be submitted to control measures across the EU. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2014/1_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0360	2014-01-15	UNK	Registration opens for third European drugs summer school	 The University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL) and the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) will be joining forces again in July 2014 to hold the third European summer school on ‘Illicit drugs in Europe: demand, supply and public policies’ (1). Registration opens today for the two-week course, which will take place in the Portuguese capital from 30 June to 11 July (2). The initiative is also supported by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Through a multidisciplinary and interactive approach, EMCDDA scientific experts and ISCTE-IUL-professors, along with leading academics, guest speakers and policymakers, will prepare participants to meet the complex policy challenges in this field. Week 1 of the summer school focuses on ‘Defining the problems’ and will feature lectures on: problem drug use in Europe; drug supply in Europe; and detecting new drugs. Week 2 explores ‘Understanding drug policies and interventions’, with lectures on: (inter)national drug policies; prison health; preventing drug use; and harm reduction. The course will end with a debate on the future of national and European drug policies. ‘Keynote lectures’, a feature premiered at the 2013 summer school, will be continued in 2014 with a new line-up of speakers scheduled to address the students. The first two summer schools in 2012 and 2013 brought together around 60 students from over 15 EU Member States, as well as countries from Asia and Latin America. Profiles of former alumni and their testimonials can be found on the official summer school website and their statements viewed in a promotional video (3). In 2014, students will again be able to apply for scholarships and ‘Early-bird’ reductions are available (4).

EMCDDA_UNK_0361	2013-12-20	UNK	EU drugs agency announces Scientific Committee line-up for next three years	 On 5 December, the EMCDDA Management Board appointed 15 high-level scientists to serve on the agency’s Scientific Committee for the period 2014–16. The selection followed a call for expressions of interest in the Official Journal of the European Union in February this year which yielded 79 eligible applications. The new members have been informed today of the Management Board’s decision. The mandate of the current Committee draws to a close at the end of 2013. The 15 members — selected from the EU Member States and Norway — were chosen, following a public selection process, on the basis of scientific merit and independence and their expertise in the most relevant scientific fields linked to the problems of drugs and drug addiction today. One third of the scientists appointed are new members, while 10 previously served on the Committee. As members are appointed in a personal capacity, they are required to give their opinions independently of their country and of the Community institutions. The Scientific Committee plays a major role in the EMCDDA’s efforts to attain scientific excellence. The agency consults the Committee on the quality of its work programmes and on any scientific matter concerning its activity, which the Management Board or the Director may submit to it. The Committee also plays a pivotal role in the agency’s risk assessment of new psychoactive substances. The Management Board invited the Chair (Marina Davoli) and Vice-Chair (Gerhard Bühringer) of the outgoing Committee to continue acting in these roles until elections take place at the first meeting of the new Committee in Spring 2014. In addition to appointing the members of the new Committee, the Board also established a reserve list. The EMCDDA thanks the outgoing Committee members for their role as guardians and advocates of the scientific integrity of the agency over two consecutive terms (2008–10 and 2011–13).   New Scientific Committee Gender Nationality Henri BERGERON M French Anne Line BRETTEVILLE-JENSEN F Norwegian Gerhard BÜHRINGER M German Catherine COMISKEY* F Irish Paul DARGAN* M British Marina DAVOLI F Italian Brice DE RUYVER M Belgian Gabriele FISCHER* F Austrian Henk GARRETSEN M Dutch Matthew HICKMAN M British Dirk KORF  M Dutch Krzysztof KRAJEWSKI M Polish Letizia PAOLI* F Italian Fernando RODRIGUEZ DE FONSECA M Spanish Rainer SPANAGEL* M German * denotes new member.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/fs13_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0362	2013-12-12	UNK	EMCDDA launches first four studies in a new series targeting policymakers and specialists	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) publishes today the first four studies in its brand new series of ‘EMCDDA Papers’. Primarily targeting policymakers and specialists, the papers are designed as brief and timely web-based products on a variety of topics in the drugs field. To be published several times a year, the papers will cover all aspects of Europe’s drug phenomenon, from consumption and markets to health and social consequences as well as the responses of the EU and its Member States to drug problems. Drug policy advocacy organisations in Europe — Civil society organisations engaging in drug policy advocacy in Europe are today organised, high-profile and impact-oriented. Presenting the results of a mapping study of such bodies in Europe, this paper describes how their development has been driven by greater ease of communication (facilitated by new technologies) as well as by the greater number of formal mechanisms through which policymakers can now be reached. For the purpose of the study, drug advocacy organisations were defined as bodies with a website-based Internet presence that contained a clearly stated aim to influence drug policy. Of the 218 organisations identified, 69 % operated on a national basis, around one-fifth (17 %) had a local or regional remit and over one-tenth (14 %) had a European or international remit. The paper concludes that changes in the nature, methods and impact of advocacy in the drugs area are evolving against a backdrop of economic crisis. And as drug services and law enforcement agencies come under increased financial pressure,  it is likely that the number and type of policy actors engaged in advocacy will grow. Drug squads: units specialised in drug law enforcement in Europe — Drug law enforcement is likely to be the intervention contributing the most to reducing drug supply in Europe. While important statistical datasets on drug seizures and drug law offences emerge from drug law enforcement activity, little is known about how drug law enforcement is organised in Europe. Based on a survey in 26 countries, this report provides the first European overview of units specialising in drug law enforcement (‘drug squads’) and identifies knowledge gaps. As such, the paper provides a monitoring baseline against which future changes can be compared. Data on the number of staff, institutional affiliations, mandates and functions of the more than 1 000 drug squads operating in Europe are presented and put into perspective. Drug supply reduction and internal security policies in the European Union: an overview —  The production and trafficking of illicit drugs pose complex and interlinked problems, which have a negative impact on public health and the security and stability of society. In responding to the dynamics of a globalised drug market, the EU and its partners are involved in actions within and outside the EU. Focusing on actions directed at the EU’s internal security situation, this paper explores who sets the policy, what legal and funding basis for action has been established, and what priorities have been drawn up. In doing so, the paper looks at the EU institutions and agencies predominately involved in managing drug supply reduction and internal security issues. It explores relevant EU treaties and legislations that provide a means to target illicit drug supply, as well as the financial instruments and programmes supporting this action. Co-morbid substance use and mental disorders in Europe: a review of the data — This paper reviews information on the co-morbidity of mental disorders among individuals with psychoactive drug or alcohol use problems. Findings from key European and non-European studies are presented, along with an overview of the information on co-morbidity reported to the EMCDDA by EU Member States and Norway in the last six years. While studies on the prevalence of co-morbidity have been carried out in other parts of the world, few have been conducted in Europe. The European studies presented here show a wide variation in prevalence levels, which may reflect methodological limitations, including the lack of harmonised European reporting on co-morbidity. Suggestions are made to stimulate the accumulation of knowledge and the comparability of information in this area in order to improve the evidence base available to policymakers. EMCDDA Papers are in line with the EMCDDA Communication strategy which promises, in the name of efficiency and value, to produce briefer web-based products and fewer lengthy volumes in print.

EMCDDA_UNK_0363	2013-11-29	UNK	EMCDDA launches new toolkit for monitoring infectious diseases among people who inject drugs	 Ahead of World AIDS Day on 1 December, the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) has released today a new toolkit offering countries the latest guidance on monitoring infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis (B,C), among people who inject drugs (PWID) (1). The toolkit is designed to help health professionals improve their monitoring practice in order to reduce the burden of disease in this vulnerable group and improve the coverage and quality of services delivered. Prepared closely with experts, country representatives and international and EU agencies (2), the toolkit updates  earlier guidance (3), and presents new monitoring methods and indicators in a more flexible and user-friendly format. It is currently composed of three modules: Module 1: Behavioural indicators — Behavioural and sociodemographic information is crucial to the monitoring of infectious diseases. This is because the transmission of viruses such as HIV and hepatitis B and C among PWID strongly depends on risk behaviours (e.g. needle sharing, unprotected sex) and socioeconomic, policy and other environmental factors (e.g. marginalisation, contact with services). The aim of this module is to propose a set of PWID-specific indicators that allow comparable, reliable and policy-relevant data to be collected on behavioural and sociodemographic aspects of blood-borne infections in this group in Europe. These indicators would complement existing biological monitoring and cover risk and protective behaviours, testing and service uptake. Module 2: Example questionnaire — The questionnaire presented in this module will help standardise the epidemiological measures used in the surveillance of behavioural and other drug-related infectious disease indicators. It provides detailed sample questions to be used in interviews in care centres or community settings and is designed to be applied in national or local studies. Module 3: Methods of bio-behavioural surveys — This module provides guidance on how to implement and use biological and behavioural studies conducted among PWID as a tool in routine surveillance at country and European level. It provides an overview of methods and existing resources for monitoring through repeated studies in this group. Among the issues discussed are the most recent methods to harmonise second generation surveillance of PWIDs in Europe (4). Preventing and controlling infectious diseases among PWID has been the focus of a series of EMCDDA–ECDC meetings held this autumn (5). The two agencies have also worked together on an updated joint risk assessment on HIV (6) and guidance on the Prevention and control of infectious diseases among people who inject drugs (2011)(7).

EMCDDA_UNK_0364	2013-11-25	UNK	EMCDDA hosts workshop on evidence sharing to prevent and reduce harm related to addiction	 Sharing evidence to help prevent and reduce harm related to addiction is the focus of a workshop hosted by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in Lisbon this week. The two-day event, opening today, is organised by the European Agency for Health and Consumers (EACH) (1), in collaboration with the European Commission (Directorates-General for Justice and Health and Consumers). The purpose of the workshop is to look at actions funded under the EU’s Health Programme (2008–13) and Drug Prevention and Information Programme (2007–13) (2), with a view to drawing on their results for the EMCDDA’s work and better disseminating their outcomes. Twenty-four European experts working on projects relating to drug and alcohol addiction and to prevention and harm reduction in nightlife settings will report on the findings of their work and highlight examples of best practice. Specialists from the EMCDDA will present the online prevention and harm reduction profiles developed by the agency since 2010 (3) and discuss how the participating experts can contribute to these resources. Discussions will focus in particular on closing information gaps, improving processes for validating data at national level and increasing the visibility of the profiles. Representatives of the Reitox national focal points (4) will participate in the meeting in order to boost collaboration between the network and specific projects funded under the abovementioned programmes. Three working groups will be organised during the workshop on the topics of: prevention; health and social responses; and best practice. These are designed to: identify and gather information that can be used to resolve information gaps in the EMCDDA profiles and make better use of research findings at national, regional and local level. The conclusions of the workshop will be presented in a paper designed to publicise the results of projects funded under the above EU programmes. This will describe how better use can be made of the project outcomes and explore how the results obtained can inform policies at EU and national level.

EMCDDA_UNK_0365	2013-11-15	UNK	Europe takes decisive step forward in monitoring drug supply	 A set of Council conclusions on improving the monitoring of drug supply in the European Union was adopted by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council meeting in Brussels today (1). While much progress has been made in the EU in recent years to improve the monitoring of drug demand, drug supply remains an area requiring further analysis. Recalling the conclusions of two European conferences on drug supply indicators in 2010 and 2012 (2), the Council states in this document that accurate, reliable, comparable and high-quality data on drug supply would help ‘assess the drug situation, the dynamics of the illicit drug market, the burden of drug-related crime and the effectiveness of supply-oriented policies’. In order to obtain sound data in this area, the Council acknowledges the need for key indicators at EU level, developed around a set of sub-indicators (seizures; purity and content; drug prices; drug production facilities dismantled; drug law offences; drug availability in the population; and market size). The paper recommends an approach which builds on existing data-collection and reporting structures and ensures that activities are cost-effective, realistic, feasible and deliver clear value at EU level. The EMCDDA is called upon to work with Europol, the Reitox network and other relevant EU networks on improving data collection in this area, supported by its reference group on drug supply indicators (set up in 2013). Member States are invited to collaborate with the European Commission, the EMCDDA and Europol with a view to improving the comparability and quality of data collected in the area of drug supply, as well as submitting available datasets to the agencies in a timely way, using existing reporting tools and channels. The need to scale up the monitoring of illicit drug supply in Europe is an important component of the current EU drugs strategy (2013–20). The strategy sets a priority for the EU to work towards more effective policies in the field of drug supply reduction, by reinforcing policy evaluation and analysis to improve the understanding of drug markets, drug-related crime and the effectiveness of drug-related law enforcement responses.

EMCDDA_UNK_0367	2013-11-06	UNK	CICAD–OAS Executive Secretary, Ambassador Paul E. Simons, visits EMCDDA to discuss cooperation and perspectives for work programme 2014–18	   Ambassador Paul E. Simons, Executive Secretary of the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) of the Organization of American States (OAS) visits the EMCDDA today to discuss with the agency’s Director Wolfgang Götz perspectives for the next EMCDDA–CICAD work programme (2014–18). The EMCDDA collaborates with CICAD under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in 2000 with its parent body, the Organisation of American States (OAS) (1). In the context of the MoU, the two bodies hold regular coordination meetings to fine-tune work programme activities and assess progress. During today’s visit, Ambassador Simons and Coordinator of the Inter-American Observatory on Drugs (OID) Francisco Cumsille, will also explore with Alexis Goosdeel, Head of the EMCDDA’s Reitox and international cooperation unit, possibilities for deepening relations under the EU’s Cooperation Programme between Latin America and the European Union on Drugs Policies (COPOLAD). During the talks, the visitors will evaluate the CICAD–OAS contribution to a recent COPOLAD training course, hosted by the EMCDDA, on contemporary approaches to drug monitoring (2) and prepare the ground for the next COPOLAD training activity to be held in Santiago de Chile in December 2013. This afternoon, the staff of the EMCDDA and its national focal point in Portugal, the General-Directorate for Intervention on Addictive Behaviours and Dependencies (SICAD), along with Portuguese experts in the drugs field, will hear Ambassador Simons present the findings of the Report on the drug problem in the Americas 2013. This report, released in May this year, was presented to the OAS Member States meeting in Antigua Guatemala from 4–6 June at the 43rd regular session of the OAS General Assembly (3). Totalling around 400 pages, the report is divided into two volumes: the Analytical report and the Scenarios report. The former explores the use of different drugs in the OAS countries, the effects on social exclusion and respect for human rights and the possible forms of treatment and prevention practised today. The Scenarios report, on the other hand, examines the various paths the drug phenomenon could take in the region in the coming years if different responses were followed. These alternatives are presented as four scenarios — Together, Pathways, Resilience and Disruption. Rather than policy options, the scenarios are presented as contributions to support strategic policymaking. The report is the first of its kind produced on the drugs problem throughout the region and will be used to foster dialogue on the future of the drug strategy in the Americas. On 5 November Ambassador Simons visited SICAD where he held talks with Portuguese National Drug Coordinator, Dr João Goulão.

EMCDDA_UNK_0368	2013-10-31	UNK	Wound botulism among people who inject heroin in Norway – joint ECDC/EMCDDA rapid risk assessment	 As of 28 October 2013, six cases of wound botulism have been reported in Norway among people who had injected heroin. Two cases have been confirmed through mice inoculation and four are suspected cases with laboratory results pending.  All cases reported heroin use and most reported intramuscular injection of heroin. They all reside in the Oslo area or in neighbouring municipalities. The source of infection is thought to be a batch of contaminated heroin. The geographical distribution of the potentially contaminated heroin is unknown at this time, as is the distribution stage at which the heroin may have been contaminated. The potential risk for the EU/EEA will depend on the stage of contamination. If heroin contamination occurred early in the stage of distribution, it cannot be excluded that additional wound botulism-infected heroin injectors will be identified in the EU/EEA. No person-to-person transmission has ever been reported. Guidance on drug treatment and prevention and control of infections among people who inject drugs has recently been issued by ECDC and the EMCDDA. The two agencies will continue to monitor the evolution of this situation in terms of the epidemiological information available. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/ecdc-botulism_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0369	2013-10-30	UNK	EMCDDA publications recognised by the American Library Association	 Three of the EMCDDA’s publications have recently been recognised among the ‘notable government documents 2012’ by the American Library Association (ALA). The three publications are: the EU drug markets report: a strategic analysis; Cannabis production and markets and New heroin-assisted treatment: recent evidence and current practices of supervised injectable heroin treatment in Europe and beyond. The EMCDDA was informed of this accolade on 3 September by the Notable Documents Panel of the ALA’s Government Documents Roundtable (ALA/GODORT). Publications are nominated which meet or surpass around 10 criteria. These include: the extent of lasting value and reference and bibliographic value of the publication; the degree to which the document expands knowledge or shows innovation; and the extent to which the document enhances quality of life and furthers understanding of government processes, functions or of an agency’s mission. The physical appearance, browsability, searchability and usability of the publication are also acknowledged as is its appeal to a broad audience. More information on the nomination process and selection criteria can be found on the site of the American Library Association. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/ala_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0370	2013-10-30	UNK	EMCDDA: 20 years	 It is 20 years today since the EMCDDA’s founding regulation, Council Regulation (EEC) Nº 302/93, came into effect. On 29 October 1993, the Heads of State decided that the seat of the EMCDDA would be Lisbon and the regulation entered into force the following day. Over these years, the agency has established strong mechanisms in Europe to carry out regular and sustained monitoring of developments in the field as well as to ensure rapid responses to new substances. A central challenge for the EMCDDA today is to continue to deliver high-quality analyses on established topics while, at the same time, extending its work in less developed but strategically important areas, with the same or fewer resources. As the European drug problem evolves, the agency strives to ensure that its tools and approaches keep pace with developments and remain fit for purpose. The EMCDDA’s current three-year strategy and work plan rest on the recognition that the achievements the agency has made since its inception have been delivered by maintaining clarity of purpose, technical rigour and a long-term vision. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/20years_en

The two-day event gathers over 20 experts from five candidate and potential candidate countries to the EU (1). Building on a guidance report on the same topic, published by EMCDDA and ECDC in 2011 (2), the participating experts will discuss with EMCDDA staff a range of policies and measures to prevent and control infectious diseases in this group. Special attention will be given to exploring the availability of epidemiological data and the provision of recommended prevention measures. A set of proposals will be agreed at the meeting aimed at strengthening national drug monitoring systems and reaching an adequately high coverage rate of measures to prevent and control infections in the participating countries. This Reitox Academy is the first regional event organised in cooperation with the Ministry of Civil Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It forms part of a series of training activities organised within a framework of the technical cooperation project with candidate and potential candidate countries, launched by the EMCDDA in January 2012. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/reitox-academy-preventing-controlling-infectious-diseases-among-people-who-inject-drugs_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0372	2013-10-22	UNK	EMCDDA Director opens workshop showcasing Croatia’s national drug monitoring system	 EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz will be opening a workshop today in Zadar, Croatia, in his first official visit to the country since its accession to the EU in July 2013. The two-day workshop, which focuses on Croatia’s national drug monitoring system, is being organised by the European Commission’s Technical Assistance and Information and Exchange Instrument (TAIEX), in cooperation with the EMCDDA and the Office for Combating Drug Abuse of the Government of the Republic of Croatia (Reitox national focal point). The aim of the workshop is to showcase Croatia’s achievements to date in developing its national drug information system and to increase the visibility of the EMCDDA and the national focal point in the country. The event will gather over 30 experts from across Europe.Mr Götz will open the inaugural session — ‘Why monitoring of the drug situation and related responses matters’ — with a presentation on ‘Providing the evidence base for effective policy and action’. He will be joined by member of the Croatian national parliament, Ms Lidija Bagarić who will speak on ‘The role of monitoring in modelling national drug policy: interventions responding to changes’. Following an introduction by Mr Željko Petković, Director of the Office for Combating Drug Abuse, Mr Alexis Goosdeel, EMCDDA Head of unit for Reitox and international cooperation will speak on reference frameworks for monitoring the drug situation and on issues of quality assurance. Also covered in this session will be the effectiveness of drug policy, the use of monitoring in improving responses at the local level and drug-related expenditure in Croatia. Three additional sessions will examine the: analysis and use of epidemiological data; getting to know the principles of drug markets; and ensuring evidence-based and proactive responses. Workshops — In addition to the four plenary sessions, the event will include two workshops: Workshop I, ‘Composing a puzzle’, will look at innovative approaches in monitoring the drugs phenomenon; drug-related deaths, prevalence estimates and treatment data; and cross-indicator analyses. Workshop II, ‘Defining a way forward’, will focus on the Draft action plan on national drugs information system in the Republic of Croatia (2014–15).Press conference 22 October — 12.00–13:00 Venue: Hotel PINIJA, Petrcane bb, 23231-Petrcane                         The inaugural session will be followed by a press conference presenting: new trends and challenges in the drugs field in Europe and Croatia; the launch of the 2013 national report on the drug situation in Croatia; and key findings of a Zadar-based project in the rapidly-developing scientific discipline of wastewater analysis. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/fs8_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0373	2013-09-30	UNK	EMCDDA supports national drug observatories via training on contemporary approaches to drug monitoring	 ‘Analysing, interpreting and disseminating drug-related data to facilitate decision-making’ will be the focus of an innovative training course hosted by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) this week in Lisbon. Opening today and running until 2 October, the event is a thematic twinning initiative of the EU’s Cooperation Programme between Latin America and the European Union on Drugs Policies (COPOLAD). The course is organised in close cooperation with the Portuguese General-Directorate for Intervention on Addictive Behaviours and Dependencies (SICAD) and the Inter-American Observatory on Drugs (OID) of the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission of the Organization of American States (CICAD–OAS). COPOLAD aims to improve the coherence, balance and impact of drug policies between the two regions, through the exchange of mutual experience, bi-regional coordination and the promotion of coordinated responses. The EMCDDA is a close COPOLAD partner (‘collaborating reference organisation’) along with the OID and the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO). In this context, the agency provides technical and  scientific support in its areas of expertise and participates in the project’s strategic committee. Thematic twinning events of this kind form part of a set of COPOLAD initiatives (‘component 2’) designed to strengthen the competence of national drug monitoring centres. The ultimate aim is to obtain adequate, updated, quality and comparable drug-related information which is essential for defining and evaluating drug policies at national and regional level.  Two twinning activities — on how to consolidate the monitoring of drug treatment and problem drug use in the COPOLAD participating countries — were already implemented by the EMCDDA, in cooperation with SICAD, in Costa Rica (2012) and Montevideo (2013). This week’s training will explore a comprehensive concept of monitoring the drug situation at national level using qualitative and quantitative tools and data from different sectors (e.g. health, law enforcement, research, policy). The participants will discuss challenges linked to the interpretation and dissemination of drug-related data, with the purpose of making their efforts relevant to evidence-based decision-making.  The course includes a variety of presentations from EMCDDA and EU experts (including examples of best practice from the region) and a number of working group activities to facilitate the debate. A special session will look at the way forward for strengthening national early-warning systems, a tool helping to identify new psychoactive substances and changes in drug markets in both regions. Participants will take a test at the end of the course to verify the knowledge acquired during the programme. The EMCDDA has over 20 years’ experience of working with the Reitox network of national focal points (‘drug observatories’) in Europe, now widely acknowledged across the world. In 2010, the EMCDDA and  CICAD–OAS published a joint handbook on building national drug observatories, which offers key insights into the core operational processes and strategic factors for establishing and developing these national bodies.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/fs7_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0374	2013-09-23	UNK	New-style EMCDDA expert meetings promote integrated approach to monitoring	 The first EMCDDA week on ‘Measuring, understanding and responding to drug problems in Europe’ opens today in Lisbon, gathering experts from across the European Union, as well as the Russian Federation, South Africa, the United States and international organisations. The initiative represents a new and integrated take on the usual format of the agency’s five yearly expert meetings, to date dedicated to each of the EMCDDA key epidemiological indicators (1).  This week, the agency brings together its technical work in a number of fields, namely: measuring drug problems, through the EMCDDA problem drug use indicator; understanding drug problems and treatment uptake, through the EMCDDA treatment demand indicator;  monitoring health and social responses to drug problems. The aim of the initiative is to inspire cross-discipline analyses of the drugs problem and responses to it. Through the event, the agency also intends to obtain greater value from these annual meetings, strengthening what have become over the last 10 years valuable networks of excellence. The initiative is the agency’s first treatment-related meeting since the adoption last year of a new EMCDDA strategy on treatment data collection and analyses (2). This strategy seeks to improve the value of the agency’s data collection for national health policymakers and treatment programme managers who wish to shape or expand the treatment offer in their country. The strategy reflects the scaling up and growing integration of treatment and other health and social responses to drug use witnessed in Europe over the last decade. During the week, discussions will address the use of data to determine treatment need and coverage. Talks will also focus on better understanding problem drug users by looking at clients admitted to drug treatment services and documenting new trends in drug use. At the end of the week, sessions will be dedicated to the agency’s work on estimating the number of problem drug users in Europe. Here national analyses of the prevalence and incidence of high-risk drug use will be discussed and innovative monitoring methods explored. Commenting today EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘It is high time for us to integrate our work on the epidemiological key indicators with that on interventions and policy issues. National decision-makers are currently faced with difficult choices and competing priorities. In such times, it is more important than ever that investments are based on a sound understanding of the drugs problem and of the measures that will deliver the greatest benefits. I hope that the discussions this week will help further develop our knowledge and make the best use of our data in order to provide policymakers with relevant information for sound decision-making’.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/fs6_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0375	2013-09-17	UNK	EMCDDA welcomes European Commission call for stronger EU action on new drugs	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) welcomes the European Commission's proposal today to strengthen the EU’s response to new psychoactive substances (‘new drugs’)(1). The proposal follows an unprecedented rise in the number of new drugs detected in Europe in recent years and a Commission review of the EU’s current legal mechanism for monitoring and acting on these new substances (2). With the aim of building on the strengths of the current mechanism, addressing its shortcomings and speeding up common EU responses, the Commission proposes a:  Regulation on new psychoactive substances, repealing and replacing Council Decision 2005/387/JHA of 10 May 2005 on the monitoring, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances; and a Directive amending Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA of 25 October 2004 laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking (3). Before becoming law, the Commission proposals will need to be adopted by the European Parliament and by the Council of the European Union. ‘It is widely recognised that the current EU early-warning system, implemented by the EMCDDA and Europol, has provided Europe with a globally unique tool to keep pace with the new drugs phenomenon’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘Nevertheless, the unprecedented rise in the number, type and availability of new drugs in recent years clearly requires us to strengthen further our early-warning and response capacity. We warmly welcome the European Commission’s call today for stronger action on new drugs, which we see as both timely and important. The EMCDDA remains committed to working with the Commission, Europol and the Member States to rise to what has become a policy challenge of major international concern.’ The EU early-warning system (EWS), which operates under the existing legislation, currently monitors over 300 new psychoactive substances. 73 new psychoactive substances were detected in the EU in 2012, significantly up from 49 in 2011 and 41 in 2010 (4). This rise has been driven by technological advancement and globalisation, with the internet playing a significant role. A thriving ‘legal highs’ market, both online and in ‘head shops’ in urban areas, has marked a fundamental shift in the drug market. ‘Monitoring new drugs is not only about counting numbers, but also about identifying and understanding the harms they can cause and ensuring that prompt action is taken to protect public health when required’, says Götz. The harms associated with some of these substances have been significant, including deaths reported in some cases (e.g. 5-IT and 4-MA)(5). The relative ease with which new drugs can be obtained, our lack of understanding of their health consequences and the ability of producers to react quickly to control measures make them a growing challenge to public health, law enforcement and drug policymaking. The EMCDDA and Europol — with the support of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Commission — have been working together since 1997 to monitor the appearance of new drugs and the extent of their diffusion on the European drug scene. The first (1997), and the existing (2005), legislative frameworks (6) have allowed the partners to develop an advanced early-warning system for monitoring new drugs and a structure for performing scientific risk assessments. Importantly, it has also provided the EU with a mechanism to react promptly when necessary to this challenge. In total, 13 risk assessments have been conducted under the system, leading to the introduction of control measures across the EU in nine cases (7). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/11_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0376	2013-09-12	UNK	Experts to examine latest scientific research in the field of new drugs	 Novel (or new) psychoactive substances (NPS) are an ever-increasing group of synthetic, semi-synthetic or natural compounds, often advertised and sold as ‘legal’ alternatives to illicit drugs. Often misrepresented as ‘safe’ for recreational use, they can, however, prove as harmful as controlled drugs. International experts convene in Swansea (UK) today to examine the latest scientific research in this rapidly-changing field. The Second international conference on novel psychoactive substances is hosted by the College of Human and Health Sciences at Swansea University, in collaboration with Hertfordshire University and the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA).The event follows on from the First international conference on novel psychoactive substances held in Budapest in March 2012. It is designed to be of interest to educators, health professionals, youth workers, policymakers and anyone involved in the prevention and treatment of drug addiction. Conference website One of the defining features of NPS is that they are not controlled under the international drug treaties, although a number of countries have introduced measures to control some of these substances. While they may have similar effects to those caused by chemically-related controlled substances, they may also be associated with significantly different or unexpected effects. Today, members of the public can buy these substances easily online. Furthermore, when control measures are introduced, vendors rapidly react by promoting alternative new compounds and products. The two-day conference aims to explore various scientific issues related to NPS, a subject about which still relatively little is known. The event will contribute, among others, to: Conference programme providing accurate, evidence-based information on NPS; improving understanding of how NPS can be ‘designed’; exploring NPS by analogy with better studied substances; discussing both the acute and chronic clinical effects of NPS use; highlighting some of the issues with toxicological screening for NPS; improving knowledge of NPS pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics; improving understanding of treatment and management approaches for patients with levels of clinical and/or behavioural toxicity associated with NPS use; and informing future research in e-health, selective prevention and harm reduction, using technological tools. Three EMCDDA experts will participate in the event as speakers and scientific advisers: Paul Griffiths, Scientific Director Dr Roumen Sedefov, Head of unit, Supply reduction and new trends Dr Ana Gallegos, Head of sector, Action on new drugs See speaker profiles here: www.novelpsychoactivesubstances.org/keynotespeakers. The EU early-warning system, operated by the EMCDDA and Europol, currently monitors over 300 new psychoactive substances. In 2012, 73 new substances were officially notified for the first time in the EU through the system, up from 49 in 2011, 41 in 2010 and 24 in 2009.

EMCDDA_UNK_0377	2013-07-16	UNK	European Parliament LIBE Committee members on fact-finding visit to EMCDDA	 Members of the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) will visit the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) on 18 and 19 July where they will meet Director Wolfgang Götz and staff and hear why a sound evidence base is essential for effective policymaking and action in the drugs field. The visiting delegation will be composed of LIBE members Ioan Enciu (Romania, Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats) as well as Marco Scurria (Italy) and Carlos Coelho (Portugal), both of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats). Accompanying the LIBE delegates will be Barbara Dürhkop Dürhkop (Spain) and Carla Rossi (Italy), members of the EMCDDA Management Board designated by the European Parliament. João Goulão, Chairman of the EMCDDA Management Board, will also attend. During the visit, the members will be presented with the findings of the 2013 European Drug Report and with updates on the agency’s work in the areas of: new drugs; monitoring supply and supply reduction; best practice and international cooperation. The EMCDDA has close working relationships with the European Parliament, mainly through the LIBE Committee, for content-related aspects, and through the Committees on Budgets (COBU) and Budgetary Control (CONT), for budgetary matters. The LIBE Committee is responsible for most of the legislation and democratic oversight for policies linked to the transformation of the European Union in the area of freedom, security and justice. Every year, the agency presents its European Drug Report, General Report of Activities and work programme to the European Parliament at the LIBE Committee meeting. This week’s visit will also include discussions on: cooperation between the EMCDDA and the European Parliament; the implementation of a joint statement of the European Parliament, the Council of the EU and European Commission on decentralised agencies (2012); and cooperation between EU agencies active in the area of justice and home affairs (in particular CEPOL, EMCDDA, Eurojust, Europol, FRA and Frontex).   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/fs4_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0378	2013-06-27	UNK	Speech by Wolfgang Götz, EMCDDA Director at the Third international multi-disciplinary forum on new drugs	 It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you to the Third international multidisciplinary forum on new drugs. I am really glad to see such an impressive audience of European and international participants. This forum — which has been organised by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), in cooperation with the EU law enforcement agency (Europol) — takes place in conjunction with the 13th Annual meeting of the Reitox early warning system (EWS) network and the Europol second law-enforcement meeting on new psychoactive substances. Yesterday we celebrated International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking. The slogan chosen by the United Nations for this year was: Make health your 'new high' in life, not drugs. Marking the day, the UNODC launched its World drug report 2013, which, this year, has a strong focus on new psychoactive substances. As you are aware, the issue of new psychoactive substances has been at the heart of the EMCDDA’s work for some years already. Since 1997, we have been running, with Europol, the EU early warning system for monitoring new psychoactive substances. This system provides the EU Member States with an information-exchange mechanism for reporting on, and responding to, the emergence of new drugs. It was recently acknowledged as best practice, both in a resolution of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) and in a G8 statement on illicit drugs. Today, we have with us at the forum, around 110 international experts from both academic and operational backgrounds and from a wide range of disciplines, including: epidemiology, forensic science, healthcare, law enforcement, criminology and policy. We have representatives from the 30 EMCDDA member countries, as well as from Australia, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland, Ukraine and the USA; Other participants include representatives from: Europol, the European Medicines Agency (EMA); the European Commission; the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC); and the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB). This third forum, beginning today, will build on the results of the first forum, which the EMCDDA organised in Lisbon in 2011, and the second, co-organised by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the EMCDDA in Palm Springs in 2012. These events focused on the growing global nature of the phenomenon and the importance of international cooperation in responding to the issue. Only a few years ago, new drugs were generally regarded as being of limited significance to drug policy. The continued growth of the market, however — particularly the ‘legal highs’ phenomenon — has seen the issue develop into a complex policy challenge that is now of major international concern. Around one new drug a week is detected in the EU and reported to the EWS. We are seeing the development of a dynamic new market, with considerable effort being invested in identifying substances that can be used as alternatives to controlled drugs. These substances are packaged and marketed with a degree of sophistication, often sold via the Internet, and are growing in popularity in various parts of the world. Many of these chemicals are difficult to detect and are highly active, meaning that a small-volume package can contain many thousands of doses. This market growth has been driven by entrepreneurs who have exploited gaps in drug regulation. It has also been fuelled by the increasingly globalised and interconnected world in which we live. As a result of this, we are now seeing an unprecedented growth in the number, type and availability of new drugs, a growing interplay between the new drugs and illicit drug markets and a greater involvement of organised crime. Significant developments in the field of new drugs have seen it evolve into a complex challenge for scientists, law enforcers and policymakers. This year, due to the significant increase in the number of new drugs detected in the EU, the forum will: focus on methods and mechanisms to monitor new substances, emerging trends and pioneering legislative approaches; identify information gaps and research needs; anticipate future developments and challenges; explore the role that can be played by law enforcement; and explore the added value that can be provided by coordinated efforts. I wish you a fruitful meeting and an enjoyable stay in Lisbon. Thank you   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/speeches/NewDrugsForum_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0379	2013-06-26	UNK	New EMCDDA report reveals how a better understanding of the science of ‘addiction’ can improve our response to drug problems	 Addiction is a global issue that costs many millions of lives each year and causes untold suffering. In a new report, released today to mark International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking, the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) looks at how far the science of addiction has come and how this knowledge can be used to help tackle the problem (1). Designed to encourage debate and promote understanding of the concept, Models of addiction provides a critical review of existing addiction theories and explores how these can be organised into an overarching structure to inform how we assess, prevent and treat addictive behaviours. This model is not limited to the traditional illicit drugs of abuse, but also covers alcohol and tobacco use and even non-pharmacological addictions, such as gambling or compulsive use of the Internet.  The new EMCDDA report shows that there is no single model of addiction but competing perspectives sharing common elements. With this peer-reviewed analysis, the agency supports drug policy by providing a broad definition of the term, covering substance-based and behavioural addiction and reflecting current scientific developments. The definition of addiction adopted in the report is: ‘a repeated powerful motivation to engage in a particular behaviour, acquired through enacting the behaviour with a potential risk of significant harm’. An essential take-home message from the analysis is that, whilst there are advantages to be drawn from our growing understanding of the biological basis of addiction (e.g. ‘brain disease’ model), it is not helpful to be over reductive. The report argues that understanding the broader social and psychological aspects of addictive behaviour can also be important for successful prevention and treatment responses. It provides a basis for a more comprehensive and structured approach to developing responses and highlights the need to draw on a pool of interventions (education, persuasion, coercion, training). Commenting on the issue, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘Addiction continues to be one of the key concepts in the scientific and policy debate around drug use and interventions, and lies at the very heart of the responsibilities of this agency. A better understanding of this complex concept not only informs our monitoring of those in need of help with drug problems, but also how we design and implement effective responses’. Götz adds: ‘Addiction is a multifaceted issue that does not stop at substance-based problems but can also include phenomena such as gambling or compulsive use of the Internet. Indeed we are seeing a number of European countries establishing centres of addiction that potentially cover the full range of addictive behaviours. In future, we need to undertake a broader analysis of addictive behaviours, than is usually undertaken, to allow for the development of more effective intervention strategies. This report raises key questions, such as whether we should continue to monitor addictive use by substance, as at present, or at a more general level’. Notes (1) Models of addiction, EMCDDA Insights International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking: The EMCDDA marks this International day with an event at its premises for the Lisbon diplomatic community and its partners from the Portuguese authorities. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime will be launching its 2013 World drug report and promoting the theme ‘Make health your ‘new high’ in life, not drugs’.

EMCDDA_UNK_0380	2013-06-26	UNK	Speech by Wolfgang Götz, EMCDDA Director	 Dear Ambassadors and members of the Lisbon diplomatic community Dear Representatives of the Portuguese authorities Ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues and friends It is my great pleasure to welcome you today, together with the Chairman of the EMCDDA Management Board Dr João Goulão, to this reception celebrating International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking. I am really glad to see, that this year again, you — the diplomatic community in Lisbon, our partners from the Portuguese authorities and the EU bodies in Portugal — have joined us in large numbers. International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking was established by the United Nations in 1987 to strengthen action and cooperation in tackling the drugs problem and in creating safer and healthier societies across the world. The slogan chosen by the United Nations for this year is: Make health your 'new high' in life, not drugs. Marking the day, the UNODC launches at the same time as our gathering here its World drug report 2013, which, this year, has quite a strong focus on new psychoactive substances. As most of you are aware, the issue of new psychoactive substances has been at the heart of the EMCDDA’s work for some years already. Last year alone, a total of 73 new psychoactive substances were officially notified via the EU early warning system that we run with Europol. This early warning system was recently acknowledged in a G8 statement of intent on collecting and sharing data on new psychoactive substances. This week (27–28 June), we are co-hosting with Europol — here at the newly named ‘Praça Europa’ — the Third international multidisciplinary forum on new drugs. In this forum we will bring together over 100 international experts representing a wide range of disciplines (e.g. epidemiology, forensic science, healthcare, law enforcement, criminology and policy). We will have representatives from the 30 EMCDDA member countries, as well as from Australia, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland, Ukraine and the USA.And we will have representatives from: Europol, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Commission, as well as from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB). This Third forum will build on the results of the first forum, which the EMCDDA organised in Lisbon in 2011, and the second, co-organised with the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the EMCDDA in Palm Springs in 2012. Almost half of the year is over and I must say that up until now, 2013 has been a particularly challenging one for the EMCDDA. Let me just mention a few of the highlights: With the entry into force of the EU drugs strategy for 2013–2020, we are playing an even more central role in monitoring and evaluating the drugs problem at EU level. At the beginning of the year, we launched with Europol the first strategic analysis of European drug markets. This publication combines Europol’s strategic and operational understanding of trends and developments in organised crime with the EMCDDA’s ongoing monitoring and analysis of the drug situation in Europe and beyond. Last month, we presented the European Drug Report: Trends and developments. This new report now comes out some five months earlier than our previous annual report. It has a strong focus on graphics and it is accompanied by a number of online topic-based publications and statistics. From the European Drug Report, you can learn that for many of the drugs that have defined the drugs problem over the last couple of decades — such as heroin, cocaine and cannabis — the situation is stable or even declining. You can also find detailed information about the increasing complexity and escalating dynamics that we are confronted with regarding stimulants and new psychoactive substances. And today, we are launching a new report, Models of addiction, which covers not only substance-based addictions but also behavioural ones such as gambling or compulsive use of the Internet. Ladies and gentlemen, Before I conclude, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the new Director of EMSA Markku Mylly, who is at this event for the first time, for the breath of fresh air he has given to the cooperation between our two EU agencies. And I would also like to acknowledge once again the constant support we receive from the Portuguese authorities — in particular the Parliament, Government, the Municipality of Lisbon and the Lisbon Port Authority — and the productive working relationship we have forged with them. Not wishing to go into more detail here, I cannot avoid mentioning the administrative services of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Finance — their continuing support contributes significantly to facilitating our work. Thank you.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/speeches/26June_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0381	2013-06-25	UNK	G8 statement of intent on collecting and sharing of data on new drugs	 New psychoactive substances (NPS) have changed the nature of the global drugs market. Substances that are not under international control, but mimic the effects of controlled substances, are now widely available. NPS also have the potential to pose serious risks to public health and safety. Despite often being marketed as legal alternatives to controlled substances, users can have no certainty of the health risks that will arise from using them, nor the legal status of these substances. The UK has taken the opportunity of its one-year presidency of the G8 to lead on tackling the threat of new psychoactive substances. The G8 Member States, the UN and the EU are committed to working together to develop a better understanding of NPS, and are committed to reducing the production, manufacture, distribution and demand for NPS. There is no standard national or international approach to NPS. Many countries have adopted broader legislative approaches for controlling NPS through the use of analogue and generic terms, temporary and emergency procedures and alternative non-drug specific legislation, such as consumer protection legislation. In a written statement to the UK Parliament today, Minister of State for Crime Prevention Jeremy Browne said: ‘The sharing of information among international partners on the emergence of new substances, their impact on public health and the supply routes is invaluable in addressing the challenge. I am pleased to inform Parliament that the G8 have agreed a Statement of Intent to progress our close joint working on this.’   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/G8-statement_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0382	2013-06-24	UNK	Over 100 specialists from across the globe to review international developments in new drugs field	 Leading European and international specialists will meet in Lisbon from 27–28 June to take stock of the global new drugs phenomenon. The Third international multidisciplinary forum on new drugs, organised by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), in cooperation with Europol, will gather over 100 participants from some 40 countries (1). The event will build on the results of the Second interdisciplinary forum on new and emerging psychoactive substances, co-hosted by the EMCDDA and NIDA in Palm Springs in June 2012, and the First international multidisciplinary forum on new drugs, organised by the EMCDDA in Lisbon in May 2011. These events focused on the growing global nature of the phenomenon and the importance of international cooperation in responding to the issue (2). Commenting ahead of this year’s forum, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘Only a few years ago, new drugs were generally regarded as being of limited significance to drug policy. The continued growth of the market, however — particularly driven by “legal highs” — has seen the issue develop into a complex policy challenge that is now of major international concern’. Götz adds: ‘This growth has been driven by entrepreneurs who have exploited gaps in drug regulation. It has also been fuelled by the increasingly globalised and interconnected world in which we live. We are now seeing an unprecedented growth in the number, type and availability of new drugs, the growing interplay between the new drugs and illicit drug markets and a greater involvement of organised crime’. The EU Early warning system (EWS) for monitoring new psychoactive substances — operated by the EMCDDA and Europol and active since 1997 — ensures that Europe continues to be at the forefront of this rapidly changing field (3). Significant developments since the 2011 forum have seen the issue evolve into a complex challenge for scientists, law enforcers and policymakers. This year, experts have been invited to discuss latest developments in six thematic sessions: New drugs: the big picture — historical context, public health perspective, motivations of users,          the role of law enforcement, challenges for drug policy National, regional and global perspectives on new drugs — presentations on significant developments and initiatives taking place around the globe Detecting, monitoring and understanding the emerging harms of new drugs — updates from forensic science, toxicology and healthcare disciplines The only constant is change: law enforcement and new drugs — growing interplay between the new drugs and illicit drug markets; law-enforcement initiatives Reading the signals: keeping a finger on the pulse of new drugs — good practice, novel approaches, what we can learn from the users of new drugs The response to new drugs: fit for purpose? — with a focus on the experience of, and topical developments in, New Zealand; input from subject experts and open forum. The forum will aim to identify information gaps and research needs, anticipate future developments and challenges and explore the role that can be played by law enforcement. The EWS now monitors over 300 new psychoactive substances. In 2012, 73 new substances were officially notified for the first time in the EU through the system, up from 49 in 2011, 41 in 2010 and 24 in 2009 (4). This year’s forum will focus on innovative methods and mechanisms to monitor new substances and emerging trends and on responses to the phenomenon. International speakers will present updates on state-of-the-art developments and explore the added value of coordinating efforts. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial to understanding and responding to the new drugs phenomenon in order to protect public health, which is at the very heart of this issue. The participating experts represent a wide range of disciplines, from both academic and operational backgrounds, including: epidemiology, forensic science, healthcare, law-enforcement, criminology and policy. Also participating are staff from the European Commission, the European Medicines Agency and international bodies. The forum is organised in conjunction with the 13th annual meeting of the Reitox early warning system (EWS) network and the Europol second law-enforcement meeting on new psychoactive substances. The conference is closed to the media but experts will be available for comment via requests to the EMCDDA press office (Tel. 351 211 21 02 40) on Friday 28 June. The forum conclusions will be available in the days following the event. Full event details and programme available.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/9_en

The square will be inaugurated by President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz and Mayor of Lisbon António Costa, following a ceremony at the Lisbon Town Hall at which Mr Schulz will receive the keys to the city. The plaques of the newly-designated square will be unveiled at 12.45 by President Schulz and Mayor Costa as well as by EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz and EMSA Director Markku Mylly. Interested members of the public are invited to drop in to the two agencies on that day and gain an insight into their work through presentations, videos, publications, quizzes and conversations with staff. Date: Thursday 20 June Opening hours: 10.30 to 16.30 Venue: EMCDDA and EMSA, Praça Europa, Cais do Sodré, 1249-289 The EMCDDA was set up in 1993 and inaugurated in Lisbon in 1995. It provides the EU and its Member States with ‘factual, objective, reliable and comparable information concerning drugs, drug addiction and their consequences’. With around 100 employees, it offers national and European policymakers the data they need for drawing up informed drug laws and strategies. It also helps professionals and practitioners working in the field pinpoint best practice and new areas of research. EMSA provides technical assistance and support to the European Commission and Member States in the development and implementation of EU legislation on maritime safety, pollution by ships and maritime security. It has also been given operational tasks in the field of oil pollution response, vessel monitoring and in long range identification and tracking of vessels. Set up in 2002, EMSA has been established in Lisbon since 2006 and has over 200 employees. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/8_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0384	2013-05-28	UNK	New drugs cause fundamental shift in Europe’s drug market	 The number, type and availability of new drugs in Europe continued to increase in 2012, according to a report released today by the EMCDDA and Europol (1). Driven by globalisation, technological advancement and the Internet, an open market for new drugs has now developed which presents significant challenges to public health, law enforcement and policymaking. Until around 10 years ago, most new psychoactive substances appearing on the European drug scene were produced in underground laboratories or sourced from diverted medicines and sold directly on the illicit drug market. While this still occurs, the emergence of a thriving ‘legal highs’ business on the Internet and in specialised shops in urban areas has marked a fundamental shift in the drug market. Today, these substances, often produced in China and India, are now imported into Europe in bulk where they are processed, packaged and sold as 'legal highs'. They may also end up on the street where they are sold as substitutes for amphetamine, ecstasy, heroin or cocaine. Seventy-three (73) new psychoactive substances were officially notified for the first time in 2012 via the EU Early warning system (EWS) (2). This continues the upward trend of substances reported in a single year: from 49 in 2011, 41 in 2010 and 24 in 2009. In 2012, the list of substances reported was dominated by 30 synthetic cannabinoids, which mimic the effects of cannabis (3). Over 280 new psychoactive substances are currently monitored by the EWS, the number of substances notified in the last two years accounting for over half of the total number reported since 2005. Via the EWS, the agencies collect and analyse information on all of these substances, allowing them to identify harms, assess the extent of involvement of organised crime and ensure prompt action, when necessary, to protect public health. Such information, provided by the EU Member States, led to risk assessments of two very different substances in 2012 which were linked to over 40 deaths in Europe. The first, 4-MA (a stimulant) was being sold as amphetamine on the illicit market, while the second, 5-IT (reported to have both stimulant and hallucinogenic effects), was being sold both on the ‘legal high’ and illicit market (4). In addition to the risk assessments, the EMCDDA issued a number of public health alerts to the EWS network in 2012, highlighting harms related both to new substances and controlled drugs. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘Monitoring new drugs is about more than just counting numbers. This report clearly demonstrates that the early warning system plays an essential role in ensuring that the EU and the Member States have access to state-of-the-art information on new psychoactive substances including the harms that they may cause. This helps ensure that, across the Union, appropriate action can be taken to protect public health’. According to the report, now more than ever it is essential to provide up-to-date and scientifically robust information on new substances from across Europe and beyond. While the EWS has continued to expand its operational capacity, the report highlights inherent difficulties in monitoring this emerging drug market, such as identifying increasingly complex new substances and interpreting limited data on levels of use. Europol Director Rob Wainwright says: ‘The new drugs phenomenon is now recognised to be a global issue and a globalised market, which makes it particularly difficult to control. The report shows that organised crime is involved in the production of new drugs, a rapidly developing and expanding market with low risks and high profits’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/5_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0385	2013-05-28	UNK	New European drug report out today — Europe’s drugs problem in ‘state of flux’	 Europe’s drugs problem is in a ‘state of flux’, with new threats emerging that challenge current models of policy and practice. This is according to the European Drug Report 2013: Trends and developments, published today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in Lisbon (1).  In its annual review, the agency describes positive developments in relation to the more established drugs, such as fewer new users of heroin, less injecting and declining use of cannabis and cocaine in some countries. But these are offset by concerns over synthetic stimulants and new psychoactive substances, offered both on the illicit, and so-called ‘legal highs’, market. Also highlighted in today’s report is a drug market that is ‘more fluid and dynamic’ and ‘less structured around plant-based substances shipped over long distances to consumer markets in Europe’. Here globalisation             and information technology are important drivers of change, with the Internet creating new connections in drug use and supply. European Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmström says: ‘I am both encouraged and concerned by the findings in the EMCDDA’s European Drug Report 2013. I am encouraged by the fact that, thanks to robust drug policies and record levels of treatment, use of heroin, cocaine and cannabis appears to be waning in some countries and drug-related HIV continues to decline. But I am also concerned that a quarter of European adults — or 85 million people — have used an illicit drug and that, by historical standards, drug use in Europe remains high. Emerging challenges add to my concerns — we are faced with an ever more complex stimulant market and a relentless supply of new drugs which are increasingly diverse. The fact that over 70 new drugs have been detected in the last year is proof in itself that drug policies need to adapt to changing drug markets’. ‘Signs that current policies have found traction in some important areas must be viewed in the light of a drugs problem that never stands still’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘We will need to continue to adjust our current practices if they are to remain relevant to emerging trends and patterns of use in both new drugs and old. The new EU drugs strategy 2013–20 will need to address a drugs problem in a state of flux and a dynamic and rapidly-evolving drugs market. I believe that this report provides a valuable resource for responding to the challenges that lie ahead’. The main findings of the report in relation to different substances are set out below. Cannabis: a robust and diverse market, concerns over high-risk use, rising demand for treatment An estimated 77 million European adults (15–64 years) have tried cannabis in their lifetime; around 20 million reporting to have used it in the last year. Despite national differences, recent survey data suggest overall stable or decreasing trends in use (Figure 2.2). Nevertheless, today’s report notes that cannabis use remains high by historical standards and that a ‘large and relatively robust market’ exists for this substance, with a greater diversity of cannabis products available. Latest data show how herbal cannabis (‘marijuana’), sometimes of high potency, is becoming more common in Europe, with almost all of the EMCDDA countries now reporting some domestic cultivation of this product.     Over the past 10 years, the number of seizures of herbal cannabis in Europe has overtaken that of resin and now represents more than half of all cannabis seizures (Figure 1.3). And in 2011, herbal cannabis accounted for 41% of all drug seizures in Europe, while cannabis resin accounted for 36% (Figure 1.1).  Trends in cannabis consumption need to be viewed alongside different patterns of use, says the EMCDDA, with public health concerns greatest for the estimated 3 million Europeans (15–64 years) who use the drug on a daily, or almost daily, basis (around 1% of European adults). Europe has seen the numbers of clients entering treatment for the first time for cannabis problems rise by around one third in recent years, from an estimated 45 000 reported in 2006 to 60 000 in 2011, making cannabis now the most frequently mentioned drug among first-time clients. A new analysis released today (see ‘Perspectives on drugs’/POD) looks at the characteristics of frequent and high-risk cannabis users and reflects on how examination of this group can help design adequate responses for those most at risk. Heroin — evidence of declining use and supply Today’s report describes how latest data on demand for treatment and on seizures point to a downward trend in the use and availability of heroin. Across Europe, the number of those entering specialist drug treatment for the first time for heroin problems fell from a peak of 59 000 in 2007 to 41 000 in 2011, with reductions most apparent in western European countries. Understanding heroin use trends is a priority due to the public health impact of this drug. A new analysis of long-term trends in heroin use is released today (see POD) and confirms a decrease in first-time demand for treatment for heroin use over the last decade. Data from treatment clients also continue to show a decline in injecting the drug. The EMCDDA reports that between 2006 and 2011, there was an ‘overall decrease in the proportion of injectors among heroin clients entering drug treatment for the first time’. Along with the impact of interventions (e.g. substitution treatment) this fall in injecting is likely to have contributed to the decline in new drug-related HIV infections in Europe. But recent HIV outbreaks in Greece and Romania have interrupted this positive trend, underlining the need to provide adequate harm-reduction and treatment services (Figure 2.10). Latest figures on seizures reveal that the quantity of heroin seized in the EU and Norway in 2011 (6.1 tonnes) was the lowest reported in the last decade and equivalent to about half the quantity seized in 2001 (12 tonnes). (Substantial declines in quantities seized are reported by Turkey — Figure 1.5). The number of seizures reported in this period also fell, from 63 000 in 2001 to an estimated 40 500 in 2011. Cocaine — use and seizures down, trafficking routes diversifying Over the last decade, cocaine has established itself as the most commonly used illicit stimulant drug in Europe, although most users are found in a small number of western EU countries. Around 14.5 million Europeans (15–64 years) have tried cocaine in their lifetime; around 3.5 million reporting to have used it in the last year. But today’s report shows that, overall, cocaine use and supply are now both trending downwards. While some countries still report rises in estimated cocaine consumption, recent surveys show signs of falling use among young adults (15–34 years) in the five highest-prevalence countries (Denmark, Ireland, Spain, Italy and UK) (Figure 2.4). And fewer drug users are seeking treatment for cocaine problems. The number of clients reported to be entering treatment for primary cocaine use for the first time fell from 37 000 in 2009 to 31 000 in 2011. Yet acute and chronic problems related to cocaine use continue to be reported. Emergency health consequences of cocaine use come under the spotlight in a new EMCDDA analysis today (see POD), which explores the potential of using hospital emergency data to monitor acute problems linked to the drug. At least  475 deaths related to cocaine were recorded in 2011, although this may be an underestimate. On the supply side, dramatic decreases are reported in the quantity of cocaine seized (Figure 1.7). In 2011, 62 tonnes of the drug were intercepted, an almost 50% drop from the 120 tonnes of cocaine seized in the peak year 2006. The number of cocaine seizures has also fallen from a peak of 100 000 in 2008 to 86 000 in 2011 (Figure 1.7). The drop in the volume seized has been particularly noticeable in the Iberian Peninsula where the total quantity of cocaine intercepted by Spain and Portugal fell from 84 tonnes in 2006 to 20 tonnes in 2011.   But recent signs of diversification of cocaine trafficking routes into Europe — including large individual seizures in ports in Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and the Baltic countries — raise concerns over further diffusion of use. Synthetic stimulants — growing importance, new challenges According to today’s report: ‘Understanding overall trends in the use of synthetic stimulant drugs is complicated by the fact that they are often substituted for each other, as consumers make choices influenced by availability, price and perceived quality’. Amphetamines and ecstasy remain the most commonly used synthetic stimulants in Europe, competing to some extent with cocaine. Around 12.7 million Europeans (15–64 years) are estimated to have tried amphetamines in their lifetime (a term encompassing amphetamine and methamphetamine), around 2 million reporting to have used them in the last year. Recent data show use of amphetamines to be stable or declining among young adults (Figure 2.5). Of the two drugs, amphetamine has been more common in Europe, but there are now signs of rising availability and use of methamphetamine. Methamphetamine seizures, although still small both in number and quantity, rose between 2002 and 2011, suggesting increased availability of the drug (Figure 1.11). (Amphetamine seizures in 2011 returned to levels found in 2002 — Figure 1.10). And methamphetamine use, historically low in Europe and mainly limited to the Czech Republic and Slovakia, now appears to be spreading, with indications of problem use noted in Germany, Greece, Cyprus and Turkey. An estimated 11.4 million Europeans (15–64 years) have tried ‘ecstasy’ (MDMA) in their lifetime, around 2 million reporting to have used it in the last year. In recent years, the popularity of this drug appears to have declined, probably reflecting the poor ‘quality’ (purity or MDMA content) of tablets sold as ‘ecstasy’. This appears now to be changing, with some evidence that greater MDMA availability is encouraging renewed interest in this drug. Synthetic drug production is examined today in a new EMCDDA analysis (see POD). This looks at the main producing areas in Europe, the precursors and pre-precursors used to make synthetic drugs and current trends in production. The POD shows that ‘the most serious challenge now facing law enforcement in amphetamine and methamphetamine manufacturing countries’ relates to the chemical alpha-phenylacetoacetonitrile (APAAN), a precursor of BMK (the chemical precursor used to make amphetamine and methamphetamine). Since 2009, a large number of APAAN shipments totalling dozens of tonnes have been seized or stopped in Europe. This chemical is now placed on the European Commission’s voluntary monitoring list as a substance known to be used to manufacture synthetic drugs, but is not placed under international control.  New drugs — a fast moving market, substances more diverse, concerns over ‘synthetic cannabis’ In 2012, 73 new psychoactive substances were officially notified for the first time via the EU Early warning system (EWS) (Figure 1.14). Of these substances, 30 were synthetic cannabinoids, which mimic the effects of cannabis. ‘These products, which can be extremely potent, have now been reported in virtually all European countries’, says the report. A new EMCDDA analysis out today (see POD), provides an update on the current knowledge on these substances, which now represent the largest group of compounds monitored by the EWS. The POD explores new trends in this area including: the emergence of resinous products containing these substances; the presence of these chemicals in samples of herbal cannabis; and their detection in mixtures containing other, unrelated chemicals (e.g. tryptamines, synthetic cathinones). Of the other compounds detected in 2012, 19 substances were from ‘less known or more obscure chemical groups’. Also of note were the 14 new substituted phenethylamines (the chemical group that includes amphetamine and 'ecstasy'), the highest number reported since 2005. A full annual review of the work of the EU Early warning system on new drugs — released today by the EMCDDA and Europol (see news release 5/2013) — shows that there is no sign of a slowing down in the number of new drugs being reported in Europe. The agencies stress, however, that monitoring new drugs is not only about ‘counting numbers’, but also about informing on the harms they can cause and ensuring that prompt action is taken to protect public health when required.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/6_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0386	2013-05-28	UNK	Record levels of treatment, but still a need to invest in new interventions and social reintegration	 Record levels of treatment provision for Europe’s drug users are among the positive changes seen in the current European drug landscape, according to the European Drug Report 2013: Trends and developments published today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in Lisbon. Yet, the agency warns that considerable challenges remain for treatment services. Although the number of heroin users entering treatment for the first time continues to fall, the long-term nature of heroin problems means that many of these users will remain in need of help for years to come. And the agency underlines that, with a large number of drug users now in contact with services, there is a growing need to focus on continuity of care, social reintegration and building consensus on what constitute realistic, long-term outcomes for recovery. Among the issues highlighted today is the need to invest in new interventions, such as those developed to treat hepatitis C and prevent overdose. A strong message from the report is that drug treatment is likely to be a cost-effective policy option, even at a time of economic austerity. The EMCDDA estimates that at least 1.2 million Europeans received treatment for illicit drug use in 2011.  Opioid users represent the largest group undergoing treatment, followed by cannabis and cocaine users (Figure 3.5). Substitution treatment remains the ‘first choice’ for treating opioid dependence, says the agency. Some 730 000 Europeans now receive this type of treatment — up from 650 000 in 2008 — representing around half of the estimated 1.4 million problem opioid users in Europe today (see Chapter 3). Psychosocial interventions and detoxification are the other main forms of drug treatment provided. ‘With Europe still facing negative economic growth, increasing unemployment rates and reductions in government spending, available budgets for health, public order and safety measures run the risk of being affected’, says Chairman of the EMCDDA Management Board João Goulão. ‘We are already receiving reports from a number of European countries of cuts in drug-related services. We need to reinforce the message that drug treatment remains the most cost-effective policy option, even in difficult economic times’. Four areas requiring increased attention are highlighted in the report: Hepatitis C ‘Europe’s hidden epidemic’: large health burden, but uptake to treatment still low Transmitted through the sharing of needles, syringes and other injecting equipment, hepatitis C is the most common infectious disease among injecting drug users (IDUs) in Europe today, with national samples of IDUs showing between 18% and 80% infected with the virus (HCV)(Figure 2.11). Often known as the ‘hidden epidemic’, hepatitis C infection can go for long periods undiagnosed, with many of those infected showing either mild or no symptoms for 20 years or more. Unlike hepatitis B, hepatitis C has no vaccine, yet the disease is preventable, says the EMCDDA. In a special focus on treating hepatitis C, published alongside today’s report (see POD), the agency warns that,  ‘a large burden of advanced liver disease can be expected over the next decade’ among infected IDUs. This is due to the fact that hepatitis C infection may progress to liver cirrhosis and cancer, requiring costly treatment. The EMCDDA explores some of the positive advances in treating the disease today, including a new generation of medicines which act in a shorter period of time and carry reduced side-effects (e.g. direct-acting antivirals; interferon-free treatment). But, it says: ‘In spite of the burden of disease and recent improved treatment outcomes for hepatitis C patients, available data show treatment uptake to be very low among IDUs’. Also, in some European countries, initiatives directed at testing and counselling injecting drug users about hepatitis C are ‘still limited and poorly funded’. Studies suggest that encouraging infected drug users into hepatitis C antiviral treatment, not only reduces transmission of the virus, but can also prevent new infections.   ‘We now know that drug users can benefit from HCV treatment and that new therapies are becoming available that offer even greater opportunities to intervene effectively’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘We also know that far too few drug users are benefiting from these developments. We must act to promote early intervention, encourage service uptake and remove barriers to care. The long-term costs of inaction in this area, for both those infected and the public purse, will be considerable’. Drug-related deaths — some decline, but still a major public health challenge Drug use is one of the major causes of mortality among young people in Europe, both directly through overdose (drug-induced deaths) and indirectly through drug-related diseases and accidents, violence and suicide. Most studies of cohorts of problem drug users show mortality rates in the range of 1–2% per year, representing an ‘excess mortality’ (risk of death compared with the general population) in this group of 10 to 20 times higher than in their non-drug-using peers (Chapter 2). Overall, around 6 500 overdose deaths, mainly related to opioids, were reported in 2011. While this is down on the 7 000 cases in 2010 and 7 700 in 2009, reducing drug-related deaths remains a ‘major challenge for public health policy in Europe’, says the report. Addressing this challenge is brought into focus today in a special EMCDDA review on new responses to drug-related deaths (see POD). The agency highlights, among others, how to improve bystander responses by training peers and families of drug users in recognising and responding to overdoses, so that fatal outcomes can be avoided. This includes the reversal of opioid effects with an effective and inexpensive antidote (naloxone). Five countries — Denmark, Germany, Italy, Romania, UK — report pilot projects or programmes providing take-home naloxone to opioid users, their families and carers (Figure 3.4). Neglecting the social needs of drug users can undermine chances of long-term recovery Treatment for drug problems plays a significant role in helping drug users end, or at least manage, their substance use. But there are concerns that measures to encourage their ultimate inclusion in society are often overlooked, potentially undermining their chances of long-term recovery. According to the EMCDDA, all countries today report the existence of social reintegration services of some kind which can help improve social skills, promote education and employability and help meet housing needs (Figure 3.12). But, it adds, that levels of provision are generally ‘insufficient in relation to needs’. Among clients who entered specialised drug treatment in 2011, about half were unemployed (47%) and almost one in 10 lacked stable accommodation (9%). Low educational attainment is also common among this group, with 36% having completed only primary education (Chapter 3). The success of social reintegration measures often relies on collaboration between different support services. On a positive note, a recent EMCDDA survey showed that 17 out of 28 countries reported the existence of some form of partnership between drug treatment agencies and services offering support in areas such as housing and employment. Drug services for prisoners — still a ‘treatment gap’ between community and prison Recent studies report that between 5% and 31% of prisoners have ever injected drugs (Chapter 3). While some prisoners stop or reduce their drug use when incarcerated, others may initiate drug use or engage in more harmful practices (e.g. sharing injecting equipment). Prisoners with drug problems often have complex health needs requiring multidisciplinary responses, making needs assessment upon prison entry an important intervention. Most countries now report partnerships between prison health services and community health providers, but, overall, the provision of drug services in prisons still lags behind provision in the wider community. The EMCDDA emphasises the need to ensure continuity of care for prisoners on their release, when the risk of overdose death is elevated due to reduced opioid tolerance. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/7_en

Mr Browne heads a six-person delegation which is visiting Portugal to examine the country’s drug policy model. The fact-finding trip takes place in the context of a reassessment of the UK's policy on drugs and drug addiction.

EMCDDA_UNK_0388	2013-05-02	UNK	Leading experts to review global developments in detecting illicit drugs in wastewater	 Leading European and international experts will meet in Lisbon from 6–8 May to review the state of the art of a rapidly-developing scientific discipline known as ‘drug wastewater analysis’. The event, ‘Testing the waters: the first international multidisciplinary conference on illicit drugs and wastewater’, is being organised by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), in collaboration with: the EU-funded SEWPROF project; the Italian Mario Negri Institute; and the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (1). Drug wastewater analysis — also known as ‘drug sewage epidemiology’ or ‘wastewater sampling for drugs’    — is an emerging field with the potential to monitor population-level trends in illicit drug use (2). By sampling a known source of wastewater — for example, a sewage influent to a wastewater treatment plant — scientists can now obtain estimates of the total quantity of drugs consumed by a community by measuring the levels of illicit drug metabolites excreted in urine. Over 100 participants from 20 countries will attend the event and explore the potential of this new technology for: estimating consumption of illicit drugs in the community; assessing the value of drug control interventions; and complementing more conventional methods of monitoring drug use. While drug wastewater analysis does not provide the type of individual consumption data currently yielded by drug surveys (e.g. lifetime, recent, current use), its ability to pinpoint total consumption rates in a given population make it a useful complement to existing methods for studying drug use trends in Europe. Ahead of the event, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘Work in the area of drug wastewater analysis is developing at a vigorous pace. This novel approach to studying illicit drug use in the community appears increasingly promising and could have important implications for how we monitor drug use trends in the future. The possibility that a new technique for estimating illicit drug use might be added to the existing repertoire of research and monitoring methods is an exciting prospect’. The conference, the first international event to focus solely on this topic, will hear presentations on the latest research findings and technical advances in the field and identify information gaps and future research needs. The results of an EMCDDA project covering 26 European cities (launched in January 2012) will also be presented and discussed by an international consortium of researchers. Research into wastewater analysis is of increasing interest and relevance worldwide and a multidisplinary approach is essential for its development. For this reason, the conference will combine the varied perspectives of: analytical chemistry, biochemistry, environmental and sewage engineering, forensic science, pharmacokinetics, physiology, spatial epidemiology, statistics and conventional drug epidemiology.   The conference is not open to the media but experts will be available for comment by telephone via the EMCDDA press office (Tel. 351 211 21 02 40). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/4_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0389	2013-04-30	UNK	EU drugs agency to launch European Drug Report 2013	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) has reshaped the way in which it reports on Europe’s drugs problem. On 28 May, the agency will present its annual overview of the European drug situation in a new information package designed to be ‘more timely, interactive and interlinked’. Central to the package is the European Drug Report 2013: Trends and developments which replaces the former Annual report on the state of the drugs problem in Europe, traditionally published in the autumn. Released six months earlier, the shorter, graphic-rich report summarises the latest trends across the 27 EU Member States, Norway, Croatia and Turkey. Accompanying the report are the online interactive Perspectives on drugs (PODs) providing deeper insights into a selection of important issues. This year, issues identified include: new treatment approaches for hepatitis C; high-risk cannabis use; cocaine-related emergencies; and the control of increasingly available new psychoactive substances. The package will be completed by the annual Statistical bulletin and Country overviews which offer national-level data and analysis. The above changes take place in the context of the EMCDDA’s latest three-year strategy (2013–15) which is based on the guiding principles of: relevance and timeliness; efficiency and value; and communication and customer focus. The developments are designed to keep pace with both the rapidly shifting drug phenomenon and the growing needs and changing expectations of the agency’s audiences. The European Drug Report 2013 will be available in 23 languages (in print and online).

EMCDDA_UNK_0390	2013-04-18	UNK	Prevention services for minority ethnic groups explored	 Today we are launching our latest publication in the field of prevention. ‘Drug prevention interventions targeting minority ethnic populations’ is a Thematic paper that comes as part of the agency’s monitoring of action 20 of the European Union drugs action plan 2009–12 on developing services for minority groups, including migrants. It contains the results of a study carried out via questionnaire that examined drug prevention interventions for minority ethnic populations in 29 European countries. A total of 33 interventions were reported to the study and the issues they raise are presented and discussed in the paper. These results will add to the agency’s existing information on this topic and inform the EMCDDA’s plans for 2013–15 in terms of monitoring drug prevention interventions. This report comes at a time when the EMCDDA’s manual on European drug prevention quality standards, released in 2011, has once again been in the spotlight. The manual was recently selected by the American Library Association as a ‘Notable Government Document’ of 2011, in the ‘International’ category. The publication sets quality benchmarks on how to develop prevention in organisational and logistical terms, giving guidance on how to choose programmes, how to adapt them and how to select the workforce implementing them. Work from the project group that prepared this manual will soon move to a second phase including additional tools for the implementation of the standards in the group’s partner countries (Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Hungary, Austria, Poland, Sweden and UK). Translations of the manual, along with extra sources of information, are available on our website with Polish and Hungarian versions already available and more languages in the pipeline. Work in the field of prevention has also recently been enhanced by a new UNODC handbook on International Standards on Drug Use Prevention, which complements the EMCDDA’s manual and reports. While the EMCDDA’s manual on European drug prevention quality standards focuses on how to do prevention, the UNODC manual adds to it what to do in prevention. Update 20 June: We have now released another Thematic paper on this topic. Called ‘North American drug prevention programmes: are they feasible in European cultures and contexts’, the paper documents the process of transferring successful prevention programmes from North America to EU Member States, analysing how such programmes adapt to different cultural contexts. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/prevention-minorities_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0391	2013-03-07	UNK	New drug 4-MA to be placed under control across the EU	 Europe has responded today to concerns over the use of the stimulant drug 4-methylamphetamine (4-MA) by subjecting it to ‘control measures and criminal penalties’ throughout the Union. The Decision of the Council of the EU (1) was adopted in the final stage of the three-step legal procedure designed to respond to potentially threatening new psychoactive drugs entering the market (2). The Council Decision is based on the findings of a formal risk-assessment report on 4-MA produced in 2012 by the extended Scientific Committee of the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), with participation of additional experts from the EU Member States, European Commission, Europol and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) (3). The report, submitted to the Commission and Council in November 2012, assessed the health and social risks of the drug as well as international trafficking and the involvement of organised crime. 4-MA belongs to the group of synthetic phenethylamines and is closely related to amphetamine. It has no established medical value and has no known legitimate purpose, aside from limited use in scientific research.The drug appears to be sold on the illicit market as amphetamine, being frequently mixed with it. Available information suggests that it is produced and distributed by the same organised crime groups involved in the manufacture and trafficking of amphetamine. The Council Decision states that the evidence available provides ‘sufficient grounds for subjecting 4-methyl-amphetamine to control measures across the Union’. Reasons for the conclusion include: the drug’s strong similarity to amphetamine and the health risks it poses. The risk-assessment report detailed 21 fatalities (4) in four EU Member States (Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, UK), where 4-MA was detected in post-mortem samples, either alone or in combination with other substances (particularly amphetamine). The adverse effects of 4-MA include: hyperthermia, hypertension, anorexia, nausea, paranoia and anxiety. Eight EU Member States (Denmark, Germany, Ireland, France, Cyprus, Lithuania, Netherlands, UK) already control 4-MA under drug control legislation (four doing so via generic legislation on phenethylamines). In addition, two countries (Hungary and Austria) have introduced new legal frameworks to prohibit the unauthorised supply of individual or groups of substances (4-MA is controlled under the generic definition of phenethylamines). One Member State (Finland) controls the drug under medicines legislation. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz welcomed the news: ‘Today’s decision to introduce controls on 4-methylamphetamine is another positive example of Europe’s ability to respond to new psychoactive substances and demonstrates the strength of the EU early warning system. As a number of countries already control 4-MA, this decision will help avoid problems in cross-border law enforcement and judicial cooperation. Furthermore, Union-wide measures will also help to prevent some of the harmful health effects caused by the drug.’ EU Member States have one year to take the necessary measures to submit 4-MA to controls in line with their national laws (5). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/2_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0392	2013-02-28	UNK	National drug policy of Ireland explored in new EMCDDA policy profile	 The national drug policy of Ireland comes under the spotlight in the latest volume in the EMCDDA series of Drug policy profiles released today. The report, the second publication in this series, explores: the country’s national strategies; the legal context within which they operate; the public funds spent, or committed, to implement them; and the political bodies and mechanisms set up to coordinate the response to the multi-faceted problem of drug use. The profile sets this information in context by outlining the size, wealth and economic situation of the country as a whole (see ‘Ireland in figures’), as well as the evolution of the current policy through four periods of historic development (see ‘Policy timeline’). It also describes how, as in many European countries, drug policy in Ireland is coordinated at three broad levels: the inter-departmental (or inter-ministry), the operational, and the regional or local. ‘Today’s Irish drugs policy may be viewed as balanced, with strong supply and demand reduction features, expressed in a managerial style that seeks to generate a high level of consensus through stakeholder involvement, building on internationally established best practices’, concludes the report. But it adds that this policy model, and the problems it responds to, may ‘undergo further changes’ as the drugs phenomenon evolves. This EMCDDA series aims to describe some of the main characteristics of national drug policies in Europe and elsewhere in the world. The profiles do not attempt to assess national policies, but instead outline their development and main features. The objective is to help readers — from researchers to policymakers — gain a better understanding of the way in which countries control drugs and respond to drug-related security, social and health problems.

EMCDDA_UNK_0393	2013-01-31	UNK	Speech by Wolfgang Götz, EMCDDA Director	 It is a great pleasure to be here today with Commissioner Malmström and my close colleague Rob Wainwright, Director of Europol, to launch the first EU drug markets report. I would like to thank the Commissioner for setting the EMCDDA and Europol the exciting challenge of providing the first joined-up and holistic analysis of drug supply and availability in Europe. The cooperation between our two agencies ensures that Europe’s responses are configured to meet the challenges posed in this area today. Over the last decade, the world has experienced a period of extensive change, driven by the twin engines of globalisation and technological advancement. The way people work, play and socialise has been transformed. These changes have also had an impact on patterns of drug use and on the drug market. We are now facing a very different kind of marketplace… and we need to adapt our policies and responses to this reality. On a positive note, the combination of rigorous demand and supply side actions has resulted in the decline in heroin problems across Europe. This is a good rebuttal to those who say that current drug policies have no impact. But, we must accept that stimulants, including cocaine and synthetic substances, are now more important players on the European drug scene. Patterns of drug use have become more fluid — with consumers often using multiple substances or substituting one drug for another — depending on availability, price or perceived quality. The take-home message here is that we can no longer afford to think about individual drugs in isolation. We must take a more joined-up and market-level view — and you find this perspective throughout the report we are presenting today. This joined-up view is particularly important when we look at new drugs or so-called ‘legal highs’ — perhaps one of the most challenging areas for drug policy today. ‘Legal highs’ have been brought onto the market in sophisticated new ways, and with alarming speed: 73 substances were notified in 2012, up from 49 in 2011, and more than 200 substances have been notified across the EU since 2005. Within a short period of time, ‘legal highs’ have become a global phenomenon. Products, sometimes containing complex cocktails of chemicals, have been developed in illicit laboratories and marketed using attractive packaging. The end result is that an increasing number of young people are experimenting with substances about which very little is known. I would like to come back to cannabis — a point already highlighted by the Commissioner — because it is a good case study for the developments we are seeing in many areas of the drug market. As with synthetic drugs, there has been a trend towards producing the drug near to its intended consumers — and this will be a growing trend in the future. Today, cannabis is produced in virtually all EU Member States, and it is often cultivated intensively using high-tech approaches. The cannabis produced by these methods can be of high potency… and potentially more damaging to health. Let me finish by saying that we can only respond effectively to the developments we see in the European drug market if we base our actions on good data, intelligence and sound analysis — and this is what we have provided in this report. Organised crime is investing in new products, new techniques and new operational approaches… But we will continue to work closely together across Europe to identify these threats and ensure that our responses remain appropriate and pre-emptive. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen of the press, I believe that the EU drug markets report represents a good example of how critical and cold-headed analysis can point the way to more effective actions.   I am delighted that the EMCDDA has had the opportunity to collaborate with Europol on this important project. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013-0_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0394	2013-01-25	UNK	First strategic analysis of the European drug market	 Drug trafficking is a highly profitable commercial activity and remains a core business for organised crime groups across Europe today. Understanding the reality of the European drug market requires a holistic approach, following the economic chain from production, via trafficking, to consumption. Taking such an approach, two EU agencies — the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and Europol — have joined forces to provide the first state-of-the-art overview of this market in its entirety. The EU drug markets report — a strategic analysis will be launched in Brussels on 31 January by European Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmström. The Commissioner will be joined at the press conference by EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz and Europol Director Rob Wainwright. Launch date: Thursday 31 January 2013Time: 12:30 (Central European Time)Press conference: European Commission, press room, Berlaymont, BrusselsReport (English) and press materials (EU languages): Commissioner Malmström's website (embargo 31.1.2013 at 12.00): See also EMCDDA event's page ● EuropolContact: (Spokespersons’ service): Michele Cercone (+ 32 2 298 09 63) Tove Ernst (+ 32 2 298 67 64). Experts at the EMCDDA and Europol will also be available for interviews (see contacts below). Individual chapters explore today’s markets for heroin, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamine, methamphetamine, ecstasy and new psychoactive substances. Each of these opens with key statistics ‘at a glance’, going on to address issues as broad as production, consumer markets, trafficking and organised crime. Adopting an approach which is pragmatic and applied, the agencies identify key conclusions to inform future policies. The analysis provided combines insights from the EMCDDA’s monitoring and data analysis of Europe’s drug phenomenon with Europol’s operational understanding of trends in organised crime.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/1_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0395	2013-01-22	UNK	EMCDDA signs accord with the First Faculty of Medicine of Charles University in Prague	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the First Faculty of Medicine of Charles University in Prague will be cooperating in training and research activities in the field of drugs in the future, thanks to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the two parties today in the Czech capital (1). The signatories were Professor Aleksi Šedo, Dean of the Faculty, and Wolfgang Götz, EMCDDA Director. Also present was Alexis Goosdeel, Head of the EMCDDA’s Reitox and international cooperation unit. Signed for an initial period of five years, this agreement establishes structured cooperation between the EMCDDA and the Faculty, promising to enhance the exchange of experts and promote the organisation of joint training activities on broad aspects of drug monitoring. A Reitox Academy training course, ‘Contemporary approaches in drug monitoring’, expected to take place from 15–20 April 2013, will be the first common activity implemented under the agreement. Designed for professionals working in the field of drug monitoring, this course aims to boost knowledge and skills on drug-related data collection, analysis and interpretation. It will present the latest developments in drug monitoring, combining long-term and routine data collection with new complementary tools and methods. The programme will also offer the participants a unique opportunity to reflect further on the role of national drug observatories in producing drug-related information that makes a difference to stakeholders. A significant part of the course will be dedicated to the link between data collection and the organisation of services, as part of a more comprehensive approach to responding to drug-related issues. The course will be open to participants from acceding, candidate and potential candidate countries to the EU and will be financed under the EMCDDA-IPA project preparing IPA beneficiaries to participate in the work of the agency (2)(3). The Department of Addictology of Charles University in Prague (4), operating under the above Faculty, will be the EMCDDA’s main partner in implementing the course. The Department, which already has strong experience in education on drug monitoring and epidemiology, will ensure that the programme meets recognised quality criteria (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System/ECTS). Commenting today, Wolfgang Götz said: ‘With this Memorandum of Understanding, the EMCDDA and the First Faculty of Medicine of Charles University combine their resources and experience to provide partners from EU and non-EU countries with up-to-date, high-quality training on drug monitoring with a focus on added value for national, European and international stakeholders’. The Czech national focal point of the Reitox network (5) is one of the EMCDDA’s long-term partners assisting acceding, candidate and potential candidate countries to the EU in improving drug-related data collection in their respective countries. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2013/fs2_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0397	2012-12-14	UNK	New EMCDDA report reveals risks of substance use behind the wheel	 The use of illicit drugs and psychoactive medicines amongst drivers, particularly when combined with alcohol, is described today in a new report from the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) (1). The ‘state of the art’ review presents the results of the largest research project ever carried out in the EU on Driving under the influence of drugs, alcohol and medicines (the ‘DRUID’ project), which ran between 2006 and 2011 (2). Around 30 000 people die in traffic accidents in the EU every year, with alcohol still the number one substance endangering lives on Europe’s roads (around one quarter of road deaths). The European Commission funded the DRUID project in order to assess the scale of Europe’s drink- and drug-driving problem and contribute key evidence to road safety policy. It culminated in 50 project reports, running to several thousand pages. The new 50-page EMCDDA review summarises the findings of these reports. For the first time using comparable data, the project drew a map of the drink- and drug-driving problem across  13 European countries (Figure 2). Over 50 000 car and van drivers were tested in random roadside surveys for traces of 25 substances, including illicit drugs, alcohol and medicines. Alcohol was detected in 3.5 % of drivers, illicit drugs in 1.9 % and medicines in 1.4 %. Mixtures of drugs or medicines were found in 0.39 % of those stopped and combinations of alcohol with drugs or medicines in 0.37 %. A series of project recommendations are made to counter driving impaired by substance use. The roadside surveys revealed cannabis (THC) to be the most frequently detected illicit drug in drivers, followed by cocaine and amphetamines. Meanwhile, benzodiazepines were the most frequently found medicine, with medicinal opioids less common. Across Europe, the prevalence of alcohol, cocaine, cannabis and combined substance use was found to be higher in southern and western regions. Medicinal opioids were detected more in northern Europe, while substance use was relatively low in most of the eastern region. Alcohol and drugs were found more often in male drivers, while medicines were identified mainly in middle-aged and older female drivers. Commenting today Wolfgang Götz, EMCDDA Director, said: ‘The DRUID project has given policymakers the best available scientific evidence on levels of drug and alcohol use in drivers and the responses available today to improve road safety in Europe. The EMCDDA is proud to be associated with this project, which has set the standard for assessing drug driving in European countries in order to design more effective solutions in future’. Also examined in the study were data from nine countries on drivers seriously injured or killed in traffic accidents. In sharp contrast to the results of the roadside tests, between a quarter and a half of drivers involved in crashes in these countries (28 % to 53 %) tested positive for one or more psychoactive substance (Figure 3). Overall, 24.4 % of the injured driver population and 31.7 % of the killed driver population tested positive for alcohol, around 70 % of these being severely intoxicated (blood alcohol content ≥ 1.2 g/l). Among those testing positive for alcohol, the highest percentage of seriously injured drivers was found in Belgium and the highest percentage of drivers killed in accidents found in Portugal. Among those testing positive for cannabis, the highest percentage of seriously injured drivers was again found in Belgium and the highest percentage of drivers killed in accidents in Norway. Cocaine use appeared to be more common in southern Europe. The project looked at how different substances can impair driving and calculated the risks of being seriously injured or killed while driving with psychoactive substances in the body (Table 2). The findings disprove the common belief that illicit stimulants enhance driving or counter alcohol and lack of sleep. Studies found that stimulants are often taken in very high doses which can have detrimental effects on self perception, critical judgment and risk-taking. These effects are greatly increased when stimulants are combined with alcohol. Responding to drink- and drug-driving in Europe Today’s report describes some of the positive responses to drink- and drug-driving developed in Europe. Effective prevention initiatives include training programmes and support tools to help doctors and pharmacists review their prescribing and dispensing practices and advise on the effects of medicines on driving performance. For the patients who take those medicines, pictograms on medicine packages, using DRUID’s four-level classification and labelling system, have been shown to be effective in communicating risk. Information campaigns targeting young people, however, are rarely evaluated and thus their effectiveness remains unclear. Three options commonly used by policymakers to address drink- and drug-driving are: ‘impairment’ (proof that the substance has impaired driving ability); ‘legal limit’ (‘over the limit’ being an offence) and ‘zero tolerance’ (any amount found being an offence). At present, 11 countries in Europe use the ‘impairment’ approach, while eight use the ‘zero tolerance’ or ‘legal limit’ approach. Nine countries combine these two approaches into a two-tier system, the option recommended by the project. Enforcing these laws, however, remains a challenge due to accuracy concerns regarding drug-testing procedures. None of the roadside oral fluid testing devices achieved the target value of 80 % sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for all the individual substances tested. The DRUID project illustrated the measurable increased risk to road safety posed by illicit drugs. Yet, a cost–benefit analysis carried out under the project warned public authorities to think carefully before switching resources from alcohol to drug detection. The scale of the threat posed by alcohol, combined with a continued lack of adequate drug detection devices at the roadside, means that road user safety might suffer from such a switch. As the report explains: ‘As the risk and share of injuries is higher for alcohol, targeting driving under the influence of alcohol should always be the first priority of law enforcers.’   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/13_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0398	2012-12-14	UNK	New EU drugs strategy endorsed	 The new EU drugs strategy (2013–20) was endorsed by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 7 December. Through an integrated, balanced and evidence-based approach to drugs, the strategy aims to contribute to reducing drug demand, drug supply and drug-related health and social risks. The strategy is structured around two policy areas (reducing supply and demand) and three cross-cutting themes: coordination; international cooperation; and information, research, monitoring and evaluation. For more on the strategy’s objectives, see Council's document (CORDROGUE 101). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/eu-drugs-strategy_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0399	2012-12-10	UNK	Drugs and wastewater	 This week, the EMCDDA is hosting three meetings in Lisbon on the topic of drugs and wastewater. Wastewater analysis is a rapidly developing scientific discipline with the potential for monitoring real-time population-level trends in illicit drug use. On 10 December, the results of an EMCDDA multicity project will be presented by an international consortium of researchers. The project, launched in January 2012, generated comparable data covering 26 European cities, thanks to an agreed common sampling approach. On 11 and 12 December, the EMCDDA, in collaboration with the Norwegian Institute for Water Research and the Research Council of Norway, will hold a workshop on determining illicit drug use in populations through wastewater biomarker analysis . Finally, kicking off on 13 December, is the SEWPROF research project  funded by the European Commission. The project aims to develop inter-disciplinary research capability for the next generation of scientists working in the newly-emerging field of sewage epidemiology. The EMCDDA is an associated partner. For more see: www.emcdda.europa.eu/wastewater-analysis 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/wastewater_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0400	2012-12-06	UNK	Board re-elects unanimously Portuguese member João Goulão as EMCDDA Chairman and Belgian member Claude Gillard as Vice-Chairman	 João Goulão, Portuguese national drug coordinator and Head of the General-Directorate for Intervention on Addictive Behaviours and Dependencies (SICAD), was re-elected Chairman of the EMCDDA Management Board today for a second three-year term. Dr Goulão was first elected Chairman of the Board in December 2009. He has been the Portuguese representative on the Board since 2005 and previously served on the agency’s Scientific Committee (1997–2002). A medical doctor by profession, Dr Goulão has over 20 years’ experience in preventing and treating drug addiction in Portugal, having steered a variety of national bodies in these fields. He was also a member of the Portuguese commission which proposed the current national drug strategy.    Claude Gillard (Belgium), a founding member of the agency, was also re-elected today to the position of Vice-Chairman. Mr Gillard, Legal counsellor at the Belgian Ministry of Justice, has chaired the EMCDDA Budget Committee since 2003 and has greatly facilitated the Board’s decisions on budgetary and financial matters. Commenting on the results, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘I congratulate the Chair and Vice-Chair on their re-election and thank them for their hard work and cooperation throughout their first mandate. I look forward to working with them in accomplishing the new EMCDDA strategy and work programme for 2013–15 and in navigating the agency successfully through these difficult economic times and in an increasingly challenging field‘. Wolfgang Götz has been Director of the agency since May 2005, having been appointed by the Management Board on 19 April that year. In July 2009, the Board renewed his mandate unanimously for a further five-year term from 1 May 2010 to 1 May 2015. The Management Board is the EMCDDA’s main decision-making body which meets twice a year in Lisbon. The Board consists of one representative from each EU Member State and Norway, two European Commission representatives and two independent experts in the drugs field designated by the European Parliament. At its two-day meeting in Lisbon this week (6–7 December), the Board gave its final seal of approval on the agency’s 2013 budget and work programme. Discussions also covered cooperation between the agency and Israel and procedures for the selection and appointment of the 15 members of the EMCDDA Scientific Committee for the period 2014–16. A call for expression of interest in membership of the Committee will be launched on the EMCDDA website early in 2013.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/12_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0402	2012-11-22	UNK	Conference to develop key indicators for monitoring drug markets, crime and supply reduction	 European drug policy is based on a balanced approach that deals with both the supply and demand for illicit drugs. The need to scale up the monitoring of illicit drug supply in Europe is a key component of the EU drugs action plan 2009–12 (1). In this light, the European Commission and the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) are joining forces in Lisbon this week (22–23 November) to organise the Second European conference on drug supply indicators (2). The event is organised with the active participation of Europol. Building on the results of the first conference on this theme, held in Brussels in October 2010 (3), this week’s event represents the final stage of a process to develop European indicators for monitoring drug markets, crime and supply reduction. Over 100 European and international experts will gather at the by-invitation conference. Among them will be: law-enforcement officers, forensic scientists, criminologists, national data-collection specialists, economists, policy analysts and technical staff of EU and international institutions. The event aims to achieve technical consensus on a clear conceptual framework for information collection; the identification of priority needs; and a realistic implementation plan. It will also identify the elements required for defining a roadmap for moving forward in this area of recognised importance to European drug policy. The conference will offer the opportunity to: review background material and progress achieved to date; build consensus on the core components needed for each proposed indicator; identify elements for the roadmap to develop the new indicators; identify the structural and human support needed to implement the indicators; and reach technical consensus on the way forward. The conference will provide the necessary technical support to enable the EU institutions to endorse the set of European key indicators in the three areas in question. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/fs-10_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0403	2012-11-15	UNK	EU drugs agency raises concerns over complex stimulant market and plethora of powders and pills	 Europe is faced with an increasingly complex stimulant market, in which consumers are confronted with a wide variety of powders and pills. While cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines continue to be the main players on the stimulant scene, they are now competing with a growing number of emerging synthetic drugs, such as cathinones, one of the largest groups of new  drugs being reported in Europe today. Other stimulants are also under scrutiny, and there are signs of methamphetamine making further inroads into the market. Developments in the European stimulant market are described today in the Annual report 2012: the state of the drugs problem in Europe, launched by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in Lisbon (1). In the eyes of the consumer, these drugs are, to some extent, ‘interchangeable products’, says the agency, with factors such as availability, price and purity influencing consumer choices and making for a volatile market. The report also describes how users may often be unaware of what they are actually purchasing. Cecilia Malmström, European Commissioner with responsibility for the EMCDDA, says: ‘Stimulant and synthetic drugs play a central role in the European drug situation, creating a market which is fast moving, volatile and difficult to control. More than ever before, young people are exposed to a plethora of powders and pills. Data from emergency rooms, toxicology reports and drug treatment centres indicate that the associated risks are not always well known by the users.’ ‘In addressing these new challenges’, adds EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz, ‘it is critical that we improve our understanding of the health and social impact of emerging trends and develop measures to reduce demand. To do this, better forensic and toxicological analysis is essential; as is the need to proactively engage with those most at risk’. Cocaine — further signs of falling use and status Over the last decade, cocaine has established itself as the most commonly used illicit stimulant drug in Europe, although most users are found in a small number of western EU countries. Around 15.5 million Europeans (15–64 years) have tried cocaine in their lifetime, around 4 million having used it in the last year (Chapter 5, Table 8). While cocaine use remains a major part of the stimulant drug problem, today’s data confirm the analysis in last year’s report that its popularity and image as a ‘high-status drug’ may be declining. While some countries still report rising cocaine consumption, recent surveys of cocaine use reveal some positive signs in high-prevalence countries. Denmark, Ireland, Spain, Italy and the UK for example — the five countries with highest levels of use — report some decline in last-year cocaine use among young adults (15–34 years), echoing the trend in Canada and the United States (Chapter 5, Figure 10; Figure GPS-14, part ii). Potential users may now be more aware of the negative consequences that can accompany cocaine consumption. Low cocaine purity may also be causing some users to switch to other stimulants. Of the 23 countries providing trend data on cocaine purity, 20 reported a decline between 2005 and 2010. The EMCDDA index of average cocaine purity in the EU fell by 22 % in this period (Figure PPP-2). The report shows that the number of cocaine seizures in Europe continues to fall, reaching around 88 000 in 2010 compared with 100 000 in 2008 (Table SZR-9). The quantities of cocaine seized are also on the decline at  European level. Having peaked at around 120 tonnes in 2006, they fell by around half to 61 tonnes in 2010 (Table SZR-10) (Chapter 5, Table 7). This rather dramatic fall in the volume seized probably reflects a diversification in cocaine trafficking operations that has made cocaine interception more challenging. It may also reflect changes in drug law-enforcement resources and priorities in key seizing countries. Evidence that fewer drug users are seeking treatment for cocaine problems also suggests that its popularity may be waning. Around 15 % of drug users entering specialised treatment report cocaine as their main problem drug (Figure TDI-2, part ii). Recent data on trends in those entering treatment for cocaine problems now show a modest drop in numbers (Figure TDI-3, part ii). Further signs of MDMA making a comeback on the ‘ecstasy’ market Around 11.5 million Europeans (15–64 years) have tried ‘ecstasy’ in their lifetime, around 2 million in the last year (Chapter 4, Table 6). Today’s data confirm the analysis in last year’s report that MDMA — the best-known member of the ‘ecstasy’ group of drugs — is making a comeback (2). This follows a shortage of MDMA in recent years when tablets sold as ‘ecstasy’ often contained other substances (e.g. mCPP, BZP, mephedrone). The drop-off in the manufacture of MDMA has been linked to successful measures to limit the diversion of PMK, the precursor chemical needed to make it. But manufacturers are now finding alternative chemicals as their starting material for MDMA. While the contents of tablets sold as ‘ecstasy’ remain diverse, powders and tablets containing high doses of MDMA appear to be becoming more common. Methamphetamine makes further inroads into Europe’s stimulant market Use of amphetamines (a term encompassing amphetamine and methamphetamine) remains overall lower than that of cocaine in Europe. Around 13 million Europeans (15–64 years) have tried amphetamines in their lifetime, around 2 million in the last year (Chapter 4, Table 5). Latest trend data show last-year use of amphetamines among young adults (15–34 years) to be overall stable or declining (Chapter 4, Figure 7). Of the two drugs, amphetamine is more commonly used. But methamphetamine use, historically low in Europe and mainly limited to the Czech Republic and Slovakia, now appears to be spreading. Recent EMCDDA Annual reports have pointed to rising availability of methamphetamine and its edging into new territory in the north of Europe, where it has partially been replacing amphetamine as the stimulant drug of choice (Latvia, Sweden, Norway, Finland). In addition, the EMCDDA notes that, in 2010, Germany, Greece, Cyprus, Hungary and Turkey also reported signs of problem methamphetamine use, although estimated at low levels. Data on seizures published today suggest that production is scaling up and that methamphetamine is making further inroads into Europe’s stimulant market. Between 2005 and 2010, the quantity of methamphetamine seized in Europe (25 EU countries) rose from around 100 kg to around 600 kg (Table SZR-18). Meanwhile, the number of methamphetamine seizures more than tripled in this period from around 2 200 to around 7 300. Countries witnessing marked rises in the number of seizures of this drug between 2009 and 2010 include Germany, Estonia, Latvia and Austria (Table SZR-17). Further concerns highlighted today relate to the first, albeit sporadic, reports of methamphetamine smoking in Europe and to the availability of ‘crystal meth’. Methamphetamine smoking, to date extremely rare in Europe, is known to be particularly damaging to health. Early in 2013, in response to recent developments, the EMCDDA will launch a ‘trendspotter’ review of this drug which has caused considerable problems outside Europe (e.g. Australia, Japan, New Zealand, USA). 4-MA — new amphetamine-type stimulant now under scrutiny in the wake of deaths Europe has responded to rising concern over the use of the stimulant drug 4-methylamphetamine (4-MA) by formally requesting an investigation into the health and social risks of the substance (including the involvement of organised crime). The risk-assessment exercise will be carried out in Lisbon this week by the EMCDDA Scientific Committee with experts from the European Commission, Europol and the European Medicines Agency. Currently, the substance is not controlled under drug control legislation in most of the EU Member States (see Joint report)(3). The exercise is the second stage of a three-step legal procedure through which Europe monitors and acts on new drugs. It was prompted by deaths linked to this substance in Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK (the two latter  control the substance) and reports of seizures in 14 European countries. A risk-assessment report will be submitted to the European Commission and Council of the EU after the meeting, on the basis of which the Council may decide to subject the drug to control measures across the EU. 4-MA belongs to the group of synthetic phenethylamines and is closely related to amphetamine. On the illicit market, it appears to be sold as amphetamine or mixed with it. This suggests that, while there is little evidence of a specific demand for 4-MA, amphetamine users may be at greater risk of exposure to the drug if it becomes more available. Over 50 new drugs already detected in 2012 — substances more diverse and more obscure New drugs continue to be reported in the EU at the rate of around one per week. A total of 49 new psychoactive substances were officially notified for the first time in 2011 via the EU early-warning system (EWS)(4). This represents the largest number of substances ever reported in a single year, up from 41 substances reported in 2010 and 24 in 2009. And preliminary data for 2012 show no signs of a decline, with over 50 already detected. Synthetic cathinones (e.g. mephedrone, MDPV), which can mimic the effects of cocaine, are one of the two largest drug groups monitored by the EWS (the other being synthetic cannabinoids — e.g. found in ‘Spice’ products)(5). Particularly noteworthy in 2011 was the rising number and diversity of substances reported. All new drugs notified last year, and so far those notified in 2012, have been synthetic. Alongside rising diversity within the more common new drug groups, the EMCDDA reveals that more obscure chemical groups being reported (see Chapter 8, Figure 20 — ‘Other substances’). It also informs that: ‘The number of products containing multiple psychoactive substances appears to be rising’, with seizures and test purchases revealing samples to contain both controlled and uncontrolled substances. One example is the detection of PMMA in products sold as ‘legal highs’. Placed under control in Europe following an EU risk assessment in 2002, this drug carries high risks of overdose and poses a serious threat to users (6).  To date, says the EMCDDA, data have been scarce on levels of use of these substances, but with countries now carrying out representative surveys including new drugs (e.g. Ireland, Spain, UK), preliminary prevalence data are emerging. Whilst the reported levels of the overall use of these drugs remain relatively low, there is potential for  increased uptake in use amongst certain groups. A 2011 Eurobarometer survey on young people’s attitudes to drugs estimated that, on average, 5 % of the young respondents (15–24 years) reported to have used ‘legal highs’ at some point in their life, although levels varied between countries (7). Record number of online shops selling ‘legal highs’ Today’s report presents the results of the 2012 EMCDDA snapshot of online retailers of ‘legal highs’ which identified a record 693 online shops purportedly selling psychoactive products to EU countries — up from 170 in January 2010. Although three natural products — kratom, salvia and hallucinogenic mushrooms — lead the Top 10 ‘legal highs’ most frequently offered online, the other seven substances were synthetic (see Chapter 8, Table 10). The snapshot identified a marked rise in the number of Internet shops offering synthetic cathinones (e.g. MDPV,  4-MEC), suggesting that online operators are seeking a replacement for mephedrone, now controlled in the EU. To date, most new drugs have been targeted at recreational drug users. Yet, in some countries, problem drug users are also using new drugs. Reports from Hungary show opioid users injecting synthetic cathinones (mephedrone, MDPV) in times of heroin shortage. ‘Older-new’ drugs must not be overlooked As attention focuses on old established drugs or the emergence of new substances, a number of the ‘older-new’ drugs have established themselves on the market and should not be overlooked, warns the EMCDDA. These now include GHB, GBL, ketamine, mephedrone and PMMA (8) for which pockets of high use, or increased availability, are reported. Negative health effects, including dependence among chronic users, have been linked to these drugs, while unexpected problems have surfaced, such as bladder disease in ketamine users. These developments underline the need for countries’ drug information systems to be more sensitive to emerging trends and health problems relating to these substances. Proactive response: countries devise range of tools to tackle threat of emerging drugs Across Europe, a variety of measures are being developed to reduce the demand for, and supply of, new drugs (see Chapter 8). The speed at which new psychoactive substances can appear and be distributed challenges countries’ established legislative procedures for drug control (9). The Annual report describes how several countries have responded with ‘innovative changes to their legislation or enforcement policies’ (see Chapter 1). The main trend in many countries appears to be to focus on penalising supply rather than use.      Ireland (2010), Romania (2011) and Austria (2012) have introduced new criminal laws penalising the unauthorised distribution, sale or advertising of new psychoactive substances. Other countries have modified existing laws to strengthen or speed up drug control procedures. Poland (2010), for example, has modified its drug law to prohibit the distribution of new substances, while Hungary (2010) and Finland (2011) have set up risk-assessment panels to inform decision-making. In 2011 and 2012 respectively, the UK and Hungary enacted new procedures, becoming the latest countries to bring in ‘temporary controls’ on a substance. These controls are introduced pending further consideration of the harms associated with the drug concerned and a decision on permanent sanctions. Controls on chemical families of substances (generic controls) rather than individual substances have been introduced in a number of countries’ drug laws in recent years. New developments in this area are reported from: Luxembourg (2009, synthetic cannabinoids); Italy (2011, synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones); Cyprus (2011, synthetic cannabinoids, cathinones, phenethylamines), Denmark (2012, synthetic cannabinoids, cathinones, phenethylamines, tryptamines) and France (2012, cathinones). But drug laws are not the only means used to meet the challenges posed by these new substances. Countries are also turning to their medicines and consumer safety laws, for example, to tackle the issue. Consumer safety regulations requiring that goods on sale are accurately labelled in relation to their expected use have been invoked to confiscate ‘Spice’ products in Italy, and mephedrone labelled as ‘bath salts’ and ‘plant food’ in the UK (before mephedrone was controlled under the country’s drug law). Looking to the future, the European Commission, supported by the EU Member States, the EMCDDA, Europol and the European Medicines Agency is working on new legislation to better address the emergence of new psychoactive substances in the EU (10). Commenting further on the report, European Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmström, noted: ‘This new analysis from the EMCDDA is particularly welcome as it highlights the drug problems we share across the European Union and informs the work we are currently undertaking to strengthen Europe’s strategic and operational approach to drug trafficking and use. I am particularly struck by the speed of developments we are now seeing in the area of synthetic drugs. I think it is clear to all that strong and coordinated actions are required if we are to respond effectively in this area’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/10_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0404	2012-11-15	UNK	New EMCDDA report shows heroin use in decline and patterns of drug use shifting	 Since the 1970s, heroin has held centre stage in Europe’s drugs scene and is still responsible for the largest share of drug-related diseases and deaths in the EU. But while heroin-related problems continue, they do so at lower levels, says the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). According to its Annual report 2012: the state of the drugs problem in Europe, launched in Lisbon today: ‘We may now be moving into a new era in which heroin will play a less central role in Europe’s drugs problem’ (1). ‘Increasingly, it has been noted that, in parts of Europe today, new recruitment into heroin use has fallen, the availability of the drug has declined and, recently, some countries have experienced acute shortages’, states the report. Developments in the illicit drug markets will need to be followed closely to establish whether recent shortages will result in a long-term reduction in heroin availability and in other substances taking its place. Recent declines in heroin use have occurred against a backdrop of rising treatment provision (Figure HSR-2). Over half of the estimated 1.4 million regular opioid users in the EU and Norway (mostly heroin users) have access to opioid substitution treatment today. Heroin — fewer new recruits and less heroin in supply  Around half (48 %) of those entering specialist drug treatment report opioids, mainly heroin, as their main problem drug (Table TDI-5, part ii). The long-term and chronic nature of heroin problems means that many of these users will remain in need of help for years to come. But, on a positive note, the report describes how the drug is now claiming fewer new recruits (Figure TDI-1, part ii). Across Europe, the number of those entering specialist drug treatment for the first time for heroin problems fell from 51 000 in 2005 to 46 000 in 2010, having peaked at 61 000 in 2007 (Figure TDI-1, part ii). Among other countries, the decline was noticeable in those with long experience of heroin epidemics such as Italy, Portugal and the UK (Table TDI-3, part i). Opioids, mainly heroin, are present in the majority of reported drug-induced deaths in Europe. New data show a small decrease in these deaths in the EU Member States and Norway from around 7 600 in 2009 to 7 000 in 2010. Market indicators suggest that heroin is becoming less available on the streets of Europe. The decline in the number of heroin-related offences observed in 2009 continued in 2010 (Chapter 2, Figure 3). Latest figures for seizures also point to an overall decrease in heroin supply. Around 51 000 seizures resulted in the interception of 6 tonnes of heroin in 2010 in the EU and Norway, compared with 56 000 and 8 tonnes in 2009 (Chapter 6, Table 9; Table SZR-7; Table SZR-8). Shortages were felt in some countries in late 2010 and early 2011, particularly in Ireland and the UK where law-enforcement successes may have played a role (2). Cecilia Malmström, European Commissioner with responsibility for the EMCDDA, says: ‘The decline in heroin use in the EU is the result of long-term efforts to reduce both supply and demand. Vigorous policing along heroin trafficking routes has played an important role in stemming supply. Equally important has been the expansion of substitution treatment, which has removed a significant part of the demand from the market. Together these factors may help create the conditions for a continuing decline in Europe’s heroin market in future. Europe may now represent, in some respects, a more difficult marketplace for this substance’. Shifting patterns of problem drug use Changes in heroin availability in Europe may be linked to a ‘shift in drug use patterns’, says the EMCDDA. Some countries in Europe report that opioids other than heroin are now cited as the main problem drug by a high proportion of those entering treatment (Table TDI-113). In Estonia and Finland, for example, the heroin market collapsed almost a decade ago and never fully recovered. Over three-quarters of those entering treatment in Estonia report the synthetic opioid fentanyl as their main problem drug. A 2012 EMCDDA ‘trendspotter’ meeting examined the latest developments for fentanyl, which is considerably more potent than heroin and particularly associated with overdose and drug-induced deaths (3). Buprenorphine, a synthetic opioid commonly used in substitution treatment, is the most frequently reported misused primary opioid among those entering treatment in Finland. Other opioids are reported by a high proportion of clients entering treatment in Denmark, Latvia and Austria. Meanwhile, some countries are witnessing problem drug users taking substances other than opioids in times of heroin shortage. Reports include increased injecting of cathinones (Hungary) and of amphetamines (Hungary, Latvia) as well as increased use of benzodiazepines and other medicines (Ireland, Slovenia). Injecting drug use continues to fall Data from treatment clients continue to show an overall decrease in opioid injection (particularly heroin injection) in Europe. A 10-year analysis of trends (2000–09) in heroin users entering treatment, for example, shows that the proportion of those reporting injecting has declined in most European countries. This trend is particularly clear in western EU Member States and among those entering treatment for the first time (Chapter 6). The EMCDDA estimates that among first-time treatment entrants, the proportion of heroin injectors fell to around a third (38 %) in 2009 from over half (58 %) a decade earlier (4). Newly reported HIV cases among injectors at new low, but worrying outbreaks in some countries While the move away from heroin injecting is encouraging, injectors remain among those at the highest risk of experiencing health problems related to drug use, such as blood-borne infections (e.g. HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, C),  overdoses and drug-induced deaths. Over the last decade, large gains have been made within the EU in addressing HIV infection among people who inject drugs — these include a greater coverage of prevention, treatment and harm-reduction measures. Latest European data show that the average rate of newly reported HIV cases in this group continues to fall and has reached a new low of 2.54 new cases per million population per year (an estimated 1 192 new cases in 2010). The overall EU situation compares positively with some countries bordering the EU, where the average rates are much higher (104.3 in Russia; 151.5 in Ukraine — Chapter 7, Figure 16). Despite Europe’s success in fighting HIV transmission among drug users, the virus retains the potential to spread rapidly in certain groups. Today’s report provides an update on worrying outbreaks of HIV infection among injectors reported by Greece and Romania in 2011 (see box, Chapter 7) (see also this news update on the topic published today). In Greece, the number of newly diagnosed drug injectors infected with HIV was estimated at around 9–19 per year up to 2010 but then jumped to 241 new cases in 2011, due to a local, but large, epidemic among injectors in Athens. The number increased from 1–6 cases to 114 new cases in Romania in the same period. Responding to the outbreak, Greece substantially increased syringe provision in Athens and its drug treatment capacity (opening 22 new opioid substitution units in 2011). In Romania, access to substitution treatment remains limited, but there are signs that syringe provision is slightly improving following a substantial drop in 2010–11 due to lack of funding. A recent risk-assessment meeting (October 2012) of the EMCDDA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) examined further reports of increases in HIV risk among injectors in several countries, stressing the need for caution (5). Chairman of the EMCDDA Management Board João Goulão said: ‘We must remain vigilant to the potential risks of future HIV outbreaks. Countries seeing increases would benefit from critically reviewing their national prevention and control programmes and assessing the quality and coverage of key HIV prevention measures, such as opioid substitution treatment, needle and syringe exchange programmes and antiviral treatment. There is a continuous need to keep public health and sufficient preventive services on the agenda in these challenging economic times’. Anthrax outbreaks among heroin users — agencies on alert Bacterial infections are another potentially serious consequence of injecting drug use and can be life-threatening. Covered in today’s report is a recent anthrax outbreak among heroin users (mainly injectors). Since June 2012, around a dozen new anthrax cases have been reported in four EU countries — Denmark, Germany, France and the UK — possibly related to a common source of contaminated heroin and perhaps linked to the same source incriminated in an earlier anthrax outbreak in Scotland in 2009–10. The 2012 outbreak prompted a joint EMCDDA–ECDC rapid risk assessment on the issue (6). This assessment, which includes recommended measures to respond to the infections, concludes that the risk of exposure to the bacterium is ‘still present’ for heroin users. The agencies’ early-warning networks are currently on alert for new cases and surveillance has been stepped up. Special focus: responding to drug use in Europe’s prisons — closing the treatment gap It is estimated that around 635 000 people are held in penal institutions in the European Union. Studies show that drug problems are far more common in prisoners than in the general population. For example, whereas less than        1 % of the general population has ever tried heroin, lifetime prevalence levels among prisoners in 8 of the 13 countries were between 15 % and 39 %. While some prisoners stop or reduce their drug use when incarcerated, others may initiate drug use or begin to engage in more harmful practices (e.g. sharing injecting equipment). Overcrowding, poor hygiene and a lack of healthcare provision affect many prisons and contribute to the overall poor health status found in inmates. In a new review published today alongside the Annual report, the EMCDDA provides insight into drug use in the prison population and the efforts made at European and national level to improve prisoners’ rights and health (7).  The report examines the provision of drug-related services in Europe, from prison entry to prison release, addressing counselling, treatment of dependence and the prevention of infectious diseases. According to the report, many countries have scaled up the provision of interventions within prisons, particularly opioid substitution treatment. However, rarely do prisons offer a standard of care equivalent or comparable to that provided to the wider community. The report presents progress being made in several European countries towards promoting ‘equivalence of care’ and closing this ‘treatment gap’ between community and prison. This includes integrating prison health services with those in the community and, in some cases, transferring the responsibility of prisoners’ healthcare from justice to health ministries. ‘Prison healthcare has, in the past decade, increasingly been recognised as part of public healthcare’, says the report. Also noted is the need to improve continuity of care for prisoners on their release, when the risk of overdose death is extremely high, due to reduced opioid tolerance. Pre-release counselling and overdose response training are highlighted in this regard. ALSO EXPLORED TODAY… Europe, now a major cannabis producer — concerns about intensive use Europe, a major cannabis consumer, is now an important producer of this, its most popular illicit drug. The Annual report describes a marked shift in the European cannabis market, with an overall trend towards ‘import substitution’ (imported cannabis products being replaced by those grown inside Europe’s borders) (8). Twenty-nine of the 30 EMCDDA reporting countries document some cultivation of herbal cannabis (‘marijuana’). In two-thirds of these countries, cannabis consumption is now dominated by herbal products and, in the other third, by imported resin (‘hashish’) (Chapter 3, Figure 4). The report shows that the number of herbal cannabis seizures made in Europe has increased steadily since 2005, and, with an estimated 382 000 seizures in 2010, has surpassed that of cannabis resin for the first time (358 000 seizures) (Chapter 3, Table 2). But the quantities of cannabis resin continue to greatly exceed those of herbal cannabis: 106 tonnes of herbal cannabis were seized in 2010 and 563 tonnes of resin. Some 80.5 million Europeans (15–64 years) have tried cannabis in their lifetime, around 23 million of them having used it in the last year (Chapter 3, Table 3). The latest European data confirm the general stabilising or downward trend in last-year cannabis use among young adults (15–34 years) cited in previous EMCDDA Annual reports (Figure GPS-4, part ii). Among school students (15–16 years), the latest (2011) European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs (ESPAD) found that, in half of the 26 EMCDDA countries participating, a stable trend in lifetime cannabis use was noted since the 2007 survey (9). In the remaining half, there are diverging trends. Nine countries showed a significant increase, the most pronounced reported by France, Latvia, Hungary and Poland. Decreases were observed in four countries (Denmark, Malta, Slovakia, UK) (see Chapter 3, Figure 6). Concerns remain around the 3 million Europeans (15–64 years) who still use the drug on a daily basis (around 1 % of the European adult population) (10). Taken as a whole, any optimism around steady levels of use needs to be tempered by the fact that this drug remains an important public health issue. Around 25 % of clients entering drug treatment report cannabis as their main problem drug.  FINALLY… EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz concludes: ‘The difficult financial situation in Europe, which forms the backdrop of our reporting, means that resources for addressing health and social problems are in short supply. Ensuring the highest treatment quality and best treatment outcome for the lowest possible cost are therefore priorities in the current climate. It is essential to ensure that the available funds are invested in well-targeted activities of proven effectiveness. By working together and sharing experiences and best practice, EU Member States can help achieve this’. In this regard Götz referred to the recent positive evaluation of the current EU Drug Strategy (2005–2012) and the importance of the upcoming new EU Drug Strategy 2013–2020.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/11_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0405	2012-11-15	UNK	Preliminary data suggest no signs of a slowing down in 2012	 In 2011, the EMCDDA and ECDC reported that new outbreaks of HIV were occurring in Greece and Romania despite an overall long-term declining trend in newly diagnosed HIV cases among injecting drug users (IDUs) in Europe. Reports received in 2012 continue to suggest increases in HIV prevalence and in rates of newly diagnosed cases among IDUs in these two countries. While in Greece prevention measures are being scaled up, in Romania coverage has declined. A joint ECDC/EMCDDA risk assessment conducted in 2011 concluded that the data available for Greece and Romania were likely to reflect true increases in the incidence of HIV among IDUs. To follow up on the results of the risk assessment exercise, updated country reports were commissioned from both countries. Data from these reports suggest there is no evidence of the outbreaks slowing down. Both in Greece (country report) and Romania (country report), increases in HIV prevalence (until 2012 and 2011 respectively) as well as in the rate of newly diagnosed cases (in 2012) are reported. In Romania, HIV prevalence increased from 4% in 2010 to around 12% in 2011 among IDUs in contact with services. In Greece (Athens), the increase in users in contact with services was from 1% to 4-5%, with preliminary data for 2012 suggesting prevalence of around 9%. In a study in a specific setting of users the prevalence was 23%. Numbers of newly diagnosed cases have also increased markedly in both countries, with the number reported during the January to August period almost doubling in Greece (from 161 in 2011 to 314 cases in 2012) while in Romania the number of cases reported in the first six months of 2012 (102 cases) is not far from the number of cases reported for the whole of 2011 (129 cases). In Greece, a rapid scaling up of interventions is taking place despite the difficult economic situation, including a large increase in the coverage of opioid substitution treatment (OST) and an increase in the number of syringes distributed by needle and syringe programmes (NSPs). In Romania, the syringe coverage level achieved with external funding since 2007 dropped significantly from mid 2010 onwards due to lack of national funding. Although the legal conditions for implementing OST by GPs have been created, its actual implementation has faced obstacles and provision has remained limited. Summary of key findings Greece 314 new cases of HIV in IDUs were reported in the first 8 months of 2012, as compared to 161 in the first 8 months of 2011. HIV prevalence among IDUs contacting services in Greece was under 1% among 2028 IDUs tested in 2010 but had reached levels of between 3.7% and 5.6% among 2269 IDUs tested in 2011. In Athens in 2012, it was 8.5% among 2573 IDUs tested in drug treatment centres while it reached 23% in a specific study that included out-of-treatment populations (1000 IDUs recruited in Athens through respondent driven sampling). Current injecting decreased among IDUs in treatment, but increased in the population accessing low-threshold services. Needle/syringe sharing increased in both new IDUs (injecting less than 2 years: from 14% in 2008 to 32% in 2011) and in young IDUs (under age 25: from 31% to 47%). The use of stimulants increased while the use of opioids (heroin) declined. Despite a substantial scaling up of responses since the beginning of 2011, OST and NSP coverage of prevention services for IDUs still remain low in comparison to international standards. Romania 102 new IDU-related HIV cases had been reported in 2012 by the end of June as compared to 30 in the same period in 2011 (129 in the whole of 2011) and 12 in 2010. Self-reported HIV prevalence among IDUs in contact with services and tested in the last 6 months increased from 4.2% in 2010 (12 out of 288 IDUs) to 11.6% (25 out of 216 IDUs) in 2011. The injecting and non-injecting use of stimulants has increased among IDUs. Evidence exists of high levels of risk behaviour: 8 out of 10 IDUs in a 2011 study reported recent sharing of used needles/syringes. Responses to the HIV outbreak among IDUs have been limited due to lack of finances and lack of an approved national HIV prevention strategy. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/HIV-outbreaks_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0406	2012-11-15	UNK	Speech by Wolfgang Götz, EMCDDA Director	 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is my pleasure to present to you today the latest findings from the EMCDDA’s 2012 Annual report on the state of the drugs problem in Europe. And I am particularly pleased to be doing this with the European Commissioner who has in her portfolio responsibility for all six EU-Home Affairs agencies including the EMCDDA. Ms Malmström, thank you very much for having accepted our invitation to come to Lisbon. I would also like to thank the Chairman of our Management Board, Dr João Goulão, for continuing our tradition of launching the Annual report together. Our analysis this year highlights the challenges we face in addressing a dynamic and volatile drug market, especially with regard to stimulants and synthetic drugs. Nevertheless, although drug use levels remain high, there are grounds for encouragement… We observe that for Europe’s major illicit drugs — heroin, cocaine and cannabis — many countries report declining consumption levels. (Heroin and opioids) First, let us look at heroin and opioid drugs. Since the 1970s, heroin use has remained at the heart of Europe’s drug problem. Indeed, the need to respond effectively to heroin use was one of the driving factors behind the creation of my agency, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) in the early 1990s. Our most recent estimate suggests that Europe has 1.4 million regular opioid users, which corresponds to about one in 250 of our adult citizens. Over the last two decades, European drug policy has largely concentrated on responding effectively to heroin-related problems — and measures have been put in place to respond to the thousands of overdose deaths each year, to the spread of HIV and hepatitis C, and to the resulting societal damage. Ms Malmström has already talked about the decline in heroin use and heroin availability. I would like to give you a few more details on the supply situation in Europe: the latest figures for heroin seizures and drug-law offences show an overall decrease. The reasons for this vary. In Estonia and Finland, heroin has been largely replaced by synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and buprenorphine. In Ireland and the United Kingdom, the recent heroin shortages reported are probably the result of law enforcement successes. And I am pleased to note that Turkey, a key partner in reducing the EU’s heroin supply, is collaborating closely with the EMCDDA. Moving on to the demand side, I would like to underline that last year at least 1.1 million Europeans received treatment for drug use. And most of them received opioid substitution treatment. We now estimate that more than half of Europe’s regular opioid users have access to substitution treatment, but in many countries there are still insufficient treatment opportunities. Mr Goulão has already stressed that infectious diseases, although declining, continue to be a challenge. The recent outbreaks of HIV in Greece and Romania remind us that despite our success in fighting the transmission of this virus among drug users, the potential for rapid spread remains. Ensuring adequate provision of HIV prevention and harm reduction services for at-risk populations remains vital. (Prison) Many regular opioid users spend time in prison — and we know that some of them stop using drugs when incarcerated, but we also know that others initiate drug use, or engage in more damaging behaviours. The risk of dying from drug overdose greatly increases in the period after release from prison, due to high rates of relapse and to lower opioid tolerance. This is a critical time for action, when ensuring continuity of care and targeted interventions will support recovery and save lives. (Stimulant drugs) Now to our findings on Europe’s increasingly complex stimulant drugs market. There is a growing variety of powders and pills now available to consumers. Cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy continue to play the most important role but in some countries we see synthetic cathinones, such as mephedrone and MDPV, joining the stimulant drug market. Cocaine remains the second most used illicit drug in Europe (after cannabis) — and about four million Europeans have consumed cocaine during the last year. In countries where the level of consumption is high indicators show that use appears to have peaked and is now trending downwards. Reasons for this are varied. Low cocaine purity may be causing some users to switch to other stimulants. And potential users may now be more aware of the negative consequences that can result from cocaine consumption. Cocaine is just one of the stimulant drugs popular in Europe. We estimate that last year, 2 million Europeans used ecstasy. The ecstasy market has undergone some transformation in recent years. First we saw a substantial reduction in the levels of MDMA in ecstasy tablets, with substances such as BZP and mephedrone being sold as ecstasy. Now, the ecstasy market appears to have bounced back from the shortage of MDMA, and high purity powders and tablets are again being reported in some countries. [By the way, the patent for synthesising MDMA/ecstasy will be 100 years old on Christmas Eve…] Amphetamines continue to be used extensively in parts of north, central and eastern Europe. An estimated 2 million Europeans used amphetamines last year. While use of amphetamine has been stable for some years, there are more worrying signs linked to methamphetamine. With the exception of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, methamphetamine use has traditionally been rare in Europe, but we have received reports, from the north of Europe, from Germany (Bavaria), Greece, Cyprus and Hungary, that methamphetamine use may be on the rise. In general, we can say that innovation in the stimulant market continues… And tomorrow, a European Union risk assessment on 4-methylamphetamine (4-MA) will take place here in Lisbon, involving members of the EMCDDA Scientific Committee and experts from Europol, the European Medicines Agency and other relevant partners. This exercise was prompted by clusters of deaths associated with 4-MA. This form of amphetamine — currently not controlled in most of Europe — was probably manufactured in clandestine laboratories by producers seeking new chemical routes for amphetamine production. (New drugs) Ms Malmström has clearly set out the considerable challenges posed by new psychoactive substances. I would like to add a few technical details here: I have just received an update on the number of new substances reported for the first time to the EMCDDA or to Europol in 2012 — we are now at 56 new molecules. Synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones are still prominent, but substances from more obscure chemical groups are increasingly reported. To date, the recreational drug market has been the main target for new substances. However, we have received reports from a few countries that in times of heroin shortage regular opioid users are switching to injecting cathinones, such as mephedrone and MDPV. In some groups of young people, we have seen a rapid increase in the use of new drugs and evidence is growing of this problem internationally. We cannot ignore the threat that these substances pose to our current drug policies. We need to step up our support to policymakers as they struggle to develop effective national responses. In this context, we need to improve our forensic science capacity and more systematically monitor medical emergencies and deaths associated with the use of new psychoactive substances. A better understanding of the health and social impact of these new drugs will enable us to develop effective demand reduction strategies. (Older-new substances) In recent years, a number of what I would call ‘older-new’ substances have gradually established themselves on the European drug market. I am talking about drugs such as GHB, ketamine and now mephedrone. The overall numbers using these drugs remain low, making it easy for them to slip under the monitoring radar… However, high levels of consumption have been identified in some groups of young people. We have also received reports of serious acute and chronic health problems linked with the use of these substances. These developments are a stark reminder that our current vision is often too limited, inhibiting our ability to identify and respond to new and emerging threats. (Cannabis market) Let us now move to the cannabis situation. Our recent analysis of the cannabis market shows that herbal cannabis production within Europe’s borders is increasingly displacing imported cannabis resin. This so-called ‘domestic’ cannabis production varies considerably from small numbers of cannabis plants grown for personal consumption to large plantations using sophisticated techniques. Cannabis continues to be by far the most used illicit drug in Europe. Here the 3 million European adults who are using cannabis on a daily or almost daily basis are of particular concern. Cannabis-related problems (anxiety, impaired coordination and performance, school failure, professional failure) are now better understood and are often associated with the intensive and long-term use of the drug. We do have some worries here… For example, the shift towards herbal cannabis may be exposing users to more potent forms of the drug, and we note that Europe is still seeing growing numbers of people entering drug treatment for cannabis problems. (School children and drugs) Journalists often ask me what is happening with substance use among Europe’s younger generation. The latest results from the ‘European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs’ (ESPAD) — with over 100 000 participating school students — show a decline in students’ recent use of alcohol and no drop in levels of cigarette smoking. When we look at students’ experience of cannabis use the picture is mixed with diverging trends in individual countries. But overall we see that cannabis use was on the rise until 2003, dropped slightly in 2007 and since then has largely stabilised. We also note a relationship between the use of different substances. For example, in those countries where many students report recent alcohol use and heavy drinking more students also report experience with cannabis and other illicit drugs. In this context, the increasingly common practice of integrating licit and illicit strategies in national policy documents is a timely one. Here we are reminded of the important role that prevention interventions play — both in establishing healthy environments and norms, and in supporting our most vulnerable young people. Finally, Ms Malmström, Ladies and Gentlemen Our new report provides you with insight into the diverse and complex nature of the drugs problem we now face. Some of what I have presented is clearly ‘good news’. However, I am too often surrounded by pessimistic voices questioning the success of efforts made… I think, when one looks carefully at the evidence, one can easily see that a European approach — which recognises that demand and supply are of equal importance,… which recognises the value of a scientific and evidence-based approach,… which is pragmatic,… which evaluates its actions… and most important of all which recognises the need to pursue long-term goals — [that this European approach] is making a positive difference. That’s what I would invite you to remember from what I have said today. Having said that, I cannot avoid finishing with some words of warning… National decision-makers are currently faced with difficult choices and competing priorities. In such times, it is more important than ever that wise investments are made in the illicit drugs area — investments based on a sound understanding of the problem and of the measures that will deliver the greatest benefits. The progress we have observed could be very easily undermined if investment in the areas we know to be effective is discontinued. Thank you very much for your attention, I welcome your questions. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/speeches/annual-report_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0407	2012-10-31	UNK	Drugs and the family: ‘room for improvement’ in responding to problems, says EMCDDA	 Around one in 10 of all drug users entering treatment for their substance use lives with at least one child. And in the last five years, the number of those entering drug treatment who report living with children has been growing. Over and above the problems they face related to their consumption, drug-using parents deal with additional concerns, such as providing adequate care for their children during treatment and fear of losing their job or their family. In a new report out today, the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) provides the first European overview of the programmes, laws and policies in place to assist pregnant drug users, drug-using parents and their children. Based on data from 23 countries, it concludes that, while an array of responses exists, there is still room for improvement. According to the report, the variety, evidence base and coverage of interventions for pregnant drug users, drug-using parents and their children could be stepped up. National data show that coverage of programmes can be low or vary substantially between countries. This may be due to difficulties in reaching the target group or to lack of funding in times of financial crisis. The report states: ‘As recovering from substance use and problems related to it may be lifelong processes, securing long-term government or other funding is an essential attribute of prevention efforts’. ‘Not all pregnant women who use drugs have problems during or after their pregnancies and not all parents with drug problems have difficulty caring for their children’, states the report. While there is no specific law in Europe applying to the children of drug users, legislation in Europe tends to strive to keep the family together rather than take the children into care. The report informs that: ‘No country reported that drug use was a reason per se to remove the child from the parent’. The report shows how drugs, including alcohol, tobacco and some prescribed medications, can have adverse effects on the pregnancy, unborn child and the newborn. Yet the true prevalence of drug use in pregnancy is difficult to gauge as drug-using women are harder to reach, being less likely to receive antenatal care than those who are drug-free. Legislation applying to pregnant drug users or to children before birth is seen to facilitate eligibility for treatment in many countries. In addition to legislation, a variety of programmes has been developed in Europe with drug-using mothers-to-be in mind. Guidelines for services for pregnant drug users now exist in around a third of the reporting countries. These mainly focus on substitution treatment for opioid use in pregnancy, following the evidence that this type of treatment can stabilise the woman’s lifestyle and encourage her into antenatal care. ‘Parents’ ability to rear, protect and care for their children, attend to their health, feed them and financially support them may be greatly diminished by their drug use’, states the report, which presents findings from studies on the potential harms of drug use on families. ‘Removing barriers to seeking treatment, including lack of childcare… might further help this target population’, it adds. Described in the report are some of the interventions available in Europe to respond to the needs of drug-using parents including addiction treatment, psychosocial support and building parenting skills. Internet-based prevention programmes are also available for young people with drug-using parents, as are resilience-strengthening initiatives to help prevent children of drug users from becoming drug users themselves. Finally, the report highlights the importance of the family itself in drug prevention work. Evidence shows that involving the family can promote treatment entry and enhance treatment effects. One example of family-based prevention is the Strengthening families programme pioneered in the USA some 20 years ago. Eleven European countries report having implemented adapted versions of this programme which is considered to be effective over the long term in preventing substance use and other problem behaviour in children. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/9_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0408	2012-10-15	UNK	Neglecting the social needs of drug users can undermine chances of long-term recovery	 Over 1 million drug users in the European Union are estimated to be receiving some form of treatment for their drug problems every year. This reflects considerable investments since the 1990s when better access to treatment became a drug policy priority. But while treatment plays a significant role in helping drug users end or, at least manage, their substance use, there are concerns that their ultimate inclusion in society is often neglected. This ‘gap’ is addressed today in a new ‘Insights’ study from the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA): Social reintegration and employment: evidence and interventions for drug users in treatment. ‘The significant number of problem drug users who have accessed European drug treatment services in recent years reflects an important step towards integration’, says the report. But, it adds, ‘neglecting the social needs of clients can undermine the gains achieved during treatment’, as well as the chances of ‘long-term success’. Latest EMCDDA data on clients entering drug treatment reveal that over half are unemployed (56 %). Low educational attainment is also common in this vulnerable group, with four out of 10 having completed only primary education or below this level. Meanwhile, around 10 % of drug treatment clients report that they have ‘no stable accommodation’. Measures addressing the housing, education, vocational and employment needs of drug users are therefore crucial to overcoming social exclusion. Today’s report reviews recent approaches in this area for problem and recovering drug users, with a particular focus on employment and employability. It shows how social reintegration can benefit the drug user and society as a whole, presents evidence for effectiveness and describes how promising interventions could inspire future research investments. Complementing the study, a new module dedicated to the topic is launched today on the EMCDDA Best practice portal, highlighting the benefits of interventions based on motivation and incentive. The ‘Insights’ study shows that, while most countries describe the existence of interventions to promote social reintegration — the term is now mentioned in the drug strategies of 22 EU Member States — data indicate that levels of provision fall short of the needs of the drug treatment population. Included in the report are a set of ‘conclusions for practice and policy’ designed to assist policymakers and drug practitioners in developing coherent and inclusive strategies to promote social reintegration. These include: further acknowledging this key issue in national drug policies and decision-making on funding and considering data on the topic when monitoring the effectiveness of drug treatment. They also call for the development of evidence-based guidelines once sufficient proof is available on ‘what works’. To date, the majority of research on this topic has been undertaken outside Europe, mainly in the USA. ‘Given the crucial role of social reintegration in limiting and overcoming drug-related problems in the long-term, a better understanding of these interventions in Europe is greatly needed’, states the report. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘Drug use often exacerbates the already difficult life conditions of excluded individuals, making integration efforts a real challenge for the person concerned and for those providing support. This aspect is particularly relevant during the current period of economic difficulties in Europe, with high levels of unemployment among young European citizens’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/8_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0409	2012-10-02	UNK	EU drugs agency to present the latest statistics, trends and analysis	 How are countries tackling the new drugs phenomenon? Are school children consuming drugs more or less than before? How many Europeans are using cannabis on a daily basis? To what extent have national responses to the drugs problem been effective? These are just some of the issues under the spotlight in the Annual report 2012 from the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) to be released in Lisbon on 15 November. Launching the annual assessment of Europe’s drugs problem will be European Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmström, Chairman of the EMCDDA Management Board João Goulão and EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. The report, the agency’s flagship publication, provides the latest data and commentary on the drug situation across the 27 EU Member States, Norway, Croatia and Turkey. Key challenges are discussed along with some of the promising practices used to address drug problems today. The Annual report is part of a comprehensive package of information.

EMCDDA_UNK_0410	2012-09-28	UNK	‘Users’ voices’ — experiences and perceptions of drug users on controlling their consumption	 A collection of narratives from substance users in Europe about their attempts to control or reduce their consumption is released today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). Entitled Users’ voices, the paper illustrates how qualitative research can provide glimpses into the experiences and perceptions of substance users that statistics alone cannot provide. Evidence shows that the power of psychoactive drugs is heavily influenced by users’ norms, values, practices and circumstances. Yet, says the paper, there is still a tendency ‘to overestimate the pharmacological properties of psychoactive substances and underestimate the influences of social, psychological and cultural aspects on drug use and on individuals’ efforts to control it’. The purpose of today’s paper is to provide a channel of expression for the ‘enormous heterogeneity’ in the experiences of substance users and what helps or hinders them as they attempt to manage their cravings. The review presents quotations gleaned from interviews with substance users in 16 countries over the period 1993–2012 (1). While some quotations are taken from chronic, long-term and marginalised drug users, others are from individuals who have managed to limit their consumption or do not fulfil common medical criteria for dependence or problem use. Also cited are social scientists engaged in research with drug users. The quotations give voice to three key issues: triggers that prompt an individual to decide to reduce or stop consumption and/or to seek help; positive experiences gained from some interventions and support; and obstacles that hinder individuals who are trying to change their behaviour. On these issues, the paper describes how decisions to control consumption are often triggered by the undermining of fundamental values (e.g. work achievements, family relations, disposable income). It also stresses the importance of learning from drug users’ experiences in treatment to help tailor services and promote understanding of what works and what does not. And the stigmatising attitudes of others are often cited as obstacles to recovery, leading to feelings of low self-worth and limiting a drug user’s stake in conventional, mainstream life. ‘Drug problems are too complex and dynamic for single magic bullet solutions’, states the paper. The testimonies gathered present a challenge to developing a stock of effective interventions and signal how complex ‘giving up’ can be. The statements do not claim to represent the situation of all those attempting to control or reduce their consumption. They do, however, make an important and universal point about the importance of choice and illustrate the need for diverse interventions that are sensitive and adapted to individual circumstances. As one eminent researcher, drug service provider and member of the EMCDDA Scientific Committee put it: ‘No matter how efficacious a treatment might be, it will produce little benefit to individuals and society if it is inaccessible, or if it is provided in a way that discourages help-seeking behaviour or reduces retention in care. Much better results are achieved by well-organised programmes with more comprehensive services’ (Strang et al., 2012). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/fs-9_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0411	2012-09-24	UNK	2012 EMCDDA scientific paper award showcases innovative research in drugs field	" The three winners of the 2012 EMCDDA scientific paper award will come under the spotlight in Lisbon this week at the annual award ceremony hosted by the EU agency (1). This year the results reflect the female face of science, with all three acclaimed authors being women. The winners — from Germany, Sweden and the UK — will receive a non-monetary prize for their contributions on 26 September in the margins the International Society of Addiction Journal Editors’ annual meeting opening at the EMCDDA this week (2). The prize, inaugurated in 2011 by the EMCDDA and its Scientific Committee (3), celebrates scientific writing and distinguishes high-quality research in the field of illicit drugs. In a new procedure adopted this year, four groups were invited to nominate papers: European research societies; EMCDDA Scientific Committee members; the national focal points of the Reitox network; and European drug research peer-reviewed journals. According to the entry criteria, all articles were published in 2011 in peer-reviewed scientific journals, with the primary author based in an EU Member State, Croatia, Turkey or Norway. Papers could be submitted in a number of categories, including: basic biological, neurobiological and behavioural research; population-based and epidemiology studies; and demand and supply reduction. The 2012 winners are:   ‘Diminished gray matter in the hippocampus of cannabis users: possible protective effects of cannabidiol’, Dr Traute Demirakca, Dipl. Psych. (Germany). Published in Drug and alcohol dependence, 114 (2011) 242–245. ‘Long-term effects of a community-based intervention: five-year follow-up of 'Clubs against Drugs'’, Dr Johanna Gripenberg, PhD (Sweden). Published in Addiction, 106, 1997–2004. ‘The impact of needle and syringe provision and opiate substitution therapy on the incidence of hepatitis C virus in injecting drug users: pooling of UK evidence’, Dr Katy M.E. Turner, PhD (United Kingdom). Published in Addiction, 106, 1978–1988. This year, some 30 eligible entries were received and judged on the criteria of: scientific originality; scientific quality; clarity and quality of writing; and EU relevance. The jury was composed of members of the EMCDDA Scientific Committee and the agency’s senior scientific staff. Abstracts of the winning papers will be available on the agency’s website in English, along with translations in German and French in an effort to share findings in non-English speaking countries. This year a full list of shortlisted papers is also available below. Commenting on the initiative, Chair of the EMCDDA Scientific Committee Dr Marina Davoli said: ‘The EMCDDA scientific paper award was conceived to reflect the importance of scientific publishing and to provide a channel for disseminating the findings of European research to policymakers and professionals.

EMCDDA_UNK_0413	2012-09-20	UNK	EU drugs agency publishes new guidelines for monitoring drug users entering treatment	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) launches today new guidelines for monitoring drug users entering treatment in Europe — updating a previous data-collection protocol adopted in 2000 (1). Published in the EMCDDA Manuals series, the guidelines have been revised to better reflect the realities of today’s drug situation and changes in treatment services and data monitoring systems. They follow a three-year revision process involving experts from the EU Member States, Croatia, Turkey, Norway and Switzerland. The EMCDDA uses a variety of monitoring methods and tools to help countries speak a ‘common language’ when interpreting Europe’s drug phenomenon. Its treatment demand indicator (TDI) — one of five key epidemiological indicators — collects harmonised information from 30 European countries on the number and profile of those entering specialised drug treatment every year (2). TDI data are routinely used in the EMCDDA’s analysis of the drug situation in Europe, helping to identify trends and patterns in problem drug use and to assess the use and uptake of treatment facilities. The new TDI guidelines will be presented today to over 50 European and international experts at the annual TDI meeting at the EMCDDA (20–21 September). Targeted at professionals and researchers, the 74-page protocol offers a common European methodology for collecting and reporting core data on those in contact with treatment services. The guidelines are part of a broader TDI toolbox of resources available online (3). The updated protocol introduces a number of improvements and clarifications in the definition of ‘case’ and of ‘drug treatment’ and in the description of treatment centres (4). It also applies international standards in relation to socio-demographic information (e.g. labour status, education). Reflecting the nature of today’s drugs problem, the protocol presents a number of new items on polydrug use, new psychoactive substances, infectious diseases, risk behaviours and substitution treatment. With these changes, it is designed to achieve a more valid and reliable description of the profile and patterns of drug use of those entering specialised treatment in Europe today. The TDI is one of the EMCDDA’s most established monitoring tools. Over the last 10 years, it has been used in presentations and training activities as an example for international organisations and as a benchmark for countries outside Europe.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/fs-8_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0414	2012-09-07	UNK	EU drugs and medicines agencies amend working arrangement today in light of recent legislation	 Exchanging information on new psychoactive substances and abused medicines is enhanced today, thanks to an amended working arrangement signed in Lisbon by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) (1). The signatories were EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz and EMA Executive Director, Guido Rasi. Today’s arrangement updates that signed by the agencies in 2010 and furthers cooperation between them. It was drawn up in the light of newly applied EU legislation on pharmacovigilance designed to strengthen Europe’s system for medicines safety. The legislation was adopted in 2010 and applies from 2 July 2012 (2). The two EU agencies have worked closely together since 1997 when they began exchanging information on, and assessing the risks of, new synthetic drugs in Europe (3). Since 2005, they have cooperated in implementing the three-step legal instrument through which Europe now monitors and acts on new psychoactive substances (4). According to the new legislation, the EMA and the EMCDDA ‘shall exchange information that they receive on the abuse of medicinal products including information related to illicit drugs’. New to the arrangement signed today is that the EMA will now inform the EMCDDA of any ‘validated signals’ (5) on the suspected side effects of medicinal products related to drug abuse. The arrangement strengthens the agencies’ information exchange practices and will help them respond in a more timely manner to potential public health threats. Other features of the arrangement include the exchange of expertise (e.g. via consultations, projects, meetings) and the possibility for the EMA to consult the EMCDDA when defining risk management plans for selected medicinal products. The agencies are currently collaborating in an ongoing European investigation into the health and social risks of the new psychoactive substance 4-methylamphetamine. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/fs-7_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0415	2012-07-23	UNK	New EMCDDA report reviews measures for creating safer nightlife environment for young people	 How to prevent and reduce the health and social risks associated with drug and alcohol use in recreational settings is examined today in a new paper from the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) (1). The EU is actively addressing the use of these substances on the nightlife scene, as illustrated by the 2009–12 EU drugs action plan and the adoption of specific Council conclusions in 2010 (2). Reflecting these conclusions, the paper — Responding to drug use and related problems in recreational settings — reviews some of the approaches used today to minimise the hazards for young people in this milieu. Surveys confirm that in many recreational venues drug use is more prevalent than in the general population (see Table 1). Drug and alcohol use in recreational settings are linked to a range of health and social problems. These include: acute health problems (e.g. unconsciousness and unintentional injury); aggressive behaviour and violence; unsafe and unwanted sex; and driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. According to the paper: ‘The increased mobility of young people and the globalisation of the entertainment industry make it necessary to address these problems in Europe, especially in popular tourist destinations in southern Europe’ (3). Today’s report highlights the need for a balanced mix of prevention, harm reduction and law enforcement interventions to tackle the issue. It also describes how environmental strategies, targeting the economic and physical context of the substance use, can be effective (e.g. safe venues, crowd management, chill-out rooms). Establishing partnerships between stakeholders (e.g. municipalities, police, health authorities) can also help implement successful nightlife interventions. Research shows that community-based programmes that deliver coordinated measures through multi-agency collaboration are more effective than single interventions. Underage drinking, violence in or outside nightlife venues and drunk driving are often best addressed by means of policing and law enforcement measures. The paper shows that, while these can work, they need to be carried out ‘on a regular basis and linked to real deterrents’ if their positive effects are to be maintained. Training programmes for bartenders, door supervisors and other staff in recreational venues — which combine education with skills-building — can also prove valuable, although results are sporadic. While the above approaches have shown positive results, the most common intervention targeting young people at nightlife events remains information provision via brochures or peer educators. Yet research has not found this to be an effective way of reducing drug- and alcohol-related problems in this target group. To improve the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions for creating safer nightlife settings, the European Commission has funded a website project ‘The Healthy Nightlife Toolbox’ (4). This comprehensive source of information is designed to help local, regional and national policymakers, as well as prevention workers, to identify and implement effective responses. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/fs-6_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0416	2012-07-17	UNK	EMCDDA 2012 Statistical bulletin provides latest data on Europe’s drugs problem	 Over 400 tables and 100 graphs presenting the latest data on the European drug phenomenon are released today in the 2012 Statistical bulletin from the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) (1). Monitoring and analysing the nature and scale of the Europe’s drug problems is a central part of the agency's work. Published yearly, the Statistical bulletin is one of the EMCDDA’s key outputs, providing drug-related statistics, key indicator data and trends. Available for viewing on screen, or downloadable in Excel format, the information is organised according to 11 datasets, covering issues from the prevalence of drug use and the demand for treatment to the price and purity of drugs, responses to drug use and drug-related crime, infectious diseases and deaths (2). Data in this latest bulletin relate to 2010 and are provided from the 27 EU Member States, Croatia, Turkey and Norway. This year, efforts have been made to improve the product’s visual impact and to facilitate navigation, thereby enhancing how the data are disseminated to the agency’s target groups (policymakers, researchers, practitioners, general public). A new web format offers the user tools to interact with the data online, select countries and zoom into graphs. One of the highlights in this year’s Statistical bulletin is the inclusion of data from the latest European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) (3). Conducted every fours years, this survey provides a crucial insight into drug use among 15–16-year-old school students. Over 100 000 students took part in the latest survey across 36 countries (23 being EU Member States). The Statistical bulletin is the result of close collaboration between the national focal points of the Reitox network (4) and experts at national level, and the EMCDDA at European level. Behind the scenes, consultation on data collection and submission is carried out in a year-long process. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/fs-4_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0417	2012-07-17	UNK	EU drugs agency EMCDDA signs accord with Moldovan Ministry of Health	 The European Union and the Republic of Moldova will share information on drugs more systematically in future, thanks to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed today in Chisinau between the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Moldova. The signatories were Andrei Usatîi, Moldovan Minister of Health and Wolfgang Götz, EMCDDA Director (1). Also present was Cécile Martel, EMCDDA Head of sector for international cooperation. The ceremony was followed by a visit to the Prime Minister of the Republic of Moldova, His Excellency Vladimir Filat. The EMCDDA Management Board adopted the MoU on 5 July at its latest meeting in Lisbon, following talks begun in October 2011. Moldova is one of the first countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy area, and in particular the Eastern Partnership, to pursue closer relations with the EMCDDA (2)(3). In 2010, the country adopted an Anti-drug national strategy (2011–18) and has participated in recent ESPAD school surveys (4). Thanks to EU financial support (5), it also set up a national drug monitoring centre in 2004, and has compiled a drug Country overview, available on the EMCDDA website (6). Signed for an initial period of five years, the new agreement establishes structured cooperation between the EMCDDA and the Moldovan competent bodies and promises to enhance the partners’ knowledge base on the drugs situation and responses to it in areas of both supply and demand. Also underlined is the importance of exchanging information on monitoring and on preventing and treating drug use. The Moldovan National Centre for Health Management (NCHM), operating under the Ministry of Health, is named in the MoU as the country’s official Reitox national focal point (7). Under the agreement, the NCHM will cooperate with the EMCDDA to further develop its capacity for producing an accurate picture of the Moldovan drug situation, thereby contributing to a comprehensive overview of the European drugs problem. Since the EU enlargement of May 2004, the EU and Moldova have shared a common border and, as direct neighbours, face common challenges. Among these are the fight against illegal cross-border activities, including organised crime, terrorism and drug trafficking. A joint work programme, to be agreed between the two parties, will set out priorities. Within their respective legal frameworks, the partners will invite each other to attend meetings on subjects of mutual interest, while the EMCDDA will facilitate training and capacity-building. Commenting on the MoU, Wolfgang Götz said: ‘Today’s accord lays the foundation for a new working relationship between the EMCDDA and its Moldovan counterparts and is an important step towards building an evidence base on the Moldovan drug situation in the European context. This agreement will allow Moldovan policymakers and professionals to benefit from the EMCDDA knowledge base when tailoring their responses to the drugs problem. We look forward with enthusiasm to working with our Moldovan partners on the broad range of issues which characterise our drug problems today’. After the signing ceremony, the EMCDDA visitors also met: Alexei Roibu, Minister of Internal Affairs; Natalia Gherman, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration; Ambassador Dirk Schuebel, Head of the EU Delegation to the Republic of Moldova; Dr Oleg Barba, NCHM Director; and Dr Mihai Oprea, Director of the Republican Narcological Dispensary.

EMCDDA_UNK_0418	2012-07-12	UNK	EU and Russian drugs agency chiefs meet in Moscow to discuss plans for future cooperation	 The EU and Russian drugs agency chiefs meet in Moscow today to further their strategy for cooperation. At the talks, Wolfgang Götz, Director of the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and Viktor Ivanov, Director of the Federal Drug Control Service of the Russian Federation (FDCS), will be focusing on the agencies’ exchange of information and expertise and laying groundwork for joint activities over the next three years. Also present will be Paul Griffiths, EMCDDA Scientific Director. Following the meeting at the FDCS, the EMCDDA visitors will meet Ambassador Fernando Valenzuela, Head of Delegation of the EU to the Russian Federation. This visit takes place in a ‘milestone year’ for the EU and the EMCDDA as they take stock of progress made in the drugs field and define new horizons. Key upcoming developments include a new EU drugs strategy for 2013–20 and a new EMCDDA strategy for 2013–15. The EMCDDA and FDCS cooperate under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in the margins of the EU–Russia summit in October 2007 (Mafra, Portuguese Presidency of the EU) (1). The MoU allows for an exchange of information and expertise in a number of areas, including: •    illicit drug use and trafficking in the EU Member States and the Russian Federation; •    new drug types and emerging drug use trends; •    technologies for the production of illicit drugs; •    newly emerging trafficking methods; •    legislative and administrative measures to reduce illicit drug use; and •    prevention of drug-related crime. Today’s meeting will open with presentations from the two agencies on the drug situation in the EU and the Russian Federation, including insights into the heroin problem and drug-related HIV. Also described will be challenges in tackling drug trafficking, preventing crime and reducing drug supply and demand. Particular focus will be placed at the meeting on monitoring new drugs entering the market. New psychoactive substances were detected in the EU last year at the rate of around one per week (49 new drugs) (2). Reflecting the importance of international cooperation in this area, representatives of the FDCS attended the first landmark international forum on new drugs organised by the EMCDDA in Lisbon in 2011 (3). Information sharing in this area and online monitoring of the new drugs phenomenon will be among the points explored at the talks. The agreement between the two agencies foresees the participation of experts in meetings as well as training and capacity-building activities. Since the signing of the MoU, the agencies have moved forward in this area, with FDCS members recently participating in the EMCDDA’s first-ever ‘Reitox week’, which brought together some 45 countries (4). The event was based on the premise that cooperation in the drugs field must cross borders in order to build an accurate picture of the drug situation and responses to it in the EU and its neighbouring countries. Looking to the future, the prospect of a Russian expert working at the EMCDDA will be explored, as will the possibility of the partners’ exchanging experience on building national drug observatories (5). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/fs-3_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0419	2012-06-26	UNK	Market share of herbal cannabis increasing as domestic production rises, says EU drugs agency	 ‘The market share of cannabis herb is increasing across Europe at the expense of cannabis resin’. This is according to the first comprehensive analysis of Cannabis production and markets in Europe, released today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) to mark International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking (1). The report describes a cannabis market in a ‘continual state of evolution’ and how Europe, a major cannabis consumer, is now an important producer of this, its most popular illicit drug. Also documented is the wide variety of products on sale and how the rise in herbal cannabis cultivation inside Europe’s borders is increasingly associated with collateral damage such as violence and criminality. Over 78 million Europeans (15–64 years) have tried cannabis, while around 9 million young Europeans (15–34 years) have used it in the last month. This represents a sizeable market and one that has greatly evolved. According to the report, in terms of size and sophistication, today’s European cannabis market contrasts considerably to that of the 1960s, when importation was mainly the pursuit of ‘amateurs and enthusiasts’. The report describes how profits to be made from the cannabis trade have rendered it a mainstream activity of criminal organisations and one often linked to trafficking in other illicit commodities (e.g. cocaine). But that is not to say that all cannabis production is the work of organised criminals. Presented in the report are the many categories of cannabis grower found today and the motivations driving them (e.g. social, commercial). ‘One of the most important developments impacting on the modern cannabis market is simply its increase in scale’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘Wherever you live in Europe today, it is likely that not very far away cannabis is being bought or sold. Cannabis offences make up the majority of drug offences reported in the EU. And around 700 tonnes of cannabis herb and resin are seized in Europe annually. Meanwhile, virtually all EU countries now report being affected by the domestic cultivation of cannabis, a development bringing with it consequences in terms of public health and security. In this report, we bring together state-of-the-art evidence to offer an in-depth analysis of cannabis production and markets across Europe’. The two main products manufactured from illicitly grown cannabis are herbal cannabis (‘marijuana’) and cannabis resin (‘hashish’). But these may be broken down into numerous sub-types with varying compounds and effects. Looking at the complexity of today’s cannabis market, the report says: ‘It is as if we are looking at the use of alcohol, but without the ability to distinguish between beer, wine and whisky consumption’. Rising domestic production and import substitution Inside Europe, indoor cultivation of herbal cannabis is limited only by access to electricity and water and sophisticated techniques (including hydroponics) are often used to increase the quantity and ‘quality’ (potency) of the product. Today 29 of the 30 EMCDDA reporting countries report some cultivation of herbal cannabis. Today’s report chronicles a dramatic shift in the European cannabis market over the last two decades, describing an overall trend towards ‘import substitution’ (imported cannabis products being replaced by those grown inside Europe’s borders). The analysis shows that, in two-thirds of Europe (30 countries reporting to the EMCDDA; see Figure 5.4), cannabis consumption is now dominated by herbal products (and by imported resin  in the other third). In 10 of these countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia and Croatia), 90% or more of the cannabis consumed is herbal. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland and the UK have all experienced a steep growth in the levels of domestic herbal cannabis production in the last two decades. Data on the number of cannabis plantations discovered in Europe show signs of an increase in cannabis domestic production in most countries reporting data since 2004 (see Table 3.2). Considerable challenges posed by indoor cultivation techniques have led to a number of intelligence-led approaches to market interdiction involving new technologies and information sharing. Among the innovative responses described in the report are partnerships between the police and sectors with a stake in preventing domestic production (e.g. electricity providers, housing authorities). An emerging specialised commercial sector is also providing services and equipment (radars, thermo-imaging cameras) to reduce cannabis supply. Yet, most law-enforcement attention still appears to be focused on cannabis use rather than supply (Figure 6.2). The report shows that in 19 out of 22 countries with sufficient data, the majority of cannabis offences are related to use, with proportions varying between 51% and 96%. Imported cannabis resin and the ‘Big five’ — Morocco still Europe’s main supplier, but production estimates misleading Cannabis is the most widely cultivated illicit drug plant worldwide. Today’s report describes the ‘Big five’ regions considered the main sources of cannabis products (mainly resin) imported into Europe. These are: North Africa (Morocco), South-west Asia (Afghanistan); the Balkans (Albania); the Middle East (Lebanon) and sub-Saharan Africa (South Africa) (see Figure 2.1). ‘Although Europe has been one of the world’s largest and wealthiest consumer markets for cannabis resin for more than 30 years, little cannabis resin is produced there, and practically all consumption must be supplied from abroad’, states the report. This is reflected in cannabis seizure data. The quantity of resin seized in 2009, for example, was almost six times the quantity of herb seized (approx 600 tonnes and 100 tonnes respectively).             Morocco consistently ranks first as exporter of cannabis resin to Europe, the product entering the region mainly via Spain and Portugal. Although some sources report vast decreases in Moroccan resin production between 2003 and 2009, these are called into question by European data suggesting that some production estimates for Morocco appear to be unrealistically low (Tables 2.2 and  2.3). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/5_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0420	2012-06-26	UNK	Speech by Wolfgang Götz, EMCDDA Director	 INTRODUCTION/WELCOME Dear Secretary of State for Health/Secretary of State for Cooperation/Mayor of Lisbon Dear Ambassadors and members of the Lisbon diplomatic community Dear Representatives of the Portuguese authorities Dear Chairman of the EMCDDA Management Board Dear colleagues and friends It is my great pleasure to extend a warm welcome to you today to this, our seventh annual reception celebrating International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking. At this event, we bring together every year the diplomatic community in Lisbon, our partners from the Portuguese authorities and the EU bodies in Portugal. WHY THIS DAY IS IMPORTANT This day was established by the United Nations over 20 years ago to strengthen action and cooperation in tackling the drugs problem and in creating safer and healthier societies across the world. Despite continued and increased efforts, the world drugs problem continues to constitute a serious threat to public health, safety and well-being. I would like to underline two of the threats facing us in Europe today in this field: we continue to witness a growing number of new drugs appearing on the EU market: last year a total of 49 new psychoactive substances were officially notified via the EU early-warning system for the first time — a rate of around one per week. And in 2012, 35 new substances have already been notified; HIV epidemics continue to pose a major public health problem for many countries, with outbreaks in new HIV infections among drug injectors being notified recently in some EU Member States; RECENT and FORTHCOMING ACTIVTIES These are among the many reasons why, in the EU, we cannot slow down in our efforts to tackle the drugs problem. 2012 is a milestone year for the EU and for the EMCDDA as we prepare to enter new strategic cycles in 2013, taking stock of progress made and defining new horizons. Developments will include: a new EU drugs strategy for 2013–20, with the EMCDDA playing a central role in monitoring and evaluating the drugs problem; and a new EMCDDA 2013–15 strategy and work programme. As regards our current activities, I would like to highlight two publications being released today on our website: Cannabis production and markets in Europe, which presents the first comprehensive analysis of this market across the EU, and a leaflet 2011: a year in review, offering an overview of the EMCDDA’s activities last year. These are merely two of around 50 EMCDDA publications being launched this year alone. I would like to draw your attention to one of the new titles under preparation, a totally new report ‘commissioned’ by the European Commission. This EU report on drug markets: a strategic analysis will be published jointly with Europol at the beginning of 2013. EMCDDA publications are drawn up by a group of highly qualified staff members, to whom I would like pay a most deserved tribute. The expertise of our staff members is recognised also beyond the borders of the EU, as illustrated earlier this month when our Scientific Director, Paul Griffiths, received an award for Excellence in international leadership from the US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). This award commends those who have made significant contributions to international collaborative research and capacity building (outside the United States) and who have helped improve scientific understanding of drug abuse and addiction. WORKING RELATIONSHIP and CLOSING Before I conclude, I would like to acknowledge the constant support we receive from the Portuguese authorities — in particular the Parliament, Government and the Municipality of Lisbon — and the productive working relationship we have forged with them. Last but not least, I also acknowledge the support of the administrative services of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Finance which continue to contribute a great deal to facilitating our work. It is now my honour to pass the floor to His Excellency the Secretary of State, Deputy to the Minister of Health, Dr Fernando Leal da Costa. Thank you.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/speeches/26June2012_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0421	2012-06-08	UNK	EU drugs agency Scientific director awarded for excellence in international leadership	 EMCDDA Scientific director, Paul Griffiths, M.Sc., has been selected as a winner of the  2012 United States National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) International Program Awards of Excellence (1). The annual awards, which celebrate achievements in mentoring, collaborative research and international leadership, will be presented on 9 June. The ceremony will be held during the 2012 NIDA International Forum, taking place in Palm Springs (CA), where the EMCDDA and NIDA are co-hosting the Second interdisciplinary forum on new and emerging psychoactive substances (2). In a short acceptance speech, Paul Griffiths expressed his appreciation to NIDA for the award but also noted that he accepted it very much as recognition of the efforts, dedication and professionalism of the EMCDDA staff who had worked hard over the last decade to dramatically improve the scientific quality of the agency’s outputs. In doing this, they had been greatly facilitated by the nurturing and supportive environment created by EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz who had provided the space for the scientific teams to 'do their work'. Paul also noted that he had been fortunate to have worked with many creative and generous individuals over his career. He made special reference to the guidance and support received during his time at UNODC from Cristina Oguz, Head of the Demand reduction section, and while at the UK National Addiction Centre, from his colleagues Professors John Strang, Michael Farrell, Michael Gossop and John Marsden. Mr Griffiths will receive the Award for Excellence in International Leadership which recognises drug abuse researchers who have made significant contributions to international collaborative research and/or capacity building outside the United States and who have helped improve scientific understanding of drug abuse and addiction. Mr Griffiths joined the EMCDDA nearly a decade ago and became Scientific director in 2010. Throughout his tenure, he has supervised a commendable increase in the scope and scientific sophistication of the agency’s work. Mr Griffiths and the agency’s staff now monitor all aspects of drug use in Europe, maintain a network of European drug information centres, and, with Europol, operate an EU early-warning system on new psychoactive substances. ‘The 2012 Awards of Excellence winners are dedicated and experienced leaders in the international effort to advance drug abuse research and training. This year’s winners have helped to prepare international scientists to work together across international borders and to lead the way for key scientific breakthroughs’, says Director of the NIDA International Program, Steven W. Gust, Ph.D. He adds: ‘Mr Griffiths has made a tremendous contribution toward improving systems to monitor drug abuse trends and standardising statistical records, greatly improving the data base for drug programme and policy decisions’. Before joining the EMCDDA, Mr Griffiths worked at the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC),  where he revised the primary UN instrument for collecting information on the drug situation. He also developed and implemented the UN global assessment programme, which created drug information systems in Africa, the Caribbean, Central Asia, and Latin America. Collaborating with the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe, he made similar contributions to the countries of the former Soviet Union. His work with others on a large and diverse portfolio of research projects in the UK coalesced in the formation of the National Addiction Centre. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘Paul Griffiths has made a dynamic and inspiring contribution to monitoring and analysing the drugs problem, to boosting scientific standards and to making the EMCDDA today’s reference point on drugs in Europe. Along with his colleagues at the agency, I congratulate him wholeheartedly on this award’.    The 2012 Award for Excellence in Mentoring went to Clyde B. McCoy, Ph.D., of the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/fs-2_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0422	2012-06-07	UNK	Leading experts to review global developments in new drugs and ‘legal highs’	 The United States National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) bring together leading US, European and international experts this week to take stock of the global ‘new drugs’ phenomenon. In the framework of the 2012 NIDA International Forum, taking place in Palm Springs (CA) from 8–11 June (1), the organisations will co-host the Second interdisciplinary forum on new and emerging psychoactive substances gathering over 300 participants from 72 countries. Building on the First international multidisciplinary forum on new drugs (2), organised by the EMCDDA in Lisbon in May 2011, this year’s forum will focus on new and emerging synthetic and natural drugs, such as synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (e.g. ‘Spice’) and stimulants (e.g. cathinones). EMCDDA Scientific Director Paul Griffiths, who will receive on 9 June the 2012 NIDA International Program Award for Excellence in International Leadership (3), will deliver a keynote speech on ‘New psychoactive substances — a growing challenge for drug policy and practice’. Other speakers include Volker Auwaerter of the University Medical Centre, Freiburg, who, in 2008, first identified the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018 found in ‘Spice’ (4). The rapid emergence of new drugs and the global nature of the phenomenon highlight the importance of international cooperation in this area. Global updates at the forum will look at the appearance and use of these substances and how they are monitored, detected, risk-assessed and controlled. Presenting an update from the European Union, Roumen Sedefov, EMCDDA Head of Supply reduction and new trends, will explore the question ‘Is the future already here?’ New psychoactive substances were detected in the EU in 2011, via the European early-warning system, at the rate of around one per week (5). Challenges posed by emerging psychoactive substances for prevention and treatment will also be addressed at the event. Discussions will consider individual substances as well as the broader new drugs phenomenon and the implications for the treatment of acute toxicity and the prevention of use. This session will include insights from hospital emergency departments in the UK; prevention strategists in Poland; and medical experts from the USA who will explore the ‘legal ills’ of synthetic cannabinoids and piperazines. Highlights from the forum will be presented on the EMCDDA website in June. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/4_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0423	2012-05-31	UNK	New ESPAD study shows overall stable drug use among school students and a reduction in ‘heavy episodic drinking’, but no decrease in cigarette smoking	 Overall, the use of illicit drugs among 15–16-year-old school students appears to have stabilised, according to the latest European study of this group published today by the European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs (ESPAD). The report, based on a 2011 survey in 36 European countries, also reveals a reduction in ‘heavy episodic drinking’ (five drinks or more per occasion). But the survey highlights country differences and the need for vigilance where cannabis, inhalant and tobacco use has been seen to rise.  This is the fifth data-collection wave conducted by the ESPAD project, with multi-national surveys carried out every four years since 1995 (1). Over 100,000 school students took part in the latest survey. Of the countries participating, 23 were EU Member States. The 2011 ESPAD report: substance use among students in 36 European countries, available in English, will be complemented by a multilingual summary produced with the support of the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) (2). The EMCDDA includes ESPAD data in its annual reporting on the drug situation and the two bodies work closely together under a cooperation agreement signed in 2007 (3). This cooperation was scaled up in 2011, with the partners vowing to boost joint work and technical cooperation to enhance understanding of long-term drug use trends among this population in Europe. The new survey results show that the increase seen in the use of illicit drugs among this age group in ESPAD countries between 1995 and 2003 has since stalled, with the average prevalence remaining unchanged at 18 % between 2007 and 2011 (11 % in 1995; 20 % in 2003). The vast majority of the students surveyed in 2011 who had ever tried an illicit drug, had used cannabis. Average lifetime cannabis use was reported by 17 % of the students (4), use in the last 12 months was reported by 13 % and use in the last 30 days by 7 % (all unchanged overall). But despite this overall stable picture, the proportion of students who had ever tried cannabis increased significantly between 2007 and 2011 in 11 of the 36 ESPAD countries (and fell in five). The 2011 ESPAD data show that over three-quarters of school students (79 %) had consumed alcohol in the past 12 months and over half (57 %) in the last 30 days, continuing the small decreases witnessed since 2003. In total, 11 countries reported a fall in alcohol use over the past 30 days and in ‘heavy episodic drinking’ over the same period (the latter had increased by 8 percentage points between 1995 and 2007). Also reported is the small decrease to 38 % in this drinking pattern among girls, in contrast to the striking increase seen in the last round of the survey (29 % in 2003, rising to 41 % in 2007). Among boys, the figure was also slightly lower in 2011 (43 % compared with 45 % in 2007). Across 22 countries, more boys than girls still report ‘heavy episodic drinking’ in the past 30 days, although the gender gap shrank from 12 percentage points in 1995 to five in 2011. Lifetime prevalence rates for the use of inhalants, relatively unchanged from 2005 to 2007, increased slightly from 8 % to 10 % between the two most recent surveys. However, inhalants represent the key variable with the largest number of countries (15) reporting significantly higher figures in 2011 than in 2007. Those reporting the largest rises in inhalant use since 2007 are Croatia (increase from 11 % to 28 %) and Latvia (13 % to 23 %), while Cyprus reports one of the most notable drops (16 % to 8 %). The lowest figure was reported for Moldova (2 %). Disappointingly, the overall trend in cigarette smoking in the last 30 days in the participating countries remained unchanged between 2007 and 2011, following decreases between 1999 (35 %) and 2007 (28 %). In the countries with data from all five surveys, 29 % had smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days. Some countries (Monaco, Portugal), on the other hand, reported large increases (13 and 10 percentage points respectively). Of those surveyed in 2011, 6 % had tried one or more other drugs. Use of ecstasy and amphetamines shared second place after cannabis (3 %), while cocaine, crack, LSD and heroin were less commonly reported than cannabis (1–2 %).   Lifetime non-prescription use of tranquillisers or sedatives appeared unchanged across the five waves, with the overall figure fairly stable be¬tween 1995 and 2011 at around 7–8 %. Girls showed statistically significantly higher figures than boys in 18 countries in the latest survey. New analyses of polydrug use (involving two or more licit or illicit substances) show its prevalence to be stable at close to 9 % in the 2007 and 2011 surveys in countries with comparable data. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘Through its repeated surveys, the ESPAD project offers us a crucial window onto country differences and changes in adolescent substance use in Europe. Today’s report underlines an important commitment to monitoring and understanding substance use in this important adolescent population and provides valuable data for further analysis. The EMCDDA presents a summary of the ESPAD findings as part of an enhanced and multilingual dissemination strategy of the project’s results. This essential data will help inform policymakers, promote scientific understanding and facilitate the development of effective interventions for young and vulnerable school students across Europe’. (1) ESPAD surveys are available for 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011. (2) This is the second multilingual summary supported by the EMCDDA. Downloadable today in English, it will be published in the coming months in a further 22 languages. The agency has also provided financial support for ESPAD school survey data collections in the Balkans: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Kosovo (under UNSCR 1244/99). (3) For more on the EMCDDA–ESPAD cooperation see here and in the news. (4) However, there is a huge gap between the top countries (lifetime prevalence) — the Czech Republic (42 % in 2011), France and Monaco (around 38 % each) — and the bottom countries — Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Faroe Islands, Moldova, Montenegro and Norway (4–5 % each). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/3_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0424	2012-05-28	UNK	‘Cooperation in the drugs field must cross borders’, says EU drugs agency chief	 ‘Cooperation in the drugs field must cross borders if we are to build a more accurate picture of the drug situation and responses to it in the EU and its neighbouring countries’, says Wolfgang Götz, Director of the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). The comment comes as the agency prepares to open up its next Reitox meeting to countries outside the EU preparing to collaborate with the agency (1). The four-day event, kicking off tomorrow (29 May) in Lisbon, has been christened ‘Reitox week’ and is the first of its kind (2). Reitox — the European information network on drugs and drug addiction — was set up at the same time as the EMCDDA in 1993 and is now composed of 30 national monitoring centres or national focal points (NFPs) in the 27 EU Member States, Croatia, Turkey and Norway, as well as a focal point at the European Commission. The NFPs — from which the agency draws the bulk of its data — collect and analyse national information on drugs, drug policies and solutions, drawing on various sectors including health, justice and law enforcement. The agency describes the network as the ‘backbone of its work’. In preparation for EU enlargement in 2004 and 2007, the EMCDDA began cooperating with countries outside the EU in 1999, working with EU candidate countries on technical projects to develop national focal points and drug information systems. It began collaborating with Norway in 2001, and in 2003 extended this work to EU candidate and potential candidate countries in the Western Balkans (3). This broader perspective was enshrined in a revised EMCDDA founding regulation, enforced in 2007, which formalised the agency’s transfer of know-how to countries beyond EU borders (4). Reitox week will bring together 45 countries including: the current 30 members of the network, Russia, Kazakhstan and a number of beneficiaries of the European Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) (5) and the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) (6). Through the IPA programme, would-be EU members receive funding and support to prepare for accession. In January this year, the EMCDDA launched its IPA 4 programme (2012–14) to support IPA beneficiaries in preparing to participate in its work (7). The ENP forge closer ties with countries to the South and East of the EU, to strengthen prosperity, stability and security.               ‘This first Reitox week represents an important step forward in our technical cooperation with countries outside the EU,’ says Wolfgang Götz. ‘By bringing all partners around the table for the first time, the event heralds a new era for our Reitox network and will provide added impetus to our cooperation projects’. ‘Once countries join the EU, they are automatically required to participate in the work of the EU agencies’, Götz explains. ‘This is why aspiring EU members are encouraged to play an active role in the work of the agencies before entering the Union to ensure that, on accession, they are fully operational in the specific field’. The agency highlights the added value gained by countries from cooperation of this kind, such as strengthening their national information systems and gaining access to tools and expertise to implement their own national strategies and responses to the drugs problem. Important players in this cooperation are ‘Reitox coaches’, representatives from the more established national focal points assigned to assist newcomers to the network in running national activities according to EU norms. This Reitox coaching model is a valuable means of building partnerships and exchanging expertise between countries within and beyond the EU.  Programme The Reitox week will be structured around two sessions: Part I (29–30 May) — meeting of the new ‘extended’ Reitox network (including training in assessing the information needs of professionals in the countries concerned and discussions on: the role of national drug monitoring centres in drug monitoring and evaluation; data collection and support for interventions on drug-related infectious diseases; demand reduction and best practice). Part II (31 May–1 June) — regular meeting of the 30 Reitox members (including discussions on: the draft EMCDDA work programme (2013–15); the ongoing development of EMCDDA data-collection tools; and information sessions on EU-funded research programmes).   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/fs-1_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0426	2012-04-26	UNK	New drugs detected in the EU at the rate of around one per week, say agencies	 New drugs were detected in the European Union last year at the rate of around one per week, according to the EMCDDA–Europol 2011 annual report on new psychoactive substances released today (1). A total of 49 new psychoactive substances were officially notified for the first time in 2011 via the EU early-warning system (EWS) (2). This represents the largest number of substances ever reported in a single year, up from 41 substances reported in 2010 and 24 in 2009. In 2011, the list of substances registered was dominated by two groups: synthetic cannabinoids (23 substances) and synthetic cathinones (8 substances)(Graph 1) (3). These now represent the two largest drug groups monitored by the EWS and, together, make up around two-thirds of the new drugs reported last year. All of the new compounds reported in 2011 were synthetic. ‘New drugs have become a global phenomenon which is developing at an unprecedented pace’, say the agencies. The improved capacities of national early-warning systems may have also contributed to the rising number of new drugs reported. Some of the newly identified substances were actively sought through test purchases of ‘legal high’ products from the Internet or from specialised shops (see Graph 2). ‘The speed at which new drugs appear on the market challenges established procedures for monitoring, responding to, and controlling the use of new psychoactive substances’, states the report. This in turn has generated greater interest in the phenomenon, as seen through increased national awareness-raising initiatives, new legislative formulations and studies and surveys on the prevalence of use. Highlighted as significant in 2011 was the increasing number and diversity of synthetic cannabinoids (e.g. found in ‘Spice’-like products), of which five new chemical families were detected. (This brought the total number of synthetic cannabinoids reported since 2008 up to 45, the largest drug group now monitored through the EWS). Responding to health concerns, some countries have adopted ‘generic controls’ on chemical families as well as controls on individual substances (4). EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘We now see new drugs marketed in attractive packages on the Internet or sold in nightclubs and on street corners. Whatever the source, the simple fact is that a dangerous game of roulette is being played by those who consume an ever-growing variety of powders, pills and mixtures, without accurate knowledge of what substances they contain and the potential health risks they may pose’. Commenting on the EWS, Götz adds: ‘We must continue to enhance Europe’s ability to detect and respond quickly and appropriately to these developments. This requires networking and the sharing of information and it requires greater investment in forensic analysis and research’. In a follow-up section on the synthetic cathinone, mephedrone, the report shows that 26 EU Member States, Norway and Croatia, now control the substance under drug legislation (with the Netherlands expected to follow suit shortly) (5). Also described in the report is the EMCDDA’s monitoring of the online ‘legal high’ market. The number of online shops offering at least one psychoactive substance or product rose from 314 in January 2011 to 690 in January 2012. Europol Director Rob Wainwright says: ‘The selling of illicit drugs and new psychoactive substances is yet another area where the Internet is abused by organised criminals. We must ensure that law enforcement agencies have the modern operational and legislative tools to combat such cases effectively.' As announced in its Communication ‘Towards a stronger European response to drugs’, the European Commission will propose stronger EU legislation on new psychoactive substances, taking into account the rapid developments in this field and scientific evidence on the risks posed by these substances (6). A 2011 Eurobarometer survey of young people showed that on average around 5 % of young respondents (15–24 years) reported having used ‘legal highs’. These substances were mainly obtained through friends (54 %), at parties or in clubs (37 %), in specialised shops (33 %) or over the Internet (7 %). Over 200 substances (including some sold as ‘legal highs’) have been reported by Member States via the EWS since it was created in 1997.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012/2_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0427	2012-04-19	UNK	EMCDDA report presents latest evidence on heroin-assisted treatment for hard-to-treat opioid users	 A small population of chronic heroin users, once thought to be ‘untreatable’, is now benefiting from a novel type of therapy using medicinal heroin as the substitution drug. In a new report out today from the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), experts describe the development as ‘an important clinical step forward’. The report, New heroin-assisted treatment, provides the first state-of-the-art overview of research on the subject, examining the latest evidence and clinical experience in this area in Europe and internationally (1). The prescription of substitution drugs (e.g. methadone, buprenorphine) has become a mainstream, first-line treatment for opioid dependence, with around 700 000 of Europe’s 1.3 million problem opioid users receiving substitution treatment today. But a small minority of entrenched opioid users repeatedly fails to respond to interventions of this kind. Findings from international trials now suggest that the supervised use of medicinal heroin can be an effective second-line treatment for this small, and previously unresponsive, group. ‘New heroin-assisted treatment is an issue that has attracted much attention, controversy and often confusion’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘With Europe at the forefront of investigating and implementing this novel approach, the EMCDDA is proud to present the findings of the major contemporary research studies on the topic and the clinical and policy experiences of countries providing it. Our purpose in doing this is not to advocate, but to inform. We hope that this report will help policymakers and practitioners draw their own conclusions about this type of treatment within their own national context’. Included in the report are the findings of a review on heroin-assisted treatment by the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group, along with the results of a meta-analysis of key studies undertaken. The Cochrane Collaboration is the world’s leading institution in promoting evidence-based healthcare via systematic reviews of evidence. Supervised injectable heroin (SIH) treatment was first introduced in Switzerland in the mid-1990s in the face of a growing national heroin problem. The new approach was a step on from prescribing heroin to addicts without supervision, practised in the US in the early 20th century and in the UK throughout that century. Over the last 15 years, six countries, within and beyond Europe, have tried and tested this clinical approach (2). As a result, SIH treatment is now legally available to long-term, refractory opioid users in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and Switzerland, while in Spain and Canada it is permitted in the context of research trials only. In 2011, some 2 500 clients were enrolled in SIH treatment in the EU and Switzerland (Table 6). SIH treatment is delivered under direct medical supervision to ensure safety and to prevent diversion of diacetylmorphine (medicinal heroin) to the illicit market. Provided in specialised clinics, open year-round, it aims to reduce patients’ use of ‘street’ heroin and involvement in crime and improve their well-being and social integration. According to the report, the research trials conducted since the mid-1990s provide ‘strong evidence’ that, for this specific group of long-term heroin users, SIH treatment can be more effective than oral methadone maintenance treatment (MMT). Findings show that SIH treatment can lead to: the ‘substantially improved’ health and well-being of this group; ‘major reductions’ in their continued use of illicit ‘street’ heroin; ‘major disengagement from criminal activities’, such as acquisitive crime to fund their drug use and ‘marked improvements in social functioning’ (e.g. stable housing, higher employment rate). Regarding clinical practice, the report reveals ‘a strong consistency’ between countries (e.g. use of guidelines) but underlines that ‘clinical precautions remain vital’. Although mortality was found to be similar for the patients in SIH and MMT, the risk of adverse events, such as fatal overdoses, was higher, underlining the need for emergency training for clinical teams. ‘This type of treatment is not simply a case of offering heroin to heroin users’, adds Wolfgang Götz, ‘but is a highly-regulated treatment regime, targeting a particularly difficult-to-treat group of patients. Although the group treated through this method is small, it is one in which the negative consequences of long-term drug use are pronounced. Treating these individuals effectively has the potential to impact positively on the costs associated with drug dependence’. Economic evaluations carried out in three countries (Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands) report the costs of an SIH maintenance programme to be between EUR 12 700 and EUR 20 400 per patient per year, considerably higher than the cost of MMT (estimated at between EUR 1 600 and EUR 3 500 per patient per year). But the trials show that the higher cost of SIH treatment in this highly problematic target group is compensated for by ‘significant savings to society’, including less spent on criminal procedures and imprisonment. Societal savings per person per year in SIH treatment were estimated at EUR 15 000 in the Netherlands, EUR 13 000 in Switzerland and EUR 6 000 in Germany. According to the report: ‘If an analysis of cost utility takes into account all relevant parameters, especially related to criminal behaviour, SIH treatment saves money’. Looking ahead, the report states that the challenge will be to establish a ‘viable operational system’ to offer SIH treatment to severely affected heroin addicts, without undermining the commitment of other patients to more orthodox forms of substitution treatment. Future studies could investigate the longer-term outcome of SIH patients, different routes of administration of diacetylmorphine (intranasal, oral) or other injectable opioid medications. ‘While SIH may be a useful addition to our treatment “toolbox” for opioid users, it is not a solution for the heroin problem’, concludes the report. ‘But for those among whom the benefit is observed, there are major gains for themselves, their families and society’.

EMCDDA_UNK_0428	2012-03-23	UNK	First EMCDDA Reitox week	 The EMCDDA will open up the May meeting of the Reitox network of national focal points to its partners from: Candidate and Potential Candidate countries to the EU; Eastern and Southern Partnerships countries; and Russia. The meeting, which will include scientific and technical discussions, will be entitled ‘Reitox week’ and takes place in Lisbon from 29 May–1 June 2012. It will be structured around two sessions: the meeting of the ‘extended’ Reitox network on 29–30 May, followed by the meeting of EU Reitox members (EU Member States + Norway, Croatia and Turkey). The objective of the meeting is twofold: to foster exchanges of know-how and experiences between all countries on practical and thematic issues related to the work of the focal points, and to the monitoring of the drug situation at national and European level; to further develop the cooperation framework in the perspective of a future participation of Candidate, Potential Candidate and Neighbouring countries in the work of the EMCDDA.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012-2_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0429	2012-03-23	UNK	World TB Day 2012 (24.03.2012)	 World TB Day raises awareness about the global epidemic of tuberculosis (TB) and efforts to eliminate the disease. One-third of the world's population is currently infected with TB. Due to marginalisation and lifestyle, drug users face higher risks of contracting the disease than the general population. Among the core tasks of the EMCDDA are the monitoring of drug-related infectious diseases among drug users and of measures taken by the Member States in reducing and preventing infectious diseases in this vulnerable population. Several of the agency’s publications address these topics, including the ECDC–EMCDDA joint guidance on the Prevention and control of infectious diseases among people who inject drugs (2011), which explores good public health practices that can support effective policies to reduce infections. Specific guidance on testing issued by the agency in 2010 (Guidelines for testing HIV, viral hepatitis and other infections in injecting drug users), recommends that regular health examinations should be offered to injecting drug users which routinely include testing for blood-borne diseases as well as screening for latent or current TB cases. In spite of low TB notification rates in most countries in Europe, TB remains a serious threat, especially for those living with HIV, whose risk of developing TB is estimated to be between 20–37 times greater than among those without HV infection (http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/tb/3is/en/index.html). Earlier testing would ensure earlier treatment for IDUs and lower the risk of infection spreading to the wider population.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012-4_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0430	2012-03-22	UNK	New EMCDDA multicity project on wastewater analysis	 The EMCDDA has recently launched a multicity ‘demonstration project’ to investigate the potential of wastewater analysis as an indicator for estimating community drug use levels. By the end of 2012, the project will have generated comparable data from at least 15 European cities, thanks to an agreed common sampling approach designed to ensure maximum comparability. The project partners met in Lisbon in January to establish a project work plan and key deliverables (1). By sampling a known source of wastewater — for example, a sewage influent to a wastewater treatment plant — scientists can now obtain estimates of the total quantity of drugs consumed by a community by measuring the levels of illicit drug metabolites excreted in urine (2). This demonstration project will provide comparable information in real time on weekly patterns of use, trends and changing consumption habits in the participating cities. Wastewater analysis is an emerging science. While its methods do not provide the type of detailed consumption data currently yielded by drug surveys, its ability to provide timely estimates of illicit drug consumption in a given population make it a useful complement to existing methods for studying drug use trends in Europe. Notes (1) The project is being undertaken by a consortium of researchers from over 10 European countries.

EMCDDA_UNK_0431	2012-03-16	UNK	UK House of Lords publishes report on EU drugs strategy	 This year sees the end of the EU’s current drugs strategy (2005–12) and its second four-year action plan (2009–12). In a report published today, the UK House of Lords European Union Committee looks at what the strategy has achieved, and what should come next. The report welcomes how the EU applies the principle of subsidiarity in this area, underlining the value of the strategy in ‘providing a guiding framework within which Member States can formulate their national drug policies’. Looking to the future, the committee suggests that the next strategy should concentrate on ‘areas where the EU can make a major contribution’, such as the coordination of the fight against drug trafficking. It also underlines the need to encourage the development and improvement of the collection, analysis, evaluation and distribution of information on the drugs issue, praising the EMCDDA for its work in this field. Report summary Source: HOUSE OF LORDS European Union Committee 26th Report of Session 2010–12 The EU Drugs StrategyReport Summary (page 5) This year sees the end of the EU’s current eight-year Drugs Strategy and second four-year action plan. In this report we look to see what the Strategy has achieved, and what should come next. In general, we welcome the practical application by the EU of the principle of subsidiarity in this area. We agree with our witnesses that most aspects of drugs policies should remain within the competence of the Member States. The role of the EU should continue to be to complement, and where possible to strengthen and add value to, the actions of Member States. We also welcome the cooperation in this area between cities and across national boundaries, and call for this to be increased. We believe that the European Drugs Strategy has been of value in providing a guiding framework within which Member States can formulate their national drug policies. In our view, however, previous aims of demand reduction and supply reduction have been too broadbrush to be useful as a guide to EU policy formulation: they should not therefore be treated as the main objectives of the next EU Strategy. Instead, we recommend that the new EU Drugs Strategy should be better focused and, while respecting the present division of competences, should seek to give a useful sense of direction to national policies. We suggest that the next Strategy should concentrate on the areas where the EU can make a major contribution. The first of these areas is coordination of the fight against drug trafficking. On the legislative front, the EU should better focus on money laundering and strengthen provisions on the seizure of the proceeds of crime. On the operational side, through Europol and other agencies, it can directly contribute to the fight against drug trafficking. And we believe EU aid and EU research programmes should devote more resources to crop diversification away from drugs, and to drug related research projects. The Strategy should also make clear that anti-trafficking measures must guard against displacing the problem to countries and regions not previously affected where they can cause significant damage to civil society; must have regard to the human rights of those involved; and must be subjected to evaluation as demand reduction measures have been. We believe that working on these fronts will be more productive than revising existing legislation on maximum penalties and newly developed psychoactive substances. We were impressed by the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, and the regard in which it is held around the world. We therefore recommend that any future Strategy should seek to safeguard this agency’s future and should continue to encourage the development and improvement of the collection, analysis, evaluation and distribution of information on the drugs issue so that Member States can learn from each other’s experiences and benefit from each other’s research. We were struck by the evidence we heard from Portugal on the effectiveness of their public health orientated national drug strategy. We therefore recommend that the new Strategy should use the EU’s public health obligations to encourage the inclusion of harm reduction measures in the national policies of the Member States. It should be recognised that health policy is as important as law enforcement policy in this field and that education also has a significant role to play. Finally, we believe that the formulation and adoption of a new Drugs Strategy offers a golden opportunity to widen the public debate, to consider as dispassionately as possible the different policies and approaches and to narrow the gap between theory and practice, and thus to achieve a better consensus about the best way of proceeding. We urge the EU institutions, in particular the Commission and the Parliament, to make sure that this takes place. Recommendations (Chapter 6: EMCDDA-related) 140. We welcome and endorse the universally high esteem in which the agency is held. We believe it should continue to work towards common definitions and a common data collection practice, and should encourage Member States to do likewise. We urge the Government to do all it can to assist in this. 141. We agree that the EMCDDA should play no part in grading the success or failure of the policies of the different Member States. However we believe that the agency, without compromising its policy neutrality, could do more to indicate when the evidence points to a particular policy having been successful. 142. During the current negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014–2020, and during the annual budgetary negotiations, the Government should ensure that the resources of the EMCDDA are at least retained at their current level in real terms. European Union Committee The House of Lords European Union Committee considers EU documents in advance of decisions being taken on them in Brussels, in order to influence the Government’s position and to hold them to account. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012-0_en

The event is an initiative of the EU-funded Recreational Drugs European Network (ReDNet) project and the EMCDDA. This conference will offer an opportunity to share scientific knowledge on the nature of new compounds and the clinical and legal challenges faced by multidisciplinary professionals today. Full conference details at: www.rednetproject.eu/conference Speeches will be broadcast online at: virtual.feis.herts.ac.uk/broadcast Themes International experts in the field will deliver over 60 presentations around four key themes: Clinical challenges Analysis of the major chemical, pharmacological and clinical issues regarding novel compounds. What is the nature of these compounds? What are their effects on human health? Novel prevention models for novel compounds How can we develop effective prevention models in response to these emerging compounds? How can these models become valuable tools for the dissemination of information to inform policy, practice and the general public? Legal challenges Exploration of the major challenges posed by the rapid diffusion of novel compounds in terms of national/international legislation. How can we develop a better understanding of the complex interplay between established illicit drugs and new products? How can we contribute to novel legislative solutions? Substance misuse and lifestyle The exponential shift in the drugs field is a reflection of broader social processes. Do these differ from country to country? What are the emerging trends? We live in times of globalisation and rapidly developing information technology. Does this change have an impact on substance use? And if so, how? 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012-1_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0433	2012-01-25	UNK	Speech by Wolfgang Götz, EMCDDA Director	 ‘We are facing a growing challenge to the way we protect our citizens from drug trafficking and the collateral damage that it brings with it’, said EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz in Brussels today on the eve of International Customs Day. Addressing participants at the opening of the World Customs Organization’s ‘Global forum on combating illicit drug trafficking and related threats’, he spoke of the ‘many opportunities’ but unfortunately also the ‘new threats’ brought by our modern joined-up world. The full trsanscript of the speech is given below. Good morning Mr Mikuriya, Secretary-General of the World Customs Organization, Dear colleagues working nationally and internationally to combat drug trafficking and related threats… May I start by thanking the World Customs Organization for inviting me to this important meeting. The topic we will address over the next three days is one of growing significance and I am pleased, on behalf of the EMCDDA, to be able to make a contribution to this important debate. [Threats] I think we all recognise that we live in an ever more interconnected, open and faster-moving world. We can see this in the global economy, we can see this in the way the lives of our young people are changing and we can see this in the way new technology is transforming the way we communicate. Our modern, joined-up world brings with it many opportunities, but unfortunately it also brings new threats. Drug trafficking and the trafficking of precursor chemicals, together with the related issues of money laundering and corruption, are foremost amongst these. And I am very pleased that the WCO has prioritised these topics and made them the subject of discussion at this forum. [EMCDDA] The task of my agency, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), is to provide the European Community and its Member States with factual, objective, reliable and comparable information on the drugs problem in Europe. And this morning, I would like to say a few words — from the perspective of a monitoring and analysis centre — on how we see the drug problem evolving in Europe and how these developments are challenging our current policies and responses. [Responses to drug trafficking] When I look at developments in drug trafficking in Europe today… I see more innovation, I see organisations that are quick to adapt to threats and exploit opportunities, and I see drug traffickers taking on a more global perspective in their operations. My message to you is a simple one, and one that I know is endorsed by Mr Mikuriya and the WCO… in fact it is the theme running through the agenda for this meeting… We need to ensure that our responses to drug trafficking are equally innovative, equally quick to adapt to changing circumstances, and equally global in their outlook. From our monitoring work in Europe, I can say with certainty that whenever we see Member States basing their action on sound analysis, sharing information and working closely together we see concrete evidence of effectiveness. [Developments in Europe] Let me now tell you about some of the developments in Europe and why these developments convince me of the value of acting collectively within the European Union and how they underline the need for a stronger and more coordinated global response. If I had been addressing this meeting a few years ago, I would have talked essentially from the perspective of countries that were drug consumers rather than producers. This is certainly not the standpoint I can take today. Europe is an important producer of drugs, both for its own market and the export market — particularly for synthetic drugs such as amphetamine and ecstasy. For example, Europe is probably the world’s largest illicit amphetamine producer and although much is consumed within Europe, large quantities are exported to long-standing consumer markets in the Middle East and Arabian Peninsula and sold as Captagon tablets. [Cannabis] We also see significant cannabis production in Europe today. The situation developing with cannabis is an interesting example of how drug markets are evolving. We have seen a shift towards domestically-grown herbal cannabis and away from imported cannabis resin. 26 of our Member States now report the existence of indoor production sites. There are obvious benefits to suppliers of producing the drug near to its intended marketplace and avoiding the need to cross external borders. The collateral damage on local communities associated with this sort of production is of growing concern and there are an increasing number of reports on the involvement of organised crime gangs and violence linked to domestic production. The high-potency cannabis produced by these intensive methods may have greater negative implications for public health. And the link between drug crime and other criminal activities is illustrated by the fact that some of the people working in cannabis plantations have been trafficked into Europe, and may themselves be subjected to violence or other forms of abuse. Despite what we are seeing in terms of increased domestic production, Europe still has a large appetite for cannabis resin. Most of the cannabis resin for the European market is produced in Morocco and enters Europe via the Iberian Peninsula. Although seizures are down a little, we are not seeing the big decreases one might expect. We do have some evidence to suggest that the infrastructure developed for cannabis trafficking is being used for other drugs such as cocaine as well as for other illicit cargoes — which demonstrates why we have to take a holistic approach to these problems. We will shortly be releasing a major new analysis of the European cannabis market… One of the things that strikes me in this analysis is the fact that more and more cannabis is entering Europe through our eastern borders and I think this will be a growing problem for the future. We do not yet see much cannabis resin used in the EU originating from Afghanistan, for example, but we know from UNODC sources that Afghan production has increased dramatically, making the country by volume probably the biggest global producer of cannabis resin, with production estimated at between 1 200 and 3 700 tonnes in 2010. Currently most of the Afghan cannabis is consumed outside Europe but this could change in the future and we need to remain alert to this kind of potential market development. So if we look at future threats posed by cannabis trafficking in Europe as a whole, we see a complex picture which includes domestic production, links with other criminal activities and potentially new source countries. I think this example has wider implications. Overall, we need to take into account a more dynamic situation in markets and trafficking routes. This is illustrated, not only by the fact that cocaine is now being trafficked on the cannabis route, through North Africa, but also by reports that suggest increasing interaction between heroin and cocaine trafficking operations. Historically, our analysis has tended to be drug and route specific, but I think this can no longer continue — and in my view this is an important topic for our discussions at this meeting. [Cocaine] Over the last few years, the development of the European cocaine market has brought with it several unexpected problems. At the international level, the development of new drug trafficking routes through West Africa has added instability and corruption to a region that was already fragile. All of us here recognise that drug use feeds corruption and undermines social development. We are also seeing new innovative trafficking methods, such as the incorporation of cocaine into plastics, food or clothes and subsequent removal of the drug in so-called secondary extraction laboratories that are located within Europe. This kind of market innovation presents new challenges to our law enforcement efforts. The cocaine market continues to develop and we now receive reports of trafficking routes that use East Africa to smuggle cocaine into Europe. There were also reports of some major seizures in eastern Europe, a region where, until now, cocaine use has been very low. All these developments show that drug traffickers are quick to adapt to interdiction successes and actively seek out new routes and vulnerable entry points to Europe. We are faced with the challenge of keeping pace with an innovative and fast-moving opponent. But it is important not to be too pessimistic on our performance as we also have examples of how these challenges are being met by better targeted and more coordinated responses. [Coordinated responses] We know from seizure data that cocaine enters Europe through different ports and airports. Large cocaine seizures have been reported in recent years by Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Italy, Bulgaria and France. While in many cases these seizures were the result of the work of national law enforcement bodies, there have also been seizures that were the result of cooperation between European countries. A good example for this is certainly MAOC–N (the Maritime Analysis and Operation Centre – Narcotics) that is located in Lisbon. MAOC–N allows participating countries to share information and prepare interventions targeting cocaine trafficking across the Atlantic. The organisation has facilitated the seizure of more than 60 tonnes of cocaine since its inception in 2007 — or to put that more concretely, cocaine with a wholesale value of around 5 billion euro. A similar body — CECLAD–M — also operates in the Mediterranean. The ‘European pact to combat international drug trafficking’ is another promising initiative which will allow better information exchange and cooperation among European law enforcement bodies to disrupt the cocaine trade. It is not only important that we coordinate our activities at the international level. We also need to see closer and more coordinated working practices developed between customs, border control and police services. Again there is some evidence that we are moving in the right direction… The work done by CEPOL and Europol to increase the integration of European customs services into law enforcement training programmes is a good example — as well as the efforts being made to better use information from customs services in the assessment of the threats posed by serious and organised crime. The importance of such joined-up working practices between police and customs services becomes evident when we look at some of the successes we have had in disrupting heroin trafficking on the Balkan route. [Heroin] When we look at the use and availability of heroin in Europe today, I have to say I am becoming increasingly, if cautiously, optimistic that this drug will play a less important role in our drug problem in the future. Effective interdiction is not the only reason for this. We have also seen impressive investment in demand-reduction measures — and nearly half of those with heroin problems are now in treatment. An example of successful supply reduction work can be seen in the recent heroin drought experienced in a number of European countries from early 2010. This drought can be directly attributed to successful cooperation between police and customs services — in this case joint work between Turkish and EU services (in particular UK). There is increasing evidence that this kind of activity — combined with measures in and around Afghanistan and with a comprehensive demand-reduction strategy within Europe — is impacting positively on Europe’s most important drug problem. We do then have grounds for optimism and grounds to counter the voices of those who still claim — mistakenly in my view — that we are wrestling with an intractable problem. However, I have to temper my optimism with realism and we are clearly facing some major new challenges… [Synthetic substances and precursors] Synthetic substances are becoming a more significant problem on both the European and international drug markets. Here we are increasingly playing a game of cat and mouse with drug producers. Our successes are met with new strategies and we are struggling to keep up with developments. For example, we have seen in Europe that more intelligent enforcement targeting the precursor chemicals for ecstasy has had a major impact on availability of this drug on the European market. However, this has been met by a more chemically sophisticated response from the illicit trade, which has undermined the progress made. If we look at synthetic drug production in Europe today, we see that the illicit trade is not only manufacturing the precursor chemicals themselves but also importing uncontrolled chemicals that can easily be converted into precursors once they are in Europe. ['Legal highs'] A linked and growing challenge for drug policies is the expanding market in uncontrolled new psychoactive substances, the so-called ‘legal highs’. Around one new chemical a week is reported to the European early- warning system on new psychoactive drugs, the mechanism established to monitor this area in the EU. We are seeing the development of a dynamic new market with considerable effort being invested in identifying substances that can be used as alternatives to controlled drugs. These substances are packaged and marketed sophisticatedly, often sold via the Internet, and are of growing popularity in various parts of the world. Many of these chemicals are difficult to detect and highly active, meaning that a small-volume package can contain many thousands of doses. As control measures begin to target these products, they are likely to pose a new and difficult challenge for customs and border control services. Let me conclude by saying that I have outlined a number of areas where we are facing a growing challenge to the way we protect our citizens from drug trafficking and the collateral damage that it brings with it. The importance of a meeting such as this one is that it provides an opportunity for us to ensure that we meet these challenges effectively. Criminal organisations involved in trafficking have short-term goals, a high degree of flexibility and no concern for the damage that they inflict. We, on the other hand, have values, respect decision-making processes that are accountable, and have the long-term goals of preserving society and the life and wellbeing of our citizens. Within this framework we need to be as proactive, flexible and innovative as those we face. How we better achieve this will be the subject that this forum should focus on over the next three days — I wish you a productive meeting. Thank you very much for your attention. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2012-3_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0434	2011-12-15	UNK	Latest analysis highlights changing trends in illicit production of amphetamine in Europe	 Increased capacity and sophistication in the illicit amphetamine market are among developments reviewed in the EMCDDA–Europol analysis Amphetamine: a European Union perspective in the global context (1). Published today, the report describes how patterns and trends are changing in the production and trafficking of this widely used synthetic stimulant and the chemicals used in its manufacture. It also looks at the people and organisations involved, and the scale of the problem in a global context. According to the report, amphetamine can be termed a ‘European drug’, with data suggesting Europe to be world’s number one producer of the substance and a major consumer market. While, globally, methamphetamine is more widely used, amphetamine has stabilised as the most widely consumed stimulant drug in Europe today after cocaine. And in many countries, especially in the north and east of Europe, it is the second most widely used illicit drug after cannabis (2). Yet, say the agencies, while the drug attracts much less attention in the media and policy circles than cannabis, cocaine or heroin, it should not be treated as a ‘secondary issue’. Around 12.5 million Europeans have used amphetamines in their lifetime, some 2 million having used it in the last year (3). European amphetamine markets are therefore ‘highly profitable business opportunities’ for organised crime, states the report. Although some amphetamine is manufactured in small ‘kitchen’ laboratories, the vast majority is produced in middle to large or ‘industrial size’ facilities run by criminals operating across Europe and beyond. Distinct production and trafficking areas are outlined in the report (4). Large-scale production and organised crime involvement are found mainly in northern Europe, notably in the ‘north-west criminal hub’ (centered on the Netherlands and to a lesser extent Belgium), where there are signs of increased yield and professionalism (e.g. use of custom-made industrial equipment). Significant production and trafficking of the drug also occurs in the ‘north-east hub’, notably in Poland where production is reported to be on the rise, although in Lithuania, traffickers have reportedly shifted to producing methamphetamine for key Scandinavian markets. Smaller scale production predominates in central Europe, particularly Germany. Meanwhile the south-east hub (Bulgaria, Turkey) is thought to be the main source of ‘captagon’ (5), although there are signs that manufacturing could be relocating closer to established markets in the Near and Middle East. In the ‘north-west hub’, use of industrial equipment may increase the production capacity and subsequent yield from around 5–8 kg of amphetamine per production batch to up to 30–40 kg. In Poland, the capacity of clandestine manufacturing facilities is reported to have risen from around 3 kg per production batch to between 4 and 8 kg. Commenting on the report, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘Amphetamine is a drug warranting careful attention, despite the fact that its use has remained relatively stable in most European countries over the past decade. I am particularly concerned by our latest analysis identifying the growing scale and sophistication of some producers. With this publication we hope to enhance the understanding of an often overlooked, but nevertheless key, component on the European scene for stimulant drugs’. Amphetamine can be produced at relatively low cost, close to consumer markets. More problematic for the illicit producer however is obtaining the precursor chemicals required to manufacture the drug (e.g. BMK also known as P-2-P). The report notes how increasingly effective international efforts to control the trade in precursors have prompted some illicit manufacturers to bypass regulations by synthesising, rather than purchasing, precursors from so-called ‘pre-precursors’, or by masking them as other non-controlled chemicals before importation. Seizures of the pre-precursor phenylacetic acid (a precursor of BMK), rose sharply in 2009, with a total of almost 42 tonnes confiscated worldwide, compared with some 160 kg in 2008. This prompted the United Nations in January 2011 to place it under the same type of international control as BMK. Despite an increasing trend in Europe for ‘self-production’ of BMK, it continues to be smuggled into the region, often from China and Russia, by organised criminals. Amphetamine users in Europe fall into two distinct groups: socially relatively integrated occasional users (which make up the vast majority) and marginalised problem users. While amphetamine is often seen as a ‘poor man’s cocaine’, being the cheaper of the two drugs, the lower price in times of recession could increase its appeal for potential users. In countries such as Finland and Sweden, use of amphetamine makes up an important part of the drug problem, and accounts for a substantial proportion of those seeking treatment. Europol Director, Rob Wainwright said: ‘The widespread use and production of amphetamine is a big problem in society but Europol is cooperating with its law-enforcement partners in Europe to tackle the challenges involved. We provide on-the-spot assistance to their investigations, dismantle illicit synthetic drug production sites and provide operational analysis. We combat the trade in amphetamine by using intelligence from our partners to detect links between different cases and identify those involved in the production, processing and trafficking of amphetamine and its precursors’. In 2009 in Europe, over 34,000 seizures resulted in the interception of an estimated 8 tonnes of amphetamine powder and 3 million amphetamine tablets. In the 2005–09 period, the largest number of seizures was reported by the UK, followed by Germany and Sweden, while the country reporting the largest quantity of the drug seized was Turkey, followed by the UK and the Netherlands (6). ‘This joint report comes as a strong reminder of the growing threat posed by synthetic drugs. Sadly, nowadays amphetamine can be referred to as a European drug. It is the second most widely used stimulant drug in Europe after cocaine. Most of the attention has been traditionally focused on heroin, cocaine or cannabis. A better understanding of the amphetamines market — production, trafficking and use — seems crucial for a more effective and intelligent policy response’, commented Cecilia Malmström, EU Commissioner for Home Affairs. Notes (1) The report is available in English at: www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/joint-publications and www.europol.europa.eu. It is the third title in an EMCDDA–Europol joint publication series covering key aspects of European drug markets. Amphetamine is a substance belonging to the family often referred to as amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), which covers two main groups of substances: the ‘amphetamines’ (amphetamine, methamphetamine and related substances) and the ‘ecstasy-type’ drugs (including methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and its close relatives methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA)).

EMCDDA_UNK_0435	2011-12-15	UNK	Registration opens for European summer school on illicit drugs	 The Lisbon-based Instituto Superior das Ciências do Trabalho e da Empresa (ISCTE) and the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) are currently collaborating on a summer school programme entitled: ‘Illicit drugs in Europe: supply, demand and public policies’. Registration opens today for the course which will take place in Lisbon from 2–13 July 2012. During the two-week course, EMCDDA scientific experts, ISCTE-professors and policymakers, will prepare participants to meet the complex policy challenges in this field, by providing a multi-disciplinary and inclusive approach to the study of the drug problem, both in Europe and beyond. Week 1 of the summer school focuses on ‘Defining the problems’ and will feature lectures on ‘Problem drug use in Europe’, ‘Drug supply in Europe’ and ‘Detecting new drugs’. Week 2 explores ‘Understanding drug policies and interventions’ with lectures on ‘(Inter)national drug policies’, ‘Preventing drug use’ and ‘Harm reduction’ and ‘Prison health’. The target audiences for the summer school are university students (undergraduate and graduate), researchers, professionals and administrators interested or working in the drugs field. ECTS credits will be given for the courses and students can transfer credits to other European universities using the ECTS-system.

EMCDDA_UNK_0436	2011-12-14	UNK	EMCDDA briefing paper highlights need for range of tools to counter threat of emerging drugs	 ‘The speed at which new psychoactive substances can appear and be distributed now challenges the established procedure of passing legislation to control a substance in each country,’ according to a new publication released today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). ‘Responding to new psychoactive substances’ – the latest briefing in the series Drugs in focus (1) – describes how policymakers are demanding ‘new, faster and effective ways of drug control’ that will protect public health and deter suppliers from circumventing controls. It notes that drug laws are not the only means available to meet the challenges posed by these substances. New psychoactive substances are defined as narcotic or psychotropic drugs that are not controlled by United Nations Conventions, but which may pose a public health threat comparable to that posed by controlled drugs (2). The European early-warning system on new psychoactive substances, operated by the EMCDDA and Europol since 1997, draws on national early-warning systems to collect, assess and disseminate information on new drugs and products containing them. The last two years have seen record numbers identified in Europe – 24 in 2009 and 41 in 2010 – with some 150 now monitored at EU level and preliminary data for 2011 showing no signs of decline. Today’s briefing describes some of the practical and legal obstacles facing Member States when responding to such new substances. Testing products can be time-consuming and expensive which can hinder timely and targeted responses by legislators. New drugs may pose health and other risks to individuals and the general public, yet hard data on these may initially be lacking. Legislative procedures to bring a substance under the control of the specific drug law can take over a year in some countries. And controlling a substance may have unintended consequences, such as the emergence of a more harmful, non-controlled replacement. ‘Member States require the capacity to rapidly identify and scientifically evaluate the increasingly diverse and complex new substances appearing on the market,’ says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘Their response mechanisms should be optimised to act effectively and efficiently to protect public health with the minimum adverse consequences; control under drug law is one of various options that can achieve this’. The briefing underlines the importance of national early-warning systems in detecting and identifying new substances as the first step towards assessing the risks of, and ultimately controlling, potentially dangerous new drugs. According to the briefing, these could be strengthened via the use of quantitative drug monitoring indicators, qualitative research and multidisciplinary information sources (e.g. healthcare, law enforcement). National risk-assessment systems now exist in most Member States to examine the health and social risks of new substances. These are described as lending important support to the legislative process by sending ‘accurate and credible messages’ to the public about potential threats. Targeted research into a substance in question is described as ‘key to providing a firm evidence base for risk assessment and for the ongoing justification of control measures’. Psychoactive substances controlled under criminal law must be clearly defined (i.e. substances not listed in the drug law are not controlled by it). Yet the briefing describes how countries are able to overcome this obstacle with ‘proactive controls’. These include controlling ‘chemical families’ of substances (generic controls) or the analogues or derivatives of controlled drugs (substances with similar structures or effects). In 2010, Ireland introduced legislation prohibiting the sale of any addictive or harmful psychoactive substances for human consumption (3), while Poland banned the marketing of ‘substitute drugs’ (substances or plants used instead of, or for the same purposes as, a controlled drug) (4). Faster processes have been introduced in some countries to overcome procedural delays in placing a new drug under control. Germany, the Netherlands, and more recently the UK (5), have established emergency systems that enable a substance to be placed under temporary controls. Other countries now have fast-track systems to place substances under permanent control by shortening the consultation periods in the law-making process. The briefing states that, while drug laws should address substances that pose major threats, other measures, combined with prevention programmes, could be used to dissuade the use of non-controlled substances of concern. ‘Speed of reaction may be more important than severity’, states the briefing. Existing laws in areas such as consumer protection or medicines might also be considered as options and have already been used to stop the open distribution of new drugs. For instance, regulations requiring that goods on sale are clearly and accurately labelled in relation to their expected use have been invoked to confiscate ‘Spice’ products not labelled in the national language (Italy), or mephedrone labelled as bath salts and plant food (UK). In 2009, Austria classified ‘Spice’ products under non-criminal medicines legislation which proved effective in halting their open marketing and distribution. Young people’s access to new substances can also be reduced by licensing or age restrictions on sales outlets similar to those regulating alcohol and tobacco sales. All these approaches follow recommendations by the United Nations’ Office on Drugs and Crime to concentrate law enforcement efforts on suppliers, rather than criminalising users. ‘Striking the right balance between swiftness of response to new substances, on the one hand, and sufficient scientific evidence and legislative supervision, on the other, is an important policy goal’, states the briefing. Looking to the future, the European Commission, in cooperation with EU Member States, the EMCDDA and Europol, is working on new legislation to better address the control of new psychoactive substances throughout the EU.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/12_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0437	2011-12-09	UNK	EMCDDA launches first European quality standards to improve drug prevention in the EU	 ‘Prevention’ is one of the first issues to be mentioned in the public debate on drugs, but evidence of what works in practice to prevent drug use is often overlooked. Today the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) launches the first European ‘how to’ guide on conducting high-quality drug prevention. Entitled European drug prevention quality standards: a manual for prevention professionals, it will be presented at an international conference hosted by the agency in Lisbon this week (1). Developing and implementing best practice in drug prevention in Europe are goals set by the current EU drug strategy and action plan (2). In line with these goals, today’s manual is the culmination of a two-year project to assess existing guidance in this area and to meet the need for a commonly agreed European framework to improve drug prevention in the EU. With support from the European Commission, the project is the fruit of collaboration between the seven organisations of the ‘Prevention Standards Partnership’, working closely with the EMCDDA (3). Bridging science, policy and practice, over 400 international, European and national experts and stakeholders contributed to developing the standards via a dynamic process involving focus groups, consultations and studies. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘The new manual summarises current evidence on how to conduct good drug prevention in the EU. The aim of the quality standards is not to standardise prevention practice across Europe, but rather to achieve a similar level of high quality, while acknowledging diversity of practice’. ‘Implementing prevention measures correctly with evidence-based components will help ensure effectiveness and efficiency of funding and avoid unintended harmful effects’, he adds. ‘The manual will provide valuable guidance in this respect and allow preventive interventions to reach their full potential’. The standards are designed to be of interest to all professionals who, directly or indirectly, contribute to drug prevention (e.g. psychologists, social workers, teachers, policymakers, service managers, police). They outline the necessary steps to be taken when planning, conducting or evaluating drug prevention programmes and can be used to inform prevention strategy, enhance professional development and assess and develop the organisations providing prevention services. The standards can be applied to a wide range of drug prevention activities (e.g. education, outreach work); settings (e.g. school, community, family, recreational, criminal justice) and target populations (e.g. school pupils, young offenders, families), regardless of the duration of the programme. An eight-stage project cycle is set out in the manual comprising: needs assessment; resource assessment; programme formulation; intervention design; management and mobilisation of resources; delivery and monitoring; final evaluations; and dissemination and improvement. The manual includes real-life scenarios and tips for using the standards and is complemented by a website with additional tools. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/11_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0438	2011-12-05	UNK	International experts to examine the influence of social and economic environments on substance use	 Leading international experts in prevention research will meet in Lisbon from 8–9 December to examine the influence of social and economic environments on substance use. Over 100 participants from some 20 countries will gather at the 2nd International Conference of the European Society for Prevention Research (EUSPR), hosted by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) (1). The EUSPR is a non-profit organisation working to enhance the evidence base on drug prevention in Europe. Among its aims are improving the quality of prevention education and research and promoting the active dissemination of research results. Established in December 2010, the society is based at the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw. The EMCDDA supported its creation (2). ‘Changing health-related behaviour requires comprehensive and joined-up strategies’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘We know that there is no simple solution to preventing drug use and that we need a broad spectrum of interventions that can target groups, individuals and the very environments in which people make choices about drug use’. Entitled ‘Synergy in prevention and health promotion: individual, community and environmental approaches’, the conference will look at the range of prevention approaches employed today (universal, selective, indicated, environmental) (3). It will focus in particular on current knowledge regarding environmental interventions and how they are evaluated. Environmental prevention strategies are those which impact on societies and aim to alter the immediate cultural, social, physical and economic environments in which people make choices about substance use. These can include publicity bans, age controls, tobacco bans, taxation or creating positive school climates. During the conference proceedings the EMCDDA will launch on 9 December the European drug prevention quality standards, setting out the first European framework on how to conduct high-quality prevention (4).  The conference will be preceded on 7 December by a workshop on ‘Smoking in movies: state of evidence and policy options’. This will present the findings of the largest study to date on the issue of smoking in film and its link to smoking initiation (5). Co-funded by the European Commission, this study was conducted in six European countries (Germany, Iceland, Italy, Poland, the Netherlands and the UK). Its results will be published in the December issue of the journal Tobacco control. The event will take place at the Conference Centre in Cais do Sodré. Journalists may attend the session launching the European drug prevention quality standards on 9 December at 12 noon. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/10_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0439	2011-11-29	UNK	World AIDS Day 2011	 1 December: World AIDS Day The EMCDDA and ECDC have contributed to a special issue of Eurosurveillance marking World AIDS Day. This edition contains an editorial and scientific papers raising awareness on the need for scaling up HIV/AIDS prevention in Europe. » Information on the seminar (click to view) The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) will join forces in Brussels on the eve of World AIDS Day (30 November) to host a scientific seminar at the European Parliament. The seminar will bring prominent speakers to Brussels to discuss with MEPs ways to prevent and control infections among people who inject drugs and to address the risk and burden of HIV and AIDS-related infections, such as hepatitis B and C in EU countries. Seven interventions, one aim: no infections among people who inject drugs During the seminar, the agencies will invite MEPs to explore seven interventions to reduce infectious diseases among people who inject drugs and learn more about ways to prevent HIV and related infections in this vulnerable group. These interventions are presented in a new guidance document published by the agencies last month: Prevention and control of infectious diseases among people who inject drugs.  Many European countries have achieved substantial progress in recent years in preventing drug-related infections. Drug injecting, however, remains a major cause of infectious diseases across Europe. The interventions proposed in the document range from the supply of injection equipment, testing and vaccination to the treatment of infections and drug dependence. These are best applied in combination and ideally in the same venue for maximum effect. Common blood-borne viruses among people who inject drugs include H IV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. These are mainly spread through the sharing of needles, syringes and drug preparation equipment or unprotected sexual contacts. Commenting on the guidance EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘Blood-borne infections can spread very rapidly among people who inject drugs, which in turn can lead to high treatment costs, lost productivity and human suffering. A central message in our report is that we now know how to prevent infections in this group. The challenge before us is to ensure that this understanding is translated into effective services. Europe can still do better in reducing the public health burden posed by these preventable diseases’. ’Prevention of infections among people injecting drugs is achievable and effective – if it is properly executed’, stresses ECDC Director Marc Sprenger. ‘That is why we need closer cooperation between all sectors of health care to win the trust of people who inject drugs and offer them health services as outlined in our joint guidance’. The ECDC–EMCDDA joint publication is published together with a ‘Guidance in brief’ summary and with two technical reports providing a full assessment of the evidence. Notes The seminar will be held in Room A5E-2, Altiero Spinelli Building at the European Parliament in Brussels on 30 November 2011 from 16:30 to 18:00. Contact: Caroline.Daamen@ecdc.europa.eu Tel.

EMCDDA_UNK_0440	2011-11-28	UNK	EU drugs agency hosts 2011 ESPAD meeting in Lisbon	 The EMCDDA and the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) pledged to scale up their cooperation today in a joint statement adopted at the 2011 ESPAD project meeting. The event, hosted by the EMCDDA in Lisbon (27–29 November), brings together participants from 39 European countries. ESPAD data provide crucial information on substance use among 15- to 16-year-old school students and are routinely included in the EMCDDA’s annual reporting on the drug situation in Europe. In the statement, the partners vow to boost joint work and technical cooperation to enhance understanding of long-term drug use trends in Europe. Cooperation between the EMCDDA and ESPAD began in the mid-1990s and was formalised by a ‘cooperation framework’ agreed in 2007. This agreement recognised the mutual benefits of joint activities to: exchange information and expertise; improve the availability, quality and comparability of school survey data; and gain analytical insight from the data available in this area. So far this cooperation has delivered positive results, such as joint ESPAD–EMCDDA analyses of polydrug use; joint multilingual publishing projects; and EMCDDA-supported ESPAD data collections in several Balkan countries. Based on the encouraging experiences to date, the two partners reaffirm today the long-term value to be achieved through close technical cooperation and the sharing of expertise. In the joint statement they agree, among others, to: develop an enhanced dissemination strategy of ESPAD findings (including a multilingual approach); work together to ensure harmonisation of methods and to support methodological development; develop a joint work programme to contribute to long-term sustainability of the ESPAD network (e.g. joint analyses, data sharing); and meet regularly to review joint activities. High on the agenda at this week’s meeting are the 2011 ESPAD data collections and the analysis of findings. During the proceedings, participants will hear the experiences of investigators in new ESPAD countries: Albania, Liechtenstein and the Republic of Srbska. In addition, thematic discussions will address a range of topics, including: methodological issues; alcoholic beverage drinking patterns; polydrug use; the use of synthetic drugs; and predictors of, and the impact of environmental factors on, cannabis use. Today’s statement underlines the commitment of the two partners to monitoring and understanding substance use in this important adolescent population. This in turn will help to inform policymakers, promote scientific understanding and facilitate the development of effective interventions for young and vulnerable school students. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/fs-6_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0441	2011-11-15	UNK	Drugs report: Commissioner Malmström calls for vigilance on synthetic drugs and asks more anti-trafficking efforts	 The Annual report 2011, released today by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), shows drug use to be relatively stable in Europe, with some positive signs that cocaine use may have peaked and that cannabis use continues to decline among young people. But signs of stability in the use of the more established drugs are offset by the emergence of new threats. These include the increased availability of synthetic drugs, the rapid appearance of new substances and widespread 'polydrug' use (the use of more than one type of drug at one time). Also highlighted in the report are new concerns over the potential for HIV outbreaks among people who inject drugs. Commenting on the findings, European Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmström, said: 'I welcome the latest report from the EMCDDA. Whilst there are some positive trends regarding cocaine and cannabis use, we must remain vigilant, especially on the use of newer, synthetic substances. Law enforcement authorities must also continue to tackle the organised crime groups behind drug trafficking. The Commission remains firmly committed to supporting this agenda. This is also why I will soon be proposing rules on the confiscation and recovery of assets involved in serious crime, including drug trafficking'. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0442	2011-11-15	UNK	EU drugs agency releases new analysis of Europe’s changing opioid problem	 Heroin use continues to account for the largest share of drug-related diseases and deaths in the EU. The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) estimates that there are over 1.3 million regular opioid users in the EU and Norway. And around half (51 %) of the drug users entering specialised treatment in Europe report opioids as their main problem drug (1). Latest data published today show levels of regular opioid use to be relatively stable in Europe (see Chapter 6). But despite these indications, ‘the characteristics of Europe’s opioid problem are changing’, says the agency. Clients in treatment for opioid problems are older (2), fewer of them inject and there are reports of the use of opioids other than heroin in some parts of Europe. Also highlighted are developments in the heroin market and new concerns over the potential for HIV outbreaks among injectors, particularly in marginalised communities.  The comments come today as the EMCDDA launches its Annual report 2011: the state of the drugs problem in Europe in Lisbon. The average prevalence of problem opioid use in the EU and Norway (between 3.6 and 4.4 cases per 1 000 adults aged 15–64) is slightly lower than in Australia (6.3), the USA (5.8) and Canada (5.0), and considerably lower than in Russia (16) and Ukraine (10–13). Injecting drug use on the decline People who inject drugs are among those at the highest risk of experiencing health problems related to their drug use, such as blood-borne infections (e.g. HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, C) and overdoses. In most European countries, injection is mainly associated with opioid use although, in a few, it is associated with the use of amphetamines. Levels of injecting among opioid users entering treatment vary considerably between countries, from under 10 % in the Netherlands to over 90 % in Latvia and Lithuania (Chapter 6, Figure 13). However, data from treatment clients indicate an overall decrease in opioid injection (particularly heroin injection) in Europe (Figure TDI-7). A five-year analysis of trends in heroin users entering treatment shows that the proportion of those reporting injecting is declining in most European countries. And in the most recent data, under half (40 %) of all those entering treatment for opioid problems are regular injectors (Table TDI-17, part ii).  Rising concern over synthetic opioids Increasing misuse of opioids other than heroin is reported in Australia, Canada and the USA. Most of these substances are used in medical practice, as pain relievers (e.g. morphine, fentanyl, codeine) or as substitution drugs in the treatment of heroin dependence (methadone, buprenorphine). The report underlines the lack of information, and need for increased monitoring, on the misuse of these products in Europe and expresses concern around reports of the use of synthetic opioids produced illicitly. Some countries in Europe report that synthetic opioids have displaced heroin from the marketplace. In Estonia, three-quarters of those entering treatment now report fentanyl as their main drug. Fentanyl use is also reported in a number of other countries, particularly in eastern Member States. This drug, a synthetic opioid considerably more potent than heroin and particularly associated with overdoses, is likely to be manufactured illicitly, with the most important production sites thought to be located in countries bordering the EU (3). In Finland, buprenorphine is the most frequently reported primary drug among those entering treatment. Currently in Europe, around 5 % of those entering treatment for drug problems report opioids other than heroin as their primary drug, amounting to around 20 000 patients (see box, Chapter 6). Disruption in supply of heroin to Europe — new analysis Explored today is the availability of heroin on the streets of Europe and reasons for a recent instability in the market (see boxes, Chapter 6). ‘It is likely that a combination of factors may have played a role in disrupting the supply of heroin to parts of Europe, causing mainly short-term but severe shortages in some markets’, states the report. The availability of heroin is reported to have dropped sharply in a number of countries at the end of 2010 and early 2011, with the ‘drought’ being particularly evident in Ireland and the UK. Elsewhere — Italy, Slovenia, Russia and Switzerland — shortages may also have been felt, although the extent is less clear. However, heroin supply in other countries remains unaffected. Among the possible explanations proposed for the apparent heroin shortage in Europe are: the diversion of the drug to markets in Asia; a fall in opium production in Afghanistan in 2009; and an opium poppy blight affecting major Afghan poppy-growing provinces in 2010. However, a recent review of the evidence suggests that successful cooperation between Turkish and EU police forces is likely to have played an important role (4).       The agency notes the difficulties in tracking drug availability in Europe and the need to better understand how opium production influences consumer markets. This is especially important given the latest UNODC 2011 Afghanistan Opium Survey (October 2011) which reports increased Afghan production. Overdose deaths — just the tip of the iceberg? Over 7 600 fatal overdoses were reported in the EU and Norway in 2009, with opioids associated with the majority of these. According to the agency, many of these deaths could have been prevented. But studies suggest that overdose deaths may be just the tip of the iceberg. In a special review on drug-related mortality published alongside today’s report (5), the EMCDDA estimates, for the first time, that there may be around 10 000 to 20 000 problem opioid users dying each year in Europe, mainly from overdose, but also from other causes (e.g. diseases, suicide, trauma, etc.). Most victims are male and, on average, in their mid-30s.    The review looks at the ‘excess mortality’ in regular opioid users (risk of death compared with the general population) and finds that their risk of dying is 10 to 20 times higher than for their non-drug-using peers. The report underlines the role that services, particularly opioid substitution treatment, can play in saving lives and reducing the human costs of long-term drug problems.  ‘Reducing the mortality and morbidity related to drug use is central to European drug policies’, states the Annual report. Under evaluation in some countries are programmes targeting periods known to be risky for opioid users (e.g. leaving prison, dropping out of treatment). Innovative interventions in this area, such as overdose training and take-home doses of naloxone (which blocks the effects of opioids) are now becoming more common in the EU. Risk of HIV outbreaks among drug injectors Over the last decade, gains have been made within the EU in addressing HIV infection among injecting drug users — these include a greater availability of prevention, treatment and harm-reduction measures (6). Latest European data show that the average rate of newly reported HIV cases continues to fall in Europe, reaching a new low of 2.85 new cases per million population (in total around 1 300 cases). Here the overall EU situation compares positively, both in a global and a wider European context. Nevertheless this year’s report reveals worrying new developments. HIV epidemics among drug injectors continue to pose a major public health problem for many countries bordering the EU (see Chapter 7, Figure 15). And with budgets for drug services across Europe becoming overstretched in the economic downturn (7), a danger also exists that countries may be less able to provide adequate responses to those most at risk of infection. ‘Over the last 10 years a proactive, pragmatic and evidence-led approach has delivered real gains in reducing drug-related HIV infection across the EU’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz today. ‘We cannot forget, however, that injecting drug use still accounts for over 2 000 HIV/AIDS-related deaths in the EU every year’. Given the problems facing many EU countries, Götz underlines the need for vigilance in this area: ‘Policymakers must not take their eyes off the ball when it comes to this primary public health objective, especially as conditions for future drug-related outbreaks may now again exist in some Member States. The historical evidence is clear that without effective interventions, HIV infection can, and does, spread quickly among people who inject drugs’. In July 2011, Greece — historically a low HIV-prevalence country — reported a large outbreak of new HIV infections among drug injectors (170 cases at the time of writing) (8). Recent increases in newly-reported infections have also been noted in Bulgaria, Estonia and Lithuania indicating continued potential for HIV outbreaks among injecting drug users in some countries (see Chapter 7, Figure 16). A recent EMCDDA expert meeting (October 2011) also identified further HIV increases among drug users in Romania and worrying changes in risk factors in Hungary. The rate of reported new HIV diagnoses (per million population) in 2009 related to injecting drug use remained relatively high in Estonia (63.4), Lithuania (34.9), Latvia (32.7) Portugal (13.4) and Bulgaria (9.7). Some 700 000 in substitution treatment in Europe Around 1.1 million Europeans are estimated to have received treatment for illicit drug problems in the EU, Croatia, Turkey and Norway in 2009. For opioid users, both drug-free and substitution treatment are available in all of these countries. Five EU countries (Denmark, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and the UK) offer heroin-assisted treatment for a small number of chronic heroin users who have failed in other treatment approaches (see box, Chapter 6). Some 700 000 opioid users received substitution treatment in Europe in 2009, compared with 650 000 in 2007. ’While levels of treatment provision for opioid users are impressive in some countries, coverage still varies greatly and is very low in other countries’, says João Goulão, Chairman of the EMCDDA Management Board. Around 95 % of these treatments are provided in the 15 pre-2004 EU Member States (see Chapter 6, Figure 14). The EMCDDA estimates that about half of Europe’s 1.3 million problem opioid users have access to substitution treatment, a level that is comparable to those reported for Australia and the United States and higher than that reported for Canada. China reports much lower levels, while Russia, despite having the highest estimated number of problem opioid users, has not introduced this type of treatment (see Chapter 6, Table 11; Chapter 1). Treatment costs and quality assurance through guidelines Ensuring the highest treatment quality and best treatment outcome for the lowest possible cost are priorities in the current financial climate. A special EMCDDA review out today (9) states that treatment is cost-beneficial from the societal perspective. The review maps the main funding sources for drug treatment in a number of European countries and summarises the available data on this issue. Also published today is a review of guidelines for the treatment of drug dependence. It shows how almost all European countries now have drug addiction treatment guidelines, illustrating a growing commitment to developing evidence-based practice in this area. Over 140 sets of guidelines were identified from across Europe in 23 European languages. These focus largely on opioid substitution treatment and aim to help practitioners make informed choices (10). Commenting today, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘Our report clearly shows the value of European cooperation and coordination in the drugs field. We see this in many areas: information sharing and joint actions are increasingly impacting on the cocaine and heroin markets; developments in public health responses are allowing more drug users than ever before to access services. This progress is real and has been underpinned by a strong EU strategy which has allowed Member States to identify priorities, share knowledge and act collectively. Such an outlook is essential if Europe is to continue to respond to the new challenges that the evolving European drug problem now presents’ (11).   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/8_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0443	2011-11-15	UNK	Policies and responses must be fit to face the challenges of the next decade, says drugs agency chief	 The Annual report 2011: the state of the drugs problem in Europe is ‘one of contrasts’, says the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). Launched today in Lisbon, the report shows drug use to be relatively stable in Europe, with some positive signs that cocaine use may have peaked and that cannabis use continues to decline among young people. But signs of stability with some of the more established drugs are offset by new threats. Explored in the report are developments in the synthetic drugs market, the rapid appearance of new substances and widespread polydrug use. Delivering the agency’s annual assessment, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘Europe’s drug policies and responses must now be configured to face the challenges of the next decade’. Cocaine — has the bubble burst? Over the last 10 years, cocaine has established itself as the most commonly used illicit stimulant drug in Europe, although most users are found in a restricted number of western EU countries. Around 14.5 million Europeans (15–64 years) have tried cocaine in their lifetime, around 4 million having used it in the last year (Chapter 5, Table 9). But new data presented today raise the question as to whether its popularity has now peaked. Recent surveys of cocaine use reveal some positive signs in countries most affected. Denmark, Spain, Italy and the UK for example — four of the five countries with highest levels of use — report some decline in last-year cocaine use among young adults (15–34 years), echoing the trend observed in Canada and the United States (Chapter 5, Figure 10; Figure GPS-14, part ii) (1). Recent targeted surveys in recreational settings in some countries have also shown a decrease in cocaine use. ‘The financial burden associated with regular cocaine use may make it a less attractive option in countries where austerity is now the order of the day’, states the report. The average retail price of cocaine in most EU countries ranges between EUR 50 and EUR 80 per gram (Chapter 5, Table 8; Table PPP-3, part i). The drug’s ‘positive image’ as part of an affluent lifestyle, is also being challenged by a growing recognition of cocaine-related problems (e.g. hospital emergencies, treatment demand and deaths). Around 17 % of drug users entering specialised treatment report cocaine as their main problem drug (Figure TDI-2, part ii). And around 1 000 cocaine-related deaths are reported annually in Europe. Cocaine use and heavy episodic (‘binge’) drinking often go hand in hand. Recent studies found that over half of the cocaine dependent users in treatment were also alcohol dependent (see box, Chapter 5) (2). Member States are now reporting improved therapeutic responses and positive experiences in treating problem cocaine users. The number of cocaine seizures continues to rise in Europe (from 56 000 in 2004 to around 99 000 in 2009 — Table SZR-9), yet the volume seized and purity of the drug have fallen considerably in recent years. The total quantity of cocaine intercepted in Europe peaked in 2006, and since then has halved to an estimated 49 tonnes in 2009 (Chapter 5, Table 8). While cocaine trafficking routes via west Africa may be on the decline, there is evidence of increased activity in the east of Europe. Cannabis — declining trend explored  Around 78 million Europeans — one in five adults aged 15–64 years — have tried cannabis in their lifetime, around 22.5 million of them having used it in the last year (Chapter 3, Table 4). This makes cannabis still Europe’s most commonly consumed illicit drug. But the latest European data confirm the general stabilising or downward trend in cannabis use among young adults (15–34 years) cited in previous EMCDDA Annual reports (Chapter 3, Figure 5). Surveys of schoolchildren (15–16 years) mirror this decline (Health behaviour in school-aged children/HBSC survey 2006–10, Table EYE-10). Decreases in tobacco smoking may be exerting some influence on cannabis trends in Europe, where the two substances are commonly used together (Chapter 3, Figure 6). A comparison between the last two ESPAD school surveys (2003 and 2007) in 23 EU countries showed an overall reduction in last-month cigarette smoking (from 33 % to 28 %) and cannabis use (from 9 % to 7%). Other possible explanations include lifestyle, fashion, replacement with other drugs and current attitudes to cannabis. A recent Eurobarometer survey published by the European Commission in July 2011 showed that regular cannabis use was rated a ‘high risk’ to health by 67 % of the young respondents (15–24 years) (3). The extent to which changes in drug policy influence cannabis use is a much debated question. Data presented in the report show no simple association between recent drug law changes and levels of cannabis use (see box, Chapter 3). Regular cannabis use in Europe remains a cause for concern: some 9 million young Europeans (15–34 years) have used cannabis in the last month. Young men appear to be at most risk of becoming frequent cannabis users (Chapter 3, Figure 7), a factor which can be addressed in targeted prevention activities. Europe’s appetite for cannabis is reflected in annual seizures of around 700 tonnes of the drug (approximately 600 tonnes resin; 100 tonnes herbal) (Chapter 3, Table 3) (4). Over the last decade, European cannabis policies have often tended to direct law-enforcement efforts towards traffickers rather than users. Yet offences related to cannabis use continue to rise, suggesting a possible disparity between policy and practice (Chapter 2, Figure 4). Synthetic drugs — an increasingly complex market Previous EMCDDA Annual reports have shown how suppliers of ‘legal highs’ keep one step ahead of controls by quickly offering new alternatives to banned products. Today’s report reveals a similar cat-and-mouse game in the area of precursors, the chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs (see box, Chapter 4). Synthetic drugs, including ecstasy (MDMA, MDEA, MDA) and amphetamine are manufactured illegally in Europe from imported precursor chemicals. The report shows how producers are using sophisticated techniques to bypass regulations intended to prevent the diversion of these precursors. These include: synthesising precursors from ‘pre-precursors’ or masking them as non-controlled chemicals, to be reconverted after importation. Recent fluctuations in the ecstasy market illustrate this phenomenon. Following successful measures to limit the diversion of its precursor PMK, it now appears that manufacturers are using a range of pre-precursors, including safrole, as their starting material for MDMA. Some 1 050 litres of safrole and safrole-rich oils were seized in 2009/10, mostly in Lithuania. Following a scarcity of MDMA in ecstasy tablets reported in the last two EMCDDA Annual reports, there are now signs that it may be on the rebound. Recent reports show increasing availability of MDMA — for example in the Netherlands, the country most closely associated with ecstasy production, high-dosage tablets have been found. Around 11 million Europeans have tried ecstasy in their lifetime, 2.5 million in the last year (Chapter 4, Table 7). And around 12.5 million Europeans (15–64 years) have tried amphetamines in their lifetime, around 2 million in the last year (Chapter 4, Table 6). Latest five-year trend data show last year use of ecstasy and amphetamines among young adults (15–34 years) to be overall stable or declining (Chapter 4, Figure 8). Europe is still the biggest producer of amphetamine in the world. Significant methamphetamine use and supply in Europe, however, has historically been restricted to the Czech Republic and Slovakia. But as reported in previous Annual reports, methamphetamine now appears to be becoming more available in parts of northern Europe (e.g. Norway, Sweden and Latvia), where it may be partially replacing amphetamine. Rapid emergence of new drugs and growing interplay between the ‘legal highs’ and illicit drug markets The rapid emergence of new non-controlled psychoactive substances (often sold as ‘legal highs’) represents a growing challenge, both in Europe and internationally (5). Following the record 41 new drugs notified to the EMCDDA and Europol in 2010 (compared to 24 in 2009), preliminary data for 2011 presented today show that there are no signs of decline. So far in 2011, 39 substances have been reported via the European early warning system (EWS). Measures to identify new substances are increasingly proactive — over 150 substances are now monitored through the EWS (see box, Chapter 8). The most recent EMCDDA snapshot of online retailers of ‘legal highs’ (July 2011) identified a record 600 online shops purportedly selling psychoactive products (6) and revealed a wide variety of new products on offer. More sites also appeared to exercise caution via restrictions on deliveries or disclaimers and warnings (e.g. health, legal). Highlighted today is the growing interplay between the ‘legal highs’ and illicit drug markets. Non-controlled psychoactive substances (e.g. mixtures of cathinones, piperazines or phenethylamines) may be tableted as ecstasy and sold on the illicit market. While recently the controlled drug PMMA has been identified in some products sold as ‘legal highs’. Mephedrone, a drug being placed under control in the EU (7), appears to ‘cross to both sides’, being sold as both a ‘legal high’ online and also, in some countries, via the same illicit supply networks as used for drugs such as ecstasy and cocaine. The rapid spread of new drugs is pushing Member States to rethink and revise some of their standard responses to the drugs problem. In 2010, both Ireland and Poland rapidly passed legislation to limit the open sale of psychoactive substances not controlled under drug laws. Other countries have responded via existing health protection or medicines legislation. The European Commission is currently reviewing how Europe monitors and acts on new substances to ensure that responses remain up-to-date and fit for purpose (8). ‘The fast moving and increasingly joined-up world we live in is mirrored by an increasingly fast moving and joined-up drug market which appears quick to adapt to both threats and opportunities’, says Wolfgang Götz commenting at today’s launch. ‘This is reflected, not only in the sheer number of new substances appearing on the market, but also in their diversity and in how they are produced, distributed and marketed’. The Director concluded: ‘We need a proactive strategy that allows us to rapidly identify new drugs and emerging trends so that we can anticipate their potential implications. We also need to coordinate our responses across Europe as, without doing so, individual national efforts are likely to prove ineffective. These two factors are crucial if we are to stay ahead in this rapidly developing game of cat and mouse’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/7_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0444	2011-11-14	UNK	Update — risk of HIV outbreaks among drug injectors in the EU	" Over the last decade, gains have been made within the EU in addressing HIV infection among injecting drug users — these include a greater availability of prevention, treatment and harm-reduction measures. Other factors, such as the decline in injecting drug use in several countries, are also likely to have played a role in the decrease in the number of new HIV infections. The latest data show that the average rate of newly reported HIV cases continues to fall in Europe, reaching a low of 2.85 new cases per million population in 2009 (in total, about 1 300 cases). Here, the overall EU situation compares positively, both in a global and a wider European context (1,2). Nevertheless, this year’s EMCDDA Annual report notes some worrying developments in respect of HIV among injecting drug users. In July 2011, Greece — historically a low HIV-prevalence country — reported an outbreak of new HIV infections among drug injectors (170 cases at the time of writing) (3,4,5,6,7,8). Recent increases in new infections have also been reported by Bulgaria, Estonia and Lithuania, indicating a continued potential for HIV outbreaks among injecting drug users in some countries (see Figure INF-2 in the 2011 Statistical bulletin). At a recent EMCDDA meeting (October 2011), national experts noted further HIV increases among drug users in Romania and potentially worrying changes in risk factors reported in Hungary. Despite the declines in HIV infections among drug injectors in the European Union over the last decade, complacency must be avoided. HIV infection can spread rapidly in vulnerable populations of injectors especially if service provision is low. Interventions (especially needle and syringe programmes, opioid substitution treatment, diagnosis and anti-retroviral treatment) can be effective in reducing the spread of the virus among drug injectors. Joint European guidelines on the prevention of HIV and other infections among drug injectors were launched in October 2011 by the European Centre for Disease Control and the EMCDDA. HIV epidemics among drug injectors also continue to pose a major public health problem for many countries bordering the EU (see Annual report, Chapter 7, Figure 15) (2). Within the EU, the current financial situation means that budgets for drug services are likely to come under increased scrutiny. It is therefore important that the social and financial costs of potential new HIV outbreaks, as well as the guidance on what kinds of interventions are likely to prove most effective in this area, are borne in mind when making decisions on the provision of services. Apart from the direction of trends over time, the actual rate of reported new HIV diagnoses (per million population) in 2009 related to injecting drug use remained relatively high in Estonia (63.4), Lithuania (34.9), Latvia (32.7), Portugal (13.4) and Bulgaria (9.7), suggesting ongoing transmission. Injecting drug use accounts for over 2 000 AIDS-related deaths a year in the EU. Greek report on the HIV outbreak in drug injectors Following the first warning of the outbreak in Greece (3), the EMCDDA commissioned a rapid analysis of the situation with regard to the latest epidemiological data and prevention measures being taken. The report notes that: During 2011, the number of newly reported cases of HIV infection among injecting drug users in Greece has sharply increased. By the end of July, 113 cases had been reported in the Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention’s surveillance system while, from 2001 to 2010, the number of reported cases ranged from 3 to 19 a year. There were no changes reported in testing policy that could explain this increase. The overwhelming majority of new cases have been detected in Athens. Preliminary data suggest that 62% of the reported injecting drug users were of Greek origin, 15% were immigrants and 23% were of unknown ethnicity. Prevalence of antibodies to HIV among injecting drug users ranged from 0.3–0.8% during the years 2002–2010. In the first seven months of 2011, a sharp increase was observed in all data sources. In 2011, molecular analysis revealed that 22 out of 23 positive samples (96%) were found to belong to injecting drug user networks. Analysis suggested that the origin of the virus was from Asia (12 cases), Greece (7 cases) and from South-western Europe (Portugal and Spain) (3 cases). A number of hypotheses exist in regard to the possible contributory factors for the increased number of new HIV cases: they include increased levels of sexual and drug-related risk behaviour, and the absence of comprehensive HIV-prevention programmes. It has also been suggested that other factors, including targeting of drug injectors by the police may have inhibited service uptake or encouraged more risky forms of use. Considering the estimated number of problem drug users, Greece has relatively few low-threshold programmes for drug injectors. The opioid substitution programme — a measure with high efficacy in preventing HIV transmission among injecting drug users — has a waiting list of five to seven years. At the end of June 2011, 5 573 drug users were reported to be actively enrolled in opioid substitution programmes in Greece. However, it was also reported that 7 428 (3 500 in Athens) additional applications for treatment were pending, resulting in relatively low coverage of opioid substitution treatment (see Figure HSR-1 in the 2011 Statistical bulletin). All HIV-positive injecting drug users, including illegal immigrants, are offered priority access to opioid substitution treatment and anti-retroviral therapy. Anonymous HIV/AIDS screening and counselling, as well as anti-retroviral therapy for HIV-positive people and their sexual partners, are provided for by law and are widely available. Syringe and injecting equipment exchange or distribution programmes are available, but their coverage is very limited (see Figure HSR-3 in the 2011 Statistical bulletin). A number of steps are being taken to address the HIV outbreak, with a focus on improving the availability of prevention and health interventions for drug injectors. These include: 	Intensification of programmes providing needles, syringes and condoms in downtown Athens (January 2011); A switch in the kind of syringes being offered (from high to low dead space syringes) is under way (September 2011); Systematic HIV screening of injecting drug users in treatment programmes has been initiated (September 2011); An awareness campaign directed at injecting drug users was implemented in the centre of Athens (March 2011); A molecular epidemiology surveillance programme was initiated to describe the transmission networks, determine the origin of HIV strains and to identify index cases (May 2011); A major restructuring of opioid substitution programmes is also underway, and is expected to eliminate the waiting list by the end of 2011.   "	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/update1_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0445	2011-11-11	UNK	EMCDDA celebrates scientific writing with new award	 Five scientific papers judged to enhance understanding of the European drugs problem will be acclaimed on Monday evening in Lisbon in a new award ceremony hosted by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and its Scientific Committee (1). The prize, to be awarded annually in Lisbon, celebrates scientific writing in this area of key concern to EU citizens. The inaugural event, on 14 November, will be held in the margins of the EMCDDA Scientific Committee meeting. It takes place on the eve of the launch of the Annual report 2011: the state of the drugs problem in Europe. Over 50 eligible entries, from 13 countries (12 EU + Norway), were received in this first year from a variety of disciplines, nationalities and languages. The entries were analysed by a jury consisting of members of the EMCDDA Scientific Committee and scientific staff on the criteria of: scientific significance; EU policy relevance; originality and creativity; and clarity and quality of writing. The articles were published in 2010 in peer-reviewed scientific journals, with the primary author based in an EU Member State or Norway. The five winners (three male, two female) will receive a non-monetary prize for the following papers: ‘Successful treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection in severely opioid-dependent patients under heroin maintenance’, primary author, Bernd Schulte, BPH, cand. PhD (Germany); ‘Estimating the prevalence of drug injection using a multiplier method based on a register of new HIV diagnoses’, primary author, Gregorio Barrio Anta, MD, PhD (Spain); ‘Tweaking, bombing, dabbing and stockpiling: the emergence of mephedrone and the perversity of prohibition’, primary author, Fiona Measham, PhD (United Kingdom); ‘Evidence for the effectiveness of sterile injecting equipment provision in preventing hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus transmission among injecting drug users: a review of reviews’, primary author, Norah Palmateer, MSc, BScH (United Kingdom); and ‘Mortality among drug users after discharge from inpatient treatment: an 8-year prospective study’, primary author, Professor Dr. philos, Edle Ravndal (Norway). The importance of scientific publishing has been underlined regularly by the Scientific Committee and the  upcoming prize reflects this. Abstracts of the winning papers will be available online in English, along with translations in German, French and Portuguese in an effort to share findings in non-English speaking countries. Commenting on the initiative, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘Our Scientific Committee provides a strong voice for scientific standards and I welcome its initiative for lauding papers of merit in our field of drugs and drug addiction. Ensuring that the findings of European research are made available to the policy and practice community is an important issue. I hope this award will become a useful channel for disseminating these results’.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/6_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0446	2011-10-12	UNK	Seven ways to reduce infections among people who inject drugs	 Seven interventions, one aim: no infections among people who inject drugs. In a new guidance document out today, EU agencies ECDC and the EMCDDA have joined forces to identify seven interventions to reduce and prevent infectious diseases in this vulnerable population. Many European countries have achieved substantial progress in recent years in preventing drug-related infections. Drug injecting, however, remains a major cause of infectious diseases across Europe. The interventions proposed range from the supply of injection equipment, testing and vaccination to the treatment of infections and drug dependence. These are best applied in combination and ideally in the same venue for maximum effect. In their guidance report, Prevention and control of infectious diseases among people who inject drugs, the agencies explore good public health practices that can support effective policies to reduce infections. Common blood-borne viruses in this group include HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. These are mainly spread through the sharing of needles, syringes and drug preparation equipment or unprotected sexual contacts. Launching the report during a meeting of infectious disease experts in Lisbon today, the two agencies aim to support countries across Europe in their efforts to reduce infection risks. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘Blood-borne infections can spread very rapidly among people who inject drugs, which in turn can lead to high treatment costs, lost productivity and human suffering. A central message in today’s report is that we now know how to prevent infections in this group. The challenge before us is to ensure that this understanding is translated into effective services. Europe can still do better in reducing the public health burden posed by these preventable diseases’. ’Prevention of infections among people injecting drugs is achievable and effective – if it is properly executed’, stresses ECDC Director Marc Sprenger. ‘That is why we need closer cooperation between all sectors of health care to win the trust of people who inject drugs and offer them health services as outlined in our joint guidance’. The ECDC–EMCDDA joint publication is published together with a ‘Guidance in brief’ summary and with two technical reports providing a full assessment of the evidence (coming soon). The seven recommended interventions are: INJECTION EQUIPMENT: Provide free access to clean drug injection equipment, including sterile needles and syringes, as part of combined multi-component prevention, harm-reduction, counselling and treatment programmes. VACCINATION: Offer vaccinations for infections for which effective vaccines exist, such as hepatitis A, B, tetanus and influenza. For HIV-infected individuals, the pneumococcal vaccine is also recommended. DRUG DEPENDENCE TREATMENT: Provide access to treatment, in particular substitution treatment for opioid users. TESTING: Grant access to testing for HIV, hepatitis C and hepatitis B and other infections, including tuberculosis; ensure the link to treatment. INFECTIOUS DISEASE TREATMENT: Provide antiviral treatment as clinically indicated for HIV-, hepatitis B- or hepatitis C-infected. Tuberculosis treatment is recommended for active cases, while prophylactic therapy should be considered for latent cases. HEALTH PROMOTION: Provide health promotion focused on safer drug use and sexual behaviour to enable people to increase their ability to control and improve their health. TARGETED DELIVERY OF SERVICES: Offer a range of services, delivered according to user needs and local conditions, such as drug treatment, harm reduction, counselling and testing and referrals to other medical services. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/5_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0448	2011-07-11	UNK	Survey results: youth attitudes to drugs	 The European Commission released today the results of its fourth survey exploring  Youth attitudes on drugs (1). This ‘Flash Eurobarometer’ is based on telephone interviews conducted in May 2011 with over 12 000 randomly selected young people (aged 15–24) in all 27 EU Member States. It builds on three earlier Eurobarometer surveys carried out in 2002, 2004 and 2008. Among the issues covered by the survey are: perceptions on the health risks of drug use; attitudes to banning or regulating substances; views on the availability of drugs; and opinions on the effectiveness of policies. For the first time, questions were included on new psychoactive substances (‘legal highs’). On average, around 5 % of the young respondents said that they had used ‘legal highs’, with Ireland (16 %), Poland (9 %), Latvia (9 %) and the UK (8 %) among countries at the upper end, and Malta, Italy and Finland  (all 1 %) at the lower end. These substances were mainly obtained through friends (54 %), at parties and/or in clubs (37 %), in specialised shops (33 %) or over the Internet (7 %). The survey shows that young people’s attitudes to drugs remain substance-specific. Occasional drug use  (used once or twice) was perceived as a ‘high risk’ to health by 23 % of respondents regarding cannabis, compared with 59 % for ecstasy and 66 % for cocaine. Regular drug use was rated as a ‘high risk’ by 67 % of respondents for cannabis and by over 90 % for cocaine or ecstasy. Those who had already used cannabis had a lower perception of its health risks than never-users. Around a quarter of those surveyed (26 %) reported having used cannabis at least once in their lifetime and perceived it to be the easiest illicit drug to obtain. Over half (57 %) of the respondents believed that obtaining cannabis within 24 hours was ‘fairly easy’ or ‘very easy’, against 22 % for ecstasy or cocaine (96 % for alcohol, 95 % for tobacco). The survey revealed that 64 % of young people would use the Internet as their main source of information on drugs, while 37 % would talk to friends and 28 % to family. But when asked how they had been informed about drugs issues in the past year, the Internet came in third position (39 %), behind media campaigns (46 %) and school prevention programmes (41 %). (However, figures show that the Internet has become a more significant drug-related information source than in 2008). In terms of drug control and regulation, the majority of respondents (59 %) still support cannabis prohibition,  but this number has declined from 67 % since 2008. Regarding new psychoactive substances, respondents indicated that these should be banned only if they pose a risk to health (47 %) or be regulated in similar ways to alcohol or tobacco (15 %). Around one third of respondents (34 %) felt that these substances should be banned under any circumstances. Also released today is a European Commission assessment of the EU’s mechanism for addressing new psychoactive substances entering the European market (2). Set up in 2005, this mechanism sets out a three-step approach encompassing: information exchange/early warning; risk assessment and potential Europe-wide controls. The EMCDDA contributed to this assessment.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/fs-5_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0449	2011-07-04	UNK	Khat use in Europe: update and policy implications	 ‘The number of khat users in Europe appears to be growing, yet the scale and nature of the problem is poorly understood’. This is according to a new publication on the subject released today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). ‘Khat use in Europe: implications for European policy’ is published in the EMCDDA’s policy briefing series Drugs in focus (1). Khat refers to the young leaves and shoots of the khat tree (Catha edulis), cultivated in the Horn of Africa, Southern Arabia and along the East African coast. The leaves have been chewed for centuries for their mildly stimulating properties and, for many, are part of their cultural legacy and social life. Migration from the Horn of Africa has been associated with the spread of khat use to neighbouring countries, Europe and the rest of the world. The  drug goes by many names: ‘qat’ (Yemen), ‘chad’ (Ethiopia, Somalia), ‘miraa’ (Kenya) or ‘marungi’ (Uganda, Rwanda). Khat contains stimulant substances that have amphetamine-like properties (e.g. cathinone) which, in their pure forms, are internationally controlled substances. The leaves, however, are not controlled and no consistent approach exists to khat in the EU (it is treated as an illegal drug in 15 of the 27 EU Member States and in Norway). ‘The fact that khat is controlled in some, but not all, countries is reflected in both legitimate and criminal transportation networks’, states EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘European khat markets appear to be growing, but data sources remain weak. More research is needed, not only to assess this market, but also to monitor evolving patterns of khat use and the extent of any socio-economic and health consequences’. According to today’s briefing, the two main entry points for khat into Europe are the UK (London) and the Netherlands (Amsterdam), where it is imported, traded and consumed legally as a vegetable product (2). Khat has also been seized on flights to North America, indicating Europe’s role as a transit point to other destinations. And some countries have reported a doubling in khat seizures in the last five years. Over the last three decades, khat has become a major source of employment, income and revenue in producing countries around the Horn of Africa. Given its resistance to drought and low labour requirements, it is now an attractive choice for producers. The briefing notes that ‘development and drug control policies for such countries require coordination and an awareness of the potential impact of European control measures.’ ‘Exact numbers of regular khat users on a worldwide scale do not exist’, states the briefing, ‘however, estimates range up to 20 million’. In Europe, the substance is primarily used by migrant communities. Despite concern that use might diffuse into the general population, there is no significant evidence that this has occurred. Today’s briefing describes how mental health problems have been associated with the excessive use of khat and how users and health workers need to be better informed about its potential health, social and legal consequences. ‘Among migrant communities from sub-Saharan Africa, khat use is both common and commonly overlooked’,  says Chairman of the EMCDDA Management Board, Dr João Goulão. ‘We must ensure that people working with these communities are aware of the need to identify and respond to any negative consequences that can result from the use of this substance’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/3_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0450	2011-06-23	UNK	Drug use in Europe still a major threat to public health	 Drug use in Europe still represents a major threat to public health and is responsible for between 7 000 and 8 000 fatal overdoses every year in the EU. Europe’s drugs problem is also changing, with more problems now associated with the use of stimulant drugs, such as cocaine, and new substances increasingly appearing on the European market. Preventing drug use and offering effective treatment to those with substance use problems are central pillars of Europe’s response to drugs. A key achievement since the 1990s has been the scaling up of care for drug users. Today, at least 1 million people in the EU receive some form of treatment for drug problems per year. And between 50 and 100 million clean needles and syringes are exchanged or distributed to drug injectors in the EU annually. Such measures have been linked to both a reduction in new drug-related HIV infections and an overall decline in levels of injecting drug use. These improvements have not only been quantitative but also qualitative. Interventions today have a stronger evidence base than in the past and evaluation has become a core element of drug policy in many countries. This is also the case at EU level where the EU drug strategy 2005–12 is currently undergoing an external evaluation. The EMCDDA will contribute to this assessment with a trend report showing the main changes over this period in the drug situation and in Member States’ interventions. These developments also reflect the increased focus on public health in European drug policies. One example of this shift is Portugal, whose drug policy has attracted significant attention in recent years both in the media and in policy debates. Portugal’s case study illustrates how it took many years of action against an ongoing severe drugs problem to develop a new drug policy model. While commentators have focused on its controversial decriminalisation of drug use, it should be noted that this is just one element of Portugal’s comprehensive public-health oriented policy. Today this model comes under the spotlight in a new EMCDDA series of Drug policy profiles outlining the development and characteristics of national drug policies in Europe and elsewhere in the world (https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-policy-profiles/portugal). We are continually reminded of the complexity of the drugs phenomenon and that there is no single solution to all of the challenges it presents. We should acknowledge the importance of developing innovative responses and evaluating them thoroughly. Without such an approach, many of the interventions which are today at the heart of our drug policies would simply not exist. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/m-1_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0451	2011-05-18	UNK	EMCDDA Scientific Committee elects new leaders	 The EMCDDA Scientific Committee, meeting in Lisbon this week, elected its new Chair and Vice Chair for the next three years. Dr Marina Davoli (Italian) was elected by an overwhelming majority to the position of Chair and Prof. Dr Gerhard Bühringer (German) to the position of Vice Chair. The Scientific Committee plays a major role in the EMCDDA’s efforts to attain scientific excellence. It is composed of 15 high-level scientists from the EU Member States plus one from Norway, selected through a public selection process based on scientific merit and independence. The EMCDDA Director and Management Board consult the Committee on the agency’s work programmes or on any scientific matter concerning its activity. The Committee plays a pivotal role in the agency’s risk assessment of new psychoactive substances.     Since members of the Committee are appointed in a personal capacity, they are required to provide opinions independently of their country and of the Community institutions. Dr Davoli, who held the position of Vice Chair of the Scientific Committee from February 2008 to May 2011, is the second woman to head the Committee since its establishment in 1995. Trained as a medical doctor and epidemiologist, she is currently Director of Lazio Regional Health Service’s Department of Epidemiology, a centre for drug addiction and the evaluation of healthcare interventions. Dr Davoli serves on a number of scientific advisory boards in Italy and abroad, including the World Health Organization’s international technical expert group for developing guidelines for the treatment of opioid dependence. She is also Coordinating editor of the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Review Group. Prof. Dr Bühringer, a psychologist, has been scientific director of the German IFT Institut für Therapieforschung since 1973 and, since 2005, Professor for addiction research at the Institute of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy at the Technische Universität, Dresden. He also sits on a number of national and international scientific committees and advisory boards, including: the German Centre for Addiction Issues (DHS) and the International Society of Addiction Journal Editors (ISAJE). Both are members of a variety of prestigious editorial boards and peer-review panels and have published extensively in the field of drugs and drug addiction. The EMCDDA wishes the Chair and Vice Chair well in their new functions. It also pays tribute to outgoing Chairman Professor Michael Farrell (Irish) for his valuable contribution in steering the Committee over the last three years. Professor Farrell, who will remain a Committee member, has recently been appointed Director of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC), Australia. During the meeting, the members expressed their gratitude to EMCDDA staff member Margareta Nilson, who has been responsible for liaison with the Scientific Committee since 2005, and who will be retiring from the agency in the autumn after 16 years of service. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/fs-4_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0452	2011-05-13	UNK	First international multidisciplinary forum on new drugs, 11–12 May 2011, Lisbon	 Leading European and international experts on new drugs met in Lisbon from 11–12 May at the First international multidisciplinary forum on new drugs, organised by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). The participating experts were invited for their technical expertise and research in the field of new psychoactive substances and included: forensic scientists; epidemiologists; clinicians; law-enforcement experts; and staff from European and international organisations. In addition to participants from 27 EU countries, Croatia, Turkey and Norway, technical experts attended from: Australia, Belarus, Canada, Hong Kong SAR, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, Switzerland and the United States. The purpose of this technical forum was to: audit the state of play and provide a global overview on new drugs and ‘legal highs’; identify key issues, commonalities and differences in the experience of, and response to, this phenomenon; anticipate future challenges; and begin to chart a comprehensive vision for the future regarding how these substances will impact on drug use, responses and policies. The themes covered were: Global review: perspectives on a dynamic phenomenon Understanding the evidence: forensic science, a key component Epidemiology: auditing current capacity and identifying future priorities Making the most of the evidence: early warning Defining a balanced response agenda A comprehensive vision for the future Concluding remarks A report on the forum proceedings will be made available in the coming weeks. Initial concluding remarks, delivered at the closing session on 12 May by EMCDDA Scientific Director Paul Griffiths, are listed below: The meeting confirmed that the issue of new drugs/’legal highs’ has become a global phenomenon and is developing at an unprecedented pace. This First international multidisciplinary forum on new drugs offered a valuable opportunity to share expert views on how to better coordinate, respond and monitor this issue. A ‘multidisciplinary’ exploration of the issue was considered essential in the face of this multifaceted problem. The value of the ‘global perspective’ on the topic was also underlined and apparent in the updates provided by EU countries as well as by Australia, Belarus, Canada, Hong Kong SAR, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United States. These updates revealed important commonalities and differences between countries in the marketing, use and responses to this phenomenon. A general conclusion emerging from the forum was that there had been a paradigm shift in the drugs field, reflecting broader social processes. We live in times of globalisation and rapidly developing information technology and these changes are impacting on the drugs issue as they are on other areas of modern life. Developments in this area are now posing an increasing challenge to how we monitor, assess and respond to new psychoactive substances. The speed at which this phenomenon is developing is reflected, not only in the sheer number of substances appearing on the market, but also in their diversity and in how they are produced, distributed and marketed. This calls for a re-evaluation of both the information sources we use and the ways in which we disseminate information to inform policy, practice and the general public. In the area of education, prevention and treatment, we need to develop models appropriate to this emerging issue in order to anticipate possible future problems. Developing common concepts, terminology and instruments is essential to allow experiences to be shared and sound cross-country analyses to be formed. The Internet is increasingly an important medium both in terms of communication and as an information source. Underlined at the forum was the value of forensic science and research and the need for further investment in the area of new substances available on the market. An important challenge is the coordination of this work to allow findings to be shared and maximum benefit to accrue. The meeting also underlined the need for a more holistic analysis of the issue to allow us to understand better the interplay between established illicit drugs and new psychoactive substances. Important here is the development of theoretical models that could help predict the substances that may pose particular risks or have the potential to become established. The forum provided an opportunity to audit what we know about the availability and use of new psychoactive substances. An observation from the global updates was the remarkable speed at which these products had appeared in most world regions. However, it was also clear that, although information remains scarce on the prevalence and incidence of the use of these substances, overall in most countries, levels of use appear to be still low compared with those found with the more established illicit drugs. The meeting reviewed case studies that suggested that some of these new substances have the potential to be attractive to consumers and therefore monitoring future trends was clearly an important task. Discussion in the area of policy, focused on the need to understand the costs and benefits of different policy responses and the regulatory context in which they are applied. This meeting provided a valuable opportunity to review how countries were developing different regulatory approaches in this area. A final conclusion was the need to map out the future research agenda, particularly focusing on the need to better understand the possible acute and chronic health implications of the use of these new substances and to identify and monitor patterns and trends in their use. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/new-drugs-forum-conclusion_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0453	2011-05-11	UNK	New drugs becoming available at ‘unprecedented pace’, says report	 New psychoactive substances are becoming widely available at an ‘unprecedented pace’. This is according to the EMCDDA–Europol 2010 annual report on new drugs entering the European market released today in Lisbon (1). In 2010, a record number of new drugs were officially reported to the EMCDDA and Europol via the EU early-warning system (EWS) on new psychoactive substances (2). A total of 41 new psychoactive substances were officially notified for the first time to the two agencies in 2010. This represents the largest number of substances ever reported in a single year, considerably up on 2009     (24 substances) and 2008 (13 substances). The full list of substances notified, annexed to the report, shows a ‘rather diverse’ group, including: synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones, synthetic derivatives of well-established drugs, as well as one plant-based substance.   Under the so-called ‘Spice’ phenomenon (3), 11 new synthetic cannabinoids were picked up in 2010, bringing the total number of these substances monitored by the EWS up to 27. Responding to health concerns, at least 16 European countries have now taken legal action to ban or otherwise control ‘Spice’ products and related compounds. The report gives an account of the 2010 risk assessment of the synthetic cathinone derivative, mephedrone, which led to the decision for Europe-wide controls on the drug in December 2010 (4). A further 15 synthetic cathinone derivatives were detected during the year. Also documented is the first-time appearance of derivatives of two established drugs: ketamine and PCP (phencyclidine). With a large number of new unregulated synthetic compounds marketed on the Internet as ‘legal highs’, the report describes the EMCDDA’s monitoring of online shops selling these substances. Commenting on this year’s findings, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘Given the speed at which new developments occur in this area, it is important to anticipate future challenges. While our early-warning system has recently upped its operational capacity to react rapidly to new substances and products identified, it currently lacks the ability to anticipate emerging threats. This could be addressed by actively purchasing, synthesising and studying new compounds and by improving our capacity for investigative forensic analysis and research at European level’. The European Commission is currently in the process of assessing the functioning of the mechanism through which Europe monitors and acts on new substances (Council Decision 2005/387/JHA). This is aimed at ensuring that Europe’s responses in this area are up-to-date and fit for purpose. Europol Director Rob Wainwright adds: ‘The emergence of “legal highs” is a major feature of Europe’s drugs problem today. This issue was recently highlighted in Europol's Organised Crime Threat Assessment 2011.  We also notice that organised crime groups are increasingly active in producing and distributing drugs which can be associated with ecstasy. Together with our law-enforcement partners in the EU, Europol is determined to combat this phenomenon’ (5). The EMCDDA–Europol 2010 annual report on new drugs was released on 11 May at the 11th Annual meeting of the EMCDDA–Reitox early-warning system (EWS) network and ahead of the First international forum on new drugs (11–12 May, Lisbon). The forum is closed to the media, however a full programme and other information will be available at: www.emcdda.europa.eu/events/2011/new-drugs-forum   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/2_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0454	2011-05-06	UNK	EMCDDA celebrates Europe day with partners in Lisbon	 Europe Day exhibition tent The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) will be hosting an exhibition stand during upcoming Europe Day celebrations in Lisbon from 7–9 May. This year the focus of events will be on young people, in the context of the EU flagship campaign ‘Youth on the move’. The stand will be located in the Europe Day exhibition tent at Praça do Rossio, where staff members will be meeting the public and talking about their work. The initiative is organised by the representation of the European Commission in Portugal, in partnership with the European Parliament office in Portugal, the Presidency of the European Union (Hungary) and the Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Concerts, debates, workshops and theatre will be among the attractions. On 9 May 1950, French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman issued a declaration calling on France, Germany and other European countries to pool together their coal and steel production as ‘the first concrete foundation of a European federation’. This was the first move towards what would eventually become the European Union. Today, 9 May has become a symbol of the European project.  ‘Statistics show that around one in three young Europeans has tried an illicit drug and that young people are confronted with an increasingly wide range of psychoactive substances’, said EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz in the run-up to the exhibition this weekend. ‘It is more important than ever that Europe has a central reference point on drugs to ensure that our responses are effective and based on sound evidence. We look forward to presenting to a young audience at this event some of the results of our work’. The EMCDDA is one of over 30 decentralised agencies located throughout the EU (see below). Established in 1993 and based in Lisbon, it is the hub of drug-related information in Europe. The agency provides the EU and its Member States with a factual overview of European drug problems to support the drugs debate. It consists of a 100-strong team in Lisbon, from some 20 countries, and coordinates and relies on a network of 30 national monitoring centres across Europe (Reitox) to gather and analyse country data. 1st EU agencies’ football cup 2011 and charity donation From Helsinki to Crete and from Lisbon to Vilnius, specialised European agencies have been established to provide services, information, know-how and advice to the European Union, its Member States and citizens.   The EU agencies are involved in many and varied activities: improving health, safety and the environment; safeguarding freedom, justice and security; supporting education, business and innovation; and developing transport and satellite infrastructure. In the context of this year’s Europe Day celebrations, the two Lisbon-based EU agencies — the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) — are organising on 8 May the 1st EU agencies’ football cup at St Julian’s School, Carcavelos (www.stjulians.com). Eleven EU agencies (male teams) as well as the European Central Bank (female team) will be participating in the tournament. In addition to training for the event, the players have also been fundraising for Adroana, a local social housing community in Alcabideche, near Cascais. The money raised will be donated to the project ’12 Dias Diferentes na Adroana’ (12 Different Days for Adroana), which will offer summer activities to around 50 disadvantaged children and teenagers from this community. ‘We are proud to support the work of this valuable project’, says EMCDDA organiser of the tournament Danilo Ballotta. ‘Most of the children’s parents work long hours and the children are left unattended for most of the holiday period. These summer activities are designed to help them make a positive and healthy use of their free time and foster the values of respect, social support and racial and cultural diversity’. ‘Today some 150 colleagues from across Europe have come to the tournament to celebrate Europe Day’, he adds. ‘We hope, not only to play good football, but also to contribute to a better future for these young people’. At the end of the tournament, the agencies will present a cheque to the project at the St Julian’s School playing fields.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/fs-3_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0455	2011-05-05	UNK	Leading experts to review global developments in new drugs and ‘legal highs’	 Leading European and international experts on new drugs will meet in Lisbon from 11–12 May to take stock of what has now become a global phenomenon. The First international multidisciplinary forum on new drugs, organised by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), will provide a comprehensive overview on new psychoactive substances and identify common anchor points to inform future actions. Ahead of the event, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz referred to the dynamic nature of new drugs — often referred to as ‘legal highs’ — and the timeliness of an event of this kind. ‘The rate at which this phenomenon is developing is reflected, not only in the sheer number of substances appearing on the market, but also in their diversity and in how they are produced, distributed and marketed. These developments pose a serious challenge to how we currently monitor, assess and respond to new psychoactive substances,’ he said. The event will focus on early-warning systems, risk assessments and controls as well as options for prevention and treatment. Around 100 delegates will trace how the phenomenon has developed over the last 10 years and compare, through case studies, differing national experiences. ‘The purpose of the forum is to arrive at a comprehensive vision for the future regarding how these substances will impact on drug use, responses and policies’, says Götz. Discussions will be organised around six themes: Global review: perspectives on a dynamic phenomenon Understanding the evidence: forensic science, a key component Epidemiology: auditing current capacity and identifying future priorities Making the most of the evidence: early warning Defining a balanced response agenda A comprehensive vision for the future The participating experts have been selected for their technical expertise and research in the field of new psychoactive substances and include: forensic scientists; epidemiologists; clinicians; law-enforcement experts; and technical staff from the European Commission, Europol and the European Medicines Agency. In addition to participants from the 27 EU Member States, Croatia, Turkey and Norway, experts have been invited from: Australia, Belarus, Canada, Hong Kong SAR, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, Switzerland, Ukraine and the United States. The forum will be preceded by the 11th Annual meeting of the EMCDDA–Reitox early-warning system network. The European early-warning system provides EU Member States with an information exchange mechanism for reporting on the emergence of new psychoactive substances. It is a key element in Europe’s fast-track system for assessing and responding to new drugs (see www.emcdda.europa.eu/drug-situation/new-drugs). The forum is not open to the media, however a full programme and other information will be available at: www.emcdda.europa.eu/events/2011/new-drugs-forum 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/1_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0456	2011-03-07	UNK	Polish dignitaries present drug-related programme of upcoming EU presidency	 Under-Secretary of State at the Polish Ministry of Health, Adam Fronczak, heads a high-level delegation visiting the EMCDDA this week in the context of the upcoming Polish presidency of the EU. The purpose of the visit is to present the programme of the six-month mandate (July–December), review recent changes in Polish drug policy and explore future cooperation and information-exchange between the EMCDDA and Polish bodies working in the drugs field. Key drug-related events of the presidency will include a: •    conference on cooperation between the EU and Eastern Europe/Russia (26–27 October, Warsaw);   •    national drug coordinators’ meeting (21–22 November, Poznán);   •    drugs and driving symposium (17–18 July, Montreal); and •    presentation of the EMCDDA Annual report to the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers (Brussels, November). ‘Providing technical advice and support to EU Member States is an important task of the EMCDDA’, said EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz, at the start of the two-day visit today. ‘It is crucial for us to receive feedback on our work directly from our stakeholders, such as members of this delegation, in order to better meet their needs and expectations’. He referred to the ‘very successful cooperation’ between the EMCDDA and Poland over the years, characterised by excellent working relations with the Reitox national focal point, experts and scientists and regional drug coordinators. Mr Götz also welcomed to the proceedings representatives from the European Commission (Directorate-General for Justice) Paola Tardioli Schiavo and Marie Debieuvre. The work of the EMCDDA and its role as interface between policy and science will be presented over the two- day meeting. Particular attention will be paid to the issue of psychoactive substances not controlled under drug laws. This follows a new law passed in Poland on 27 November last year controlling head shops and ‘legal highs’ (1). The new law, which eliminates the open sale of these substances, came in the wake of 3 500 inspections by the Polish police and state sanitary inspectors in October 2010, resulting in the closure of 1 200 ‘head shops’. The inspections had been prompted by reports from Polish hospitals in the second half of 2010 of poisonings apparently caused by these substances. In this context, the agency will present an overview of Europe’s responses to new drugs, describing its early-warning system on new psychoactive substances and procedures for assessing the risks of ‘legal highs’ at European level. The Polish delegation will respond with an update on the situation in Poland.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/fs-2_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0457	2011-03-04	UNK	EMCDDA to acknowledge excellence in scientific writing	 Europe’s top scientific papers on drug-related topics will be acknowledged this year in a new award launched by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). The prize giving, to take place annually in Lisbon, will celebrate excellence in scientific writing in this area of critical concern to EU citizens. The inaugural event will take place in the margins of the EMCDDA Scientific Committee meeting, being held in the Portuguese capital from 14–15 November. This EMCDDA advisory body is composed of 16 renowned scientists appointed on the basis of merit and independence. Articles eligible for nomination for the award will focus on illicit drugs, although findings on licit substances may also be included. The articles will have been published in 2010 in peer-reviewed scientific journals, with the primary author based in an EU Member State or Norway. Entries may be submitted in any of the 23 languages of the European Union or in Norwegian, along with an abstract in English. The acclaimed articles will meet the criteria of: scientific significance; EU policy relevance; originality and creativity; clarity and quality of writing. The importance of scientific publishing has been underlined regularly by the Scientific Committee as evidence of scientific excellence. The upcoming (non-monetary) prize originated in these discussions. Commenting on the initiative, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘Our Scientific Committee provides a strong voice for scientific standards and I welcome its initiative for lauding the best scientific papers in our field of drugs and drug addiction. Ensuring that the findings of European research are made available to the policy and practice community is an important issue. I hope this award will become a useful channel for disseminating these results‘. The award is now open. Nominations close on 2 May 2011. The jury — composed of members of the Committee and EMCDDA staff — will select up to 10 top articles from a variety of disciplines, nationalities and languages. Notification of the selected articles will also be made via the EMCDDA website and publications.  Editors of journals in which a successful article was published will be informed of the outcome of the award. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2011/fs-1_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0458	2011-01-24	UNK	EU agencies at the European Parliament	 From Helsinki to Crete and from Lisbon to Vilnius, specialised agencies have been established to provide services, information, know-how and advice to the European Union, its Member States and citizens. At an upcoming exhibition at the European Parliament, 29 EU agencies will come together to explain what they do, why they exist and how they impact on the lives of Europe’s 500 million citizens. European agencies have been set up in successive waves since the mid-1970s and today form an important part of the EU’s institutional landscape. ‘The European agencies play a key role in supporting and implementing EU policies and in responding to needs identified by the EU and its Member States,’ says Jukka Takala, Director of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, who currently chairs the Heads of Agencies (HoA) network. ‘Agencies are also making a strong contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy by performing a variety of legal, technical and scientific tasks across a broad range of policy areas’, he adds. The purpose of the exhibition is to raise awareness among MEPs on the role of the agencies and how these bodies can support them in their daily work. In four thematic teams, the agencies will demonstrate how they: help make Europe a safe, healthy and sustainable place to live and work; work for a free, fair and safe Europe; support the European vision for more jobs, improved lives and a better society; and keep Europe moving around the clock. A rich programme of activities will feature live interviews, slideshows, round tables and briefings. The EMCDDA will be exhibiting as part of the Freedom, justice and security thematic cluster. Entrusting the agencies with specific tasks has become an established part of the way in which the EU conducts business today. As the European Parliament, Council and Commission work towards a common approach on agencies, this exhibition takes stock of how far the agencies have come and how they see the way ahead. The event is coordinated by the Lisbon-based European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), which currently presides over the agencies’ Heads of Communication and Information Network (HCIN). Journalists are invited to visit the stand during the four-day exhibition where interviews may be set up with agency personnel. Full programme details are available at: www.emcdda.europa.eu/eu-agencies-the-way-ahead Venue: European Parliament, Brussels, ASP building, 3rd floor, 31.01.2011–03.02.2011. Tel.

EMCDDA_UNK_0459	2010-11-30	UNK	EU drugs agency launches new guidelines for HIV testing in injecting drug users	 More injecting drug users should undergo tests for HIV, viral hepatitis and other infections such as tuberculosis, says the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). In new guidelines published today on the eve of World AIDS Day, the agency describes how, in this group, the uptake of testing is still low in many European countries (1). Infectious diseases are among the most serious health consequences of injecting drug use and can lead to significant healthcare costs. The new guidelines recommend a strategy to increase testing uptake, both in Europe and beyond, that would ensure earlier treatment for injecting drug users (IDUs) and would lower the risk of infection spreading to the wider population. IDUs are vulnerable to a range of infectious diseases due to a variety of risk behaviours and underlying conditions, such as poor hygiene, homelessness and poverty. The EMCDDA estimates that 30–50% of HIV positive IDUs in Europe are unaware of being infected. It also estimates that around 50% of IDUs (varying between countries from 10% to 90%) are infected with viral hepatitis (notably hepatitis C), which can lead to severe liver disease and premature death. Commenting today, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘It is crucial that those infected are aware of their condition so that they can protect their partners and access the appropriate care and treatment. We encourage service providers and healthcare professionals to take a more proactive approach and ensure that clients at the highest risk of contracting drug-related infections are offered testing on a regular basis. Until now, timely diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases has often been too low a priority among professionals in contact with drug users’. Today’s manual provides guidance at a practical level, proposing a series of standard tests to be undertaken regularly on a voluntary and informed basis. Among these are serology tests for HIV, hepatitis (A, B, C, D) and other sexually transmitted infections; general blood tests; and tests for tuberculosis. For high-risk IDUs, these tests should be considered annually, or even bi-annually. The guidelines also offer a package of prevention, primary care and referral routines in relation to IDUs and infections. The guidelines recommend that health providers initiate examination, testing and counselling in IDUs in a variety of healthcare settings (e.g. primary healthcare; special health services for IDUs; low-threshold service centres visited by IDUs; rehabilitation centres; dedicated sexually transmitted infections clinics and prison healthcare facilities). Developed in collaboration with European experts on drug-related infectious diseases, the guidelines are now being distributed across the European Union and globally. They are intended to be of use to thousands of service providers, and may potentially benefit hundreds of thousands of IDUs.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/14_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0460	2010-11-10	UNK	Cecilia Malmström: 'Enhanced monitoring of the movement of illegal drugs across EU borders will help our efforts to tackle organised crime'	 What new challenges and threats is Europe facing in the drugs field? What are the latest legal, social, health and law-enforcement responses? How many drug users are treated in Europe every year? What are the latest trends in drug supply and drug-related crime? These are just some of the issues to come under the spotlight in the Annual report 2010: the state of the drugs problem in Europe being launched today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). Previewing the findings, European Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmström, said: ‘This report provides an important focal point for drugs issues at European level: it is an invaluable source of data and analysis’. European drug policy is based on a balanced approach that deals with the demand as well as the supply of illicit drugs. Drug trafficking remains one of the most profitable activities for organised criminal groups in the EU today. And understanding how the illicit drug market works is a high priority of the ongoing European strategy and action plan on drugs. Many of the chapters in the report open with data on the supply and availability of specific drugs or explore the innovations of organised crime in circumventing controls. ‘The report demonstrates the need for enhanced monitoring across the EU, as part of a coordinated European approach to tackling drug trafficking and organised crime’, said Commissioner Malmström. Evaluating the impact of supply-reduction activities has become an increasingly common theme in the EU policy debate. Yet the report points out that such evaluation is ‘handicapped by the lack of standard indicators and measures’. The European Commission and the EMCDDA joined forces last month, organising a milestone conference to establish standard European indicators on drug supply issues, a target of the EU drugs action plan (2009–12) (www.emcdda.europa.eu/events/supply-indicators). ‘A mechanism for their implementation can be expected in 2011’, states EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘These are crucial information tools to improve our understanding of this area of key importance for European drug policy. They are also a prerequisite to designing more efficient interventions in future against drug trafficking and drug-related crime.’ The Annual report 2010 offers the latest data and commentary on the drug situation across the 27 EU Member States, Croatia, Turkey and Norway, as well as international comparisons. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/10_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0461	2010-11-10	UNK	Europe faces new challenges posed by changes in drug supply and use	 Changes in the supply and use of established drugs and the emergence of a record number of new substances increasingly test Europe’s drug control models, says the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). These challenges are described in the Annual report 2010: the state of the drugs problem in Europe, launched by the EMCDDA today in Lisbon. Among them: sophisticated cocaine smuggling techniques; changes in the stimulant market; widespread domestic cannabis production; and the continuous appearance of ‘legal highs’ designed to replace controlled substances. Cocaine: sophisticated smuggling techniques and growing health concerns Increasingly sophisticated techniques to conceal and smuggle cocaine into Europe are reviewed today in the Annual report. One such technique involves incorporating cocaine base or hydrochloride (HCI) into carrier materials (e.g. beeswax, plastic, clothing, fertiliser) before export, then extracting it in clandestine laboratories set up inside EU borders. Some 25 of these so-called ‘secondary extraction’ laboratories were uncovered in the EU in 2008 (in Spain). These perform a different function from laboratories in South America which first extract cocaine base or HCI from coca leaves or coca paste (see box, Chapter 5) (1). A rise in deaths associated with cocaine use is an additional concern underlined in the report (see box, Chapter 7). Around 1 000 cocaine-related deaths are now reported annually in Europe. In the UK, the number of death certificates mentioning cocaine doubled between 2003 (161) and 2008 (325). In 2008, around 70 000 people entered drug treatment for cocaine problems (powder and crack) in 27 European countries (around 17 % of all new drug treatment clients) (Figure TDI-2, part ii). ‘Too many Europeans still regard cocaine use as a relatively harmless accompaniment to a successful lifestyle’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘But we are progressively seeing that, as cocaine consumption increases, so too does its impact on public health. A message we must convey is that, not only can use of this drug escalate quickly, but it can also result in fatalities, even when intake is occasional and doses are low’. Cocaine sold in Europe is often mixed with ‘cutting agents’ (adulterants) to increase its market value. These may be inert substances (e.g. sugars, starch) or active ingredients that enhance or mimic the drug’s effects (e.g. lidocaine, phenactin, procaine, caffeine). Today’s report highlights the increased use of levamisole as a cocaine adulterant in the USA, where 70 % of the cocaine analysed in July 2009 was estimated to be ‘cut’ with the drug. Available data in some EU Member States suggest that a significant proportion of cocaine seizures analysed contained this cutting agent. Currently only a few European countries monitor cocaine adulterants, underlining the need for improved surveillance and analysis. Prolonged use of levamisole may pose added health risks to cocaine users (see box, Chapter 5) (2). Some 14 million European adults (15–64 years) have tried cocaine in their lifetime, around 4 million having used it in the last year. Cocaine use disproportionately affects a small number of western EU countries, where levels of use are high. Elsewhere in Europe, use remains low (Chapter 5, Figure 7). In the highest-prevalence countries, Denmark, Ireland, Spain, Italy and the UK, surveys show last-year use among young adults (15–34 years) to range from 2.9 % (Italy) to 6.2 % (UK) in 2008 (Chapter 5, Table 8; Table GPS-2, part ii). In the UK and Spain, the two countries with the highest prevalence, data are fluctuating, with 2008 data showing a rise (Chapter 5, Figure 8; Figure GPS-14, part i and ii), but preliminary data for 2009 some decline. There were an estimated 96 300 cocaine seizures in Europe in 2008 (Chapter 5, Table 7). While seizures remain low in central and eastern Europe, they more than doubled in 10 countries there between 2003 (469 seizures) and 2008 (1 212). This could suggest that cocaine trafficking and availability in the region may be on the rise. Amphetamines still a major problem in parts of Europe — volatility in the ecstasy market Use of amphetamines (amphetamine or methamphetamine) remains overall lower than that of cocaine in Europe, with consumption trends still stable (Chapter 4, Figure 6). But in many countries, one of these substances remains the most commonly used stimulant drug. Around 12 million Europeans (15–64 years) have tried amphetamines in their lifetime, around 2 million in the last year (Chapter 4, Table 5). According to the Annual report, problem amphetamine use is mainly reported by countries in the north of Europe and accounts for a sizeable proportion of those entering treatment in Sweden (32 %), Finland (20 %) and Latvia (15 %). Quantities of amphetamine seized in Europe have increased steadily in recent years (2003–08), reaching 8.3 tonnes in 2008 (Chapter 4, Table 4 and Table SZR-12). Problem methamphetamine use remains limited in Europe and largely restricted to the Czech Republic and Slovakia. But the drug appears to be becoming more available in parts of northern Europe (e.g. Norway, Sweden, Latvia, Finland), where it may be being sold as a replacement for amphetamine. Seizures of methamphetamine in Europe have increased in recent years (2003–08). In 2008, 4 700 seizures of the drug were made, amounting to 300 kg. In 2008, a record 458 production sites were detected in the Czech Republic (up from 390 in 2007) (Chapter 4, Figure 5). Methamphetamine production is also reported in Slovakia and in Lithuania and Poland, mainly servicing the Scandinavian market. The consequences and responses to problem amphetamine and methamphetamine use in Europe are explored in a special review released by the EMCDDA today alongside the Annual report (see news release No 12/2010, summary and www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/selected-issues). Trends in ecstasy use in Europe are generally stable (Chapter 4, Figure 6 and Table 6). Around 11 million Europeans have tried ecstasy, around 2.5 million having used it in the last year. Seizures of ecstasy tablets are estimated to have declined by 14 % to 13.7 million tablets in 2008 (compared to 2007 data), while over the period 2003–08, the estimated average price fell by 32 % to EUR 4–10 per tablet in 2008 (range price in most reporting countries). In 2009, the presence of piperazines (3) in ecstasy tablets continued to be commonly reported (alone or in combination with MDMA). These changes reflect an increasingly complex ecstasy market and have a possible impact on users’ perceptions of the quality of the drug. Cannabis: levels of use in parts of eastern Europe now rival or exceed those in western countries Levels of cannabis use appear to be rising in some countries of eastern Europe, in some cases now rivalling or exceeding prevalence levels found in parts of western Europe (Table GPS-2, part ii; Figure GPS-4, part i). In eastern EU Member States, the highest levels of last-year cannabis use among young adults (15–34 years) were in the Czech Republic (28.2 %), Slovakia (14.7 %) and Estonia (13.6 %). In western countries, the highest prevalence was reported in Italy (20.3 %), Spain (18.8 %) and France (16.7 %). Levels of use differ greatly between countries, with the highest prevalence estimate of last-year use among young adults (Czech Republic 28.2 %) being over 30 times greater than the lowest (Romania 0.9 %) (Chapter 3, Table 3). Latest data confirm the general stabilising or downward trend in cannabis use in Europe cited in the previous three EMCDDA Annual reports. But within this trend, diverging patterns are now seen. Among young adults (15–34 years) who report using cannabis in the last year, three major trends are observed for the period 1998–2008 (Chapter 3, Figure 4). Five countries in the north and south-east of Europe — Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Finland, Sweden — stand out for their overall stable and low levels of use (under 9 %). Six countries in western Europe — Denmark, Germany, Spain, France, the Netherlands, the UK — report higher levels of use but with a decrease or stabilisation in recent years. While four countries — Czech Republic, Estonia, Italy, Slovakia — still report rising trends in cannabis use. Data from the European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs (ESPAD) show similar divergence in time trends in cannabis use among 15- to 16-year old school students (1995–2007) (Figure EYE-1, part xi). Europe’s appetite for cannabis is reflected in annual seizures of around 1 000 tonnes of the drug (Chapter 3, Table 2). In 2008, around 900 tonnes of cannabis resin were intercepted in Europe, almost 10 times the volume of herbal cannabis seized (around 90 tonnes). Herbal cannabis, however, is now commonly produced inside Europe (29 European countries reported domestic cultivation in 2008) and, being closer to its intended market, is less likely to be intercepted. The number of seizures of cannabis plants has increased since 2003, reaching an estimated 19 000 seizures in 2008 (Table SZR-5) (4). ‘The public perception of domestic cannabis production is often that of a pot on the windowsill or a few plants in the garden greenhouse’, says Wolfgang Götz. ‘But the reality today is a very different one. Organised crime gangs have woken up to the profits that can accrue from the large-scale cultivation of cannabis near its intended market. The collateral damage of this development is the rising level of violence and criminality within urban communities, which is now triggering new action by national and European law-enforcement bodies’. Around 75.5 million Europeans — one in five adults aged 15–64 years — have tried cannabis in their lifetime, around 23 million of them having used it in the last year (Chapter 3, Table 3). Some 4 million Europeans are estimated to be daily or almost daily users. Around one fifth (21 %) of clients entering specialised drug treatment report cannabis as their main problem drug (around 85 000 clients) (Figure TDI-2, part ii). Yet the number of clients entering treatment for the first time ever for primary cannabis use is declining slightly. Record number of new drugs reported in 2009 A record number of new drugs were officially reported in 2009 to the EMCDDA and Europol via the EU fast-track early-warning system (EWS) (Chapter 8). Twenty-four new psychoactive substances were officially notified for the first time to the two agencies in that year. This represents, not only the largest number of substances ever reported in a single year, but almost double the number notified in 2008 (13). All of the new compounds were synthetic, including three substances with medicinal properties. A new development highlighted in this year’s report is the growing popularity of synthetic cathinones. These are derivatives of the parent compound cathinone, which is structurally related to amphetamine. Over 15 synthetic cathinones are currently being monitored through the EWS. Towards the end of 2009, increased evidence of the use and availability of one of these drugs, mephedrone, prompted the EMCDDA’s extended Scientific Committee to assess the health and social risks of the drug in 2010 (5). In the wake of this risk assessment, Europe is currently considering controlling the substance. Several countries have already adopted measures to control mephedrone (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, France, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Austria, Poland, Romania, Sweden, the UK, Croatia and Norway). Two Member States — the Netherlands and Finland — apply control measures to mephedrone under their medicines legislation. The ‘Spice’ phenomenon — smokable herbal products laced with synthetic cannabinoids — also continues to evolve. Both the names and brand packaging of ‘Spice’-like products diversified, with their psychoactive compounds changing in response to control measures. A total of nine synthetic cannabinoids, from at least four distinct chemical groups, were reported via the EWS in 2009. The appearance of new unregulated synthetic compounds, marketed on the Internet as ‘legal highs’ or ‘not for human consumption’, presents a growing challenge for monitoring, responding to, and controlling the use of new psychoactive substances. Already in 2010, 31 new substances have been detected via the EWS. These include: synthetic cathinones, synthetic cannabinoids, as well as new synthetic substances resembling cocaine and amphetamines (6). In the most recent EMCDDA online snapshot survey of online retailers (early 2010), 170 online shops were identified selling ‘legal highs’ and hallucinogenic mushrooms.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/11_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0462	2010-11-10	UNK	Over 1 million drug users a year in treatment, but considerable challenges remain	 Offering effective treatment to those with substance use problems is a central pillar of Europe’s response to drugs. According to the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), both the quality and quantity of care available to drug users has improved considerably since the 1990s when better access to drug treatment became a drug policy priority. The EMCDDA estimates that at least 1 million people in the European Union receive some form of treatment for drug problems every year. Yet considerable challenges remain for treatment services. Heroin-related problems maintain a firm hold, both inside the EU and at its borders, and budgetary constraints become a reality in the economic downturn. These issues are explored in the Annual report 2010: the state of the drugs problem in Europe, launched today in Lisbon. ‘Over the last decade, important, if uneven, gains have been made in responding to drug problems’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘Treatment provision has grown dramatically and considerable progress has been made in addressing some of the most harmful health consequences of drug use, such as HIV infection. But at a time when effective responses need to be sustained, austerity measures could lead to reductions in treatment services. Current pressure on the public purse may well provoke policy decisions that result in Europe incurring long-term costs that far outweigh any short-term savings’. The report explains how the expansion of treatment has been largely due to the substantial growth in outpatient care, such as psychosocial interventions (e.g. counselling) and substitution treatment (e.g. methadone maintenance). But while underlining the ‘considerable level of treatment provision’ in Europe today, it describes the inequalities that still exist in access to care. Among the barriers to treatment are stringent admission criteria, costs for patients and a lack of human and financial resources. Around 670 000 Europeans receive substitution treatment — a 10-fold increase since 1993 According to today’s report, most progress has been made in the area of substitution treatment, the most common option for treating opioid use in Europe. Some 670 000 Europeans now receive this type of treatment, up from half a million in 2003 and a 10-fold increase since 1993. Several countries have scaled up their provision in the last decade by involving additional service providers, such as general practitioners. Today substitution treatment is available in all 27 EU countries, as well as Croatia and Norway. And it is thought to be reaching around half of Europe’s problem opioid users. The extent to which this treatment is meeting users’ needs varies greatly between countries. In some Member States, under 10 % of problem opioid users receive this type of treatment while, in others, over half of them do so. Only 2 % of substitution treatments delivered in Europe occur in the 12 Member States which joined the EU in 2004 and 2007. The estimated waiting time for substitution treatment can be over a year in some countries (e.g. Bulgaria, Poland and Greece), depending on the programme and location. Responding to new needs — progress made The diverse patterns of drug use in Europe today call for treatment services to respond to a more complex set of needs than a decade ago. With more cannabis, stimulant and polydrug users now in contact with services, there is a growing call for interventions to address problems other than opioid use. The report explores the progress made in responding to new needs. Responses to cannabis problems in Europe include counselling, structured psychosocial interventions and treatment in outpatient and residential settings. Among the innovative approaches developed in some countries (Germany, the Netherlands and the UK) are Internet-based treatments for cannabis problems to reach those reluctant to seek help within the drug treatment system. Treatment specifically for cocaine users has been developed in several countries. With drug treatment facilities in Europe still mostly tailored to opioid users, socially integrated powder cocaine users may be reluctant to enter treatment due to perceived stigma. Targeting this population, Denmark, Ireland, Italy and Austria now offer treatment outside regular opening hours to accommodate work commitments and provide discretion. Over 50 medical drugs have been evaluated for treating cocaine dependence but, as yet, none have been proven effective. However, more than 100 ongoing randomised controlled trials with new substances are now registered. Problems and responses related to amphetamines (amphetamine and methamphetamine) are explored today in a special review published alongside the Annual report (see Selected issue). In general, treatment services are more attuned to the needs of users of these substances in countries where their problematic use is long established (e.g. treatments for methamphetamine use in the Czech Republic and Slovakia). ONGOING ISSUES FOR TREATMENT SERVICES Heroin problems — no signs of decline The importance of effective treatment is highlighted today as data reaffirm that Europe’s heroin problem is no longer diminishing. After a decline in heroin-related problems from the mid-1990s to early 2000s, indicators of opioid trends — new treatment demands, deaths, drug-law offences and seizures — point to an ‘overall stable to increasing opioid problem in Europe’. The EMCDDA estimates that there are around 1.35 million problem opioid users in the EU and Norway most of these heroin users. New data suggest that recruitment to heroin use is still occurring. Based on data from 19 reporting countries, the overall number of those entering treatment, with heroin as the primary drug, increased from 126 720 in 2003 to 144 128 in 2008 (Figure TDI-3, part ii). And between 2007 and 2008, 11 countries reported more users entering treatment for primary heroin use. Between 6 400 and 8 500 drug-induced deaths were reported annually in Europe in the period 1995–2007, most of these associated with opioid use (typically over 85 %). Since 2003, the number of drug-related deaths has been increasing steadily in most European countries. Data published today suggest a modest increase in reported drug-induced deaths in 2008: with estimates of 7 371 cases that year in EU Member States and Norway, up from 7 021 in 2007 (Table DRD-2, part i). The age of those dying has also been increasing, suggesting an ageing population of chronic opioid users (see news release No 13 and Selected issue). For each fatal overdose in the EU, it is estimated that there are 20–25 non-fatal overdoses or around 150 000 per year. These episodes not only result in significant health damage but are linked to the risk of future fatal overdose. The upward trend in heroin-related offences reported in last year’s report is confirmed today in the latest European data: the EU average for such offences increased by 39 % in the period 2003–08. The number of heroin-related offences also increased in 16 reporting countries. Data from 26 reporting countries show that the number of heroin seizures reported in Europe increased from 41 000 to 56 600 in the period 2003–08, the largest number being in the UK (Table SZR-7). While the number of seizures increased, the overall quantity of heroin seized in the EU and Norway fell from around 9 tonnes in 2003 to 8 tonnes in 2008. Yet Turkey, an important transit country for heroin entering the EU, showed a different trend, reporting a record 15.5 tonnes recovered in 2008, a threefold increase since 2003 (4.7 tonnes) (Chapter 6, Table 9, Figure 9; Table SZR-8). Injecting drug use generally stable or declining in Europe, but still a major problem Injecting drug use is strongly associated with severe health problems in drug users, including blood-borne infections (e.g. HIV/AIDS, hepatitis) and overdose. According to the EMCDDA, the latest data from treatment monitoring are encouraging, showing a stable to downward trend in drug injecting. Among heroin users entering treatment, a decline in the proportion of injectors was reported in 13 countries between 2002 and 2007. Latest data show that under half (42 %) of those entering treatment for primary opioid use in Europe report ‘usually injecting’ their drug, while the proportion for those entering for the first time is lower (38 %) (Table TDI-17, parts i and ii). But while drug injecting may be stable or declining, it remains central to Europe’s drugs problem. And injecting is still the most common route of administration for opioid users in many eastern European countries: the highest proportions of injectors among opioid users entering treatment in 2008 were reported by Romania (95 %), Estonia (91 %) and Slovakia (86 %). Concerns: opioid use and injecting in neighbouring countries The public health consequences of drug use in some of the EU’s neighbouring countries are also examined in today’s report. At the eastern border of the EU, UNODC estimates that Russia and Ukraine both have levels of problem opioid use that are two to four times higher than the EU average (EU average: around 4 cases per 1000 population aged 15–64). The problems associated with opioid use in this region include high rates of HIV infection and drug-induced deaths (see box, Chapter 6). Around 1.68 million problem opioid users (mostly injectors) are reported in Russia and between 323 000 and 423 000 in Ukraine (UNODC, 2010). And studies estimate that in both countries around 40 % of them are reported to be HIV positive. The rate of newly reported HIV cases among injecting drug users is much higher in Russia and Ukraine than in other countries and regions of the world, such as Australia, Canada, the USA and the EU. According to the report: ‘The rate of reported new HIV diagnoses among injecting drug users has remained low in most countries of the European Union, and the overall EU situation compares positively in a global context’. Data on newly diagnosed cases of HIV infection related to injecting drug use in the EU suggest that infection rates are still generally falling, following a peak in 2001–02. Of the four countries reporting the highest rates of newly diagnosed infections (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal) all continued their downward trend, with a marked decline in Estonia and Latvia (Chapter 7, Figure 12). Yet, despite declining trends, the rate of new HIV diagnoses was still at relatively high levels in these Member States in 2008, underlining the need to ensure coverage and effectiveness of local prevention practice. ‘The prevention of infectious diseases is an important public health goal of the European Union and a component of most Member States’ drug policies’, says EMCDDA Chairman João Goulão. ‘Europe has made impressive progress in preventing new drug-related infections, but continued effort is essential. The growing and severe drug-related problems now faced by many of our neighbouring countries are not just public health disasters for the countries concerned, they also represent a sizeable threat for the European Union’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/12_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0464	2010-11-10	UNK	‘Drug problems have no age limits’ — more older drug users seeking help, says EMCDDA	 ‘Drug problems have no age limits,’ says the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). In a special review published today alongside its 2010 Annual report, the agency reveals why drug use is no longer simply a ‘youth phenomenon’ (1). Europe is experiencing a pronounced ageing of its population, around a quarter of which will be aged 65 or over by 2050. Statistics published today show that Europe’s drug-using population is also ageing and that meeting the needs of older drug users is a growing issue for treatment services. This is particularly the case in western countries which saw the EU’s first heroin epidemics in the 1980s and 1990s. Focusing on dependent drug users aged 40 or over, the review highlights the ‘severity’ of their needs and ‘poor quality of life’. But it warns that ‘specialised treatment and care programmes for older drug users are rare in Europe’. Data from specialised drug treatment centres and opioid substitution treatment providers show that older drug users now make up a substantial proportion of their clients and, in many countries, this share is growing. On average, around one in five (19 %) of all those entering treatment in Europe are aged 40 or over, while in some countries the figure is close to 30 % (Figure 3). This represents a major increase compared to a decade ago when, in most Member States, the proportion of older clients did not exceed 10 %. Portugal reports the highest share (28 %) of older drug users entering treatment, while Spain reports the highest increase: 15 percentage points since 2000 (Figure 4). Data specifically on substitution treatment show that, in some countries, over half of the clients are over 40. While the largest shares of older problem drug users in treatment are found in western EU countries, in most central and eastern European countries, the over-40s make up a small percentage of problem drug users in treatment. ‘As drug epidemics there began later [late 1990s, 2000s]… these regions can expect, over the next decades, to see increasing numbers of older problem drug users’, states the report. Older drug users in treatment report high levels of unemployment and social isolation and present the chronic physical and psychosocial consequences of long-term drug use (e.g. liver disease, overdose-related damage, depression). Alcohol and tobacco-related problems are also common. With the ageing process in older drug users accelerated, by the age of 40 a dependent user may need a level of care more typically associated with a person 20 years their senior. Current treatment services are usually tailored to younger drug users and staff may be unfamiliar with late-life drug problems or dealing with health and social changes naturally occurring with age (e.g. reduced mobility, cardiovascular disease, death of relatives). ‘It is commonly assumed that people in their mid-30s grow out of drug use’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz, ‘but data from drug treatment centres in Europe show that this is not always the case. Increasingly services are called on to meet the needs of ageing clients who bear the health effects of long-term drug use combined with those of getting older. So far we have been slow to grasp the implications of this change, but it clearly presents a growing issue for both specialised drug treatment services and mainstream health and social care providers alike’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/13_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0465	2010-11-08	UNK	European Commissioner John Dalli visits EMCDDA	 (8.11.2010, LISBON) Mr John Dalli, European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Policy, visited the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in Lisbon this morning for the latest update on the drug phenomenon across Europe. The meeting, with EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz, took place ahead of this week’s release of the Annual report 2010: the state of the drugs problem in Europe. Commissioner Dalli welcomed the report which he said offered a ‘comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the drug situation across 30 countries’. Among the issues discussed at the meeting was the growing number of new substances entering Europe’s illicit drug market. EMCDDA officials explained how, with Europol and the European Medicines Agency, the agency tracks new drugs via the European early-warning system on psychoactive substances. The use of multiple substances including alcohol (polydrug use) was also covered. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz declared that ’Europe’s drugs problem increasingly stems from the combined use of different psychoactive substances, both licit and illicit’. He underlined the need for public health approaches ‘to focus on lifestyles and behaviours, rather than individual substances’. The EMCDDA’s partnership with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control was also described, along with joint work on the prevention and control of drug-related infectious diseases in Europe, namely in relation to data-collection, analysis and dissemination. The Commissioner’s programme in the Portuguese capital continued with an address at a conference on mental health and talks with the: Portuguese Minister of Health, Ana Jorge; Minister of Agriculture, António Serrano; and Secretary of State for Commerce, Services and Consumer Protection, Fernando Serrasqueiro.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/fs-9_en

The agreement was endorsed in the margins of the 15th Ministerial Conference of the Pompidou Group, opening today at the Council of Europe headquarters, during which a new Pompidou Group work programme will be decided for 2011–14. The signatories of the MoU were Secretary-General of the Council of Europe Thorbjørn Jagland and EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. The EMCDDA and the Pompidou Group have worked closely together for over 15 years. The Pompidou Group is a permanent observer on the EMCDDA Management Board, while the EMCDDA participates at the meetings of the Pompidou Group’s Permanent Correspondents. Today’s agreement updates and replaces the first MoU signed between the two bodies in 1999. Under the new agreement, cooperation between the two bodies will be decided on the basis of their respective work programmes, and progress on joint activities will be documented in an annual report. The MoU allows for a regular exchange of information and technical expertise between the two bodies, encouraging the creation of synergies to avoid any duplication of effort. In the area of data collection and analysis, the MoU advocates the promotion, by both parties, of standards and methodologies, as well as the use of measurement methods, tools and instruments such as those developed and documented by the EMCDDA and its Reitox network. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/fs-8_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0467	2010-10-20	UNK	Conference to lay groundwork for monitoring drug markets, crime and supply reduction	 Drug trafficking remains one of the most productive trades for organised criminal groups in the EU today. And understanding how the illicit drug market works is a high priority of the ongoing European strategy and action plan on drugs. In this optic, the European Commission and the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) have joined forces to organise in Brussels this week the First European conference on drug supply indicators. The event is organised with the active involvement of Europol. The organisers believe that this milestone event will make an important contribution to achieving the objectives of the EU drugs action plan (2009–12), which calls for the design of standard European indicators on drug supply issues by 2012 (1). The aim of the conference will be to lay the groundwork for a set of technically sound and sustainable indicators for monitoring drug markets, crime and supply reduction to be completed by this date. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘The last two years have seen unprecedented interest, both technically and politically, in improving the evidence base for understanding issues of drug supply. It is now time to exploit this momentum and put in place the information tools needed to better understand this area of key importance for European drug policy. This is a prerequisite to designing more efficient interventions in future against drug trafficking and drug-related crime.’ Around 120 European and international experts will gather at this by-invitation event to draw up a realistic strategy for moving forward in this area. Among them will be: law-enforcement officers, forensic scientists, criminologists, national data-collection specialists, economists, policy analysts and technical staff of EU and international institutions. ‘European drug policy is based on a balanced approach that deals with the demand as well as the supply of illicit drugs’, says Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea, Director at the European Commission’s DG Justice. ‘This conference comes as a result of major investments by the European Commission in research into drug markets and how to control them. Through consensus-building among the EU Member States, the event will help us improve our capacity to address the pressing issue of drug supply in Europe’. In 2011, technical groups supported by the EMCDDA will take forward the work initiated at the conference.  This will result in a concept paper and roadmap for implementing one indicator in each of the conference's three thematic areas (markets, crime and supply reduction). These documents will ultimately be presented to a second consensus meeting, scheduled to be held in Lisbon in 2011. ‘First European conference on drug supply indicators’ 20–22 October 2010  — BY INVITATION ONLY Résidence Palace, Brussels Full programme available at https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/events/supply-indicators The results of the seminar will also be available on this page.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/9_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0468	2010-10-18	UNK	EMCDDA and CICAD–OAS launch joint handbook on building national drug observatories	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) of the Organisation of American States (OAS) launch in Montevideo today a joint handbook on Building a national drugs observatory. The handbook will be released during the fifth Ibero-American meeting of national drug observatories, being held this week in the Uruguayan capital (18–22 October).  The EMCDDA collaborates with CICAD under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in 2000 (1). Supporting the establishment of national drug observatories and drug information networks is a significant component of this partnership. Since the adoption of the United Nations ‘drug conventions’ (2), countries have been obliged to report regularly on their national drug situations as well as on interventions to address them. International and regional organisations are also setting target-based action plans which rely increasingly on reliable, factual and quality data. National drug observatories play a key role in gathering data of this kind and feeding into the drug policy debate. Over the last two decades, the EMCDDA has created some 30 national drug observatories or ‘national focal points’ across Europe, which form the European information network on drugs and drug addiction (Reitox) (3). CICAD–OAS has assisted its Member States in creating and strengthening similar structures across Latin America. Based on the experience of the two bodies in their respective geographical areas, today’s handbook provides a practical guide relevant for all world regions and adaptable to a wide range of national and institutional settings.  It is complemented by an online toolbox to ensure the continued exchange of experience and best practice. ‘Over the last two decades, national drug observatories have been established on both sides of the Atlantic, and this handbook transcribes the lessons learned in the process’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘On the European side, the handbook furnishes us with an effective training tool to support the future development of observatories beyond EU borders’. The value of the handbook was underlined by Europe’s closest neighbours last week at an EMCDDA–European Commission seminar held in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) (4). ‘The CICAD–OAS Hemispheric Drug Strategy, adopted this year, heralds a new phase in regional cooperation on the drugs problem’, adds James Mack, Executive Secretary of CICAD. ‘In the past, too many public policy decisions on drugs were based on “good intentions”. This strategy gives weight to the national drug observatories that now provide the scientific evidence needed to underpin drug policy. Our experience in creating these structures at the core of our monitoring system is reflected in the handbook’.  This week’s meeting in Montevideo is held in cooperation with the Spanish national plan on drugs and is financed by the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs — through its Agency of International Cooperation (AECID) — and the US State Department. At the event, participating representatives of the Ibero-American drug observatories will work in plenary sessions and workshops on the concepts and methodological tools presented in the handbook. Building a national drugs observatory: a joint handbook The handbook is currently available in Spanish, English and French at https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/joint/ndo-handbook Further language versions are planned for 2010 and 2011 (provisionally Arabic, Croatian, Italian, Russian and Turkish). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/8_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0470	2010-10-11	UNK	EU drugs agency explores cooperation with Europe’s closest neighbours	 Europe’s drug monitoring system will be showcased by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in Brussels this week at a seminar held in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) (1). Perspectives for technical cooperation between the drugs agency and the 16 ENP partner countries (2) will be explored at the event, with a particular focus on institution-building and boosting drug monitoring capacity. The kick-off meeting will conclude with a work plan for the period 2011–13. Organised by the EMCDDA, in cooperation with the European Commission (3), the seminar is financed by the Commission’s Technical Assistance and Information Exchange Instrument (TAIEX) (4). The event will bring together for the first time policymakers from the ENP countries with representatives from the EMCDDA, the European Commission and international organisations working in the field. Presentations on the European monitoring system will be complemented by workshops on the drug monitoring experiences, needs and expectations of the ENP countries. The European Neighbourhood Policy aims to forge closer ties with countries to the South and East of the European Union. Through this policy, the EU seeks to strengthen the prosperity, stability and security of all countries concerned. In March 2007, the Council of the EU agreed on the gradual participation of ENP partner countries in the work of EU agencies to encourage regulatory and administrative reform and to promote convergence of the ENP partners’ policies with EU norms, standards and best practice. In the coming three-year period, closer cooperation is expected between the European information network on drugs and drug addiction (Reitox) and ENP countries, with targeted support offered by the EMCDDA for establishing or strengthening national drug monitoring centres (5). Next week, the EMCDDA and the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD–OAS) will launch a joint handbook on building such structures, which is designed as a practical guide relevant for all world regions.

Gil Kerlikowske, visited the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in Lisbon today for talks with the agency’s Director Wolfgang Götz and principal scientists. The meeting offered a forum for exchanging views on EU and US drug policy developments and for showcasing the latest projects and activities. During the meeting, analysts compared notes on a broad range issues, including: drugged driving; best practice and demand reduction approaches; early-warning systems on new drugs; and the medical use of cannabis.    The development of supply and supply-reduction indicators was prominent on the agenda, ahead of the first European conference on this issue to be held in Brussels in October (1). The status of cooperation between the two bodies was also reviewed. Informal contacts have been ongoing since 1998. Nominated by President Obama, Mr Kerlikowske took up office as ONDCP Director on 7 May 2009. In this role, he coordinates all aspects of federal drug control programmes and is charged with producing and implementing the President's national drug control strategy. The former Seattle police chief brings almost 40 years of law- enforcement and drug policy experience to the position. This is the third visit of a US ‘drug tsar’ to the EMCDDA premises. General Barry McCaffrey attended an informal US–EU Drug Forum organised by the EMCDDA and ONDCP in Lisbon in 1998, and addressed the EMCDDA Management Board the following year (2). During his visit to Portugal, Mr Kerlikowske held meetings with Portuguese Secretary of State for Health Dr Manuel Pizarro, and with Portuguese drug coordinator João Goulão, Director of the Instituto da Droga e da Toxicodependência (IDT). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/fs-7_en

The focus of the visit was the endorsement of a new EMCDDA–CICAD work programme for 2011–13. The EMCDDA collaborates with CICAD under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) it signed in 2000 with CICAD's parent body, the Organisation of American States (OAS)(1). In the context of the MoU, the two bodies held their annual coordination meeting in Washington in June this year to fine-tune the programme signed today. Strategic objectives outlined in the three-year plan include: strengthening regional and international monitoring systems; harmonising and developing indicators in the areas of drug supply and demand; and supporting the establishment of national drug monitoring centres and drug information networks. In line with the programme, the organisations will be releasing next month a joint handbook on building national drug observatories, a significant component of the EMCDDA–CICAD partnership. The upcoming publication is designed to support the establishment and development of national drug monitoring centres in Europe — including non-EU countries — and in Latin America. The handbook will be launched mid-October at events in Brussels and Montevideo (2). Later this week, the EMCDDA and CICAD Directors will attend in Coimbra the EU–LAC City Forum, held under CICAD’s EU–LAC Drug Treatment Partnerships, an initiative funded by the European Commission (3). At the event, participating mayors will ratify, sign and launch a new EU-LAC City Partnership in Drug Demand Reduction, as agreed at the Drug Summit of European, Latin American and Caribbean Mayors and Cities earlier this year (4). The Coimbra City Forum is being organised with the technical support of the Portuguese Institute on Drugs and Drug Addiction (Instituto da Droga e da Toxicodependência/IDT). A key figure at the event will be Chairman of the EMCDDA Management Board João Goulão. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/fs-6_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0473	2010-06-24	UNK	Injecting drug use — stable or declining in most European countries	 Injecting drug use is strongly associated with severe health problems in drug users, including both blood-borne infections (e.g. HIV/AIDS, hepatitis) and overdose. But the latest analysis of this practice is encouraging, says the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). In a new report released today ahead of International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking (26 June), the agency describes how injecting drug use is now stable or declining in most European countries (1). ‘Injecting drug use has a long history in Europe, but came to the fore in the early 1980s in the context of a growing heroin problem and the diffusion of HIV. Since then it has been associated with over 100 000 deaths’, explains Chairman of the EMCDDA Management Board, João Goulão. ‘Some 30 years on, we are encouraged that drug injecting now appears to be waning. But we cannot forget that it is still at the heart of Europe’s drug problem’, he adds. In this latest report, Trends in injecting drug use in Europe, the EMCDDA estimates that there may be between 750 000 and one million active injecting drug users currently in the EU. And, in several countries, there are still signs of recent recruitment into drug injecting.  The report analyses data from a variety of sources to describe Europe’s current drug injection problem and to plot its trends in recent years (2). Also reviewed are responses to drug injecting and measures to reduce the harm it causes. Smaller proportion of those entering treatment now report injecting Data collected on drug users entering treatment provide a comprehensive picture of drug injecting in Europe.        One-third (33 %) of all those entering treatment for drug problems in 26 countries (25 EU + Croatia) report ‘usually injecting’ their main drug of choice. The proportion varies greatly between countries, with ‘usual injectors’ representing under 2 % of all those entering treatment in the Netherlands and 93 % in Lithuania (3). According to today’s report, of the clients entering treatment for the first time for opioid, cocaine or amphetamine problems, the proportion reporting injecting has decreased in most countries. Injecting drug use in Europe is mostly linked to opioid use, but now less than half (45 %) of those entering treatment for primary opioid use report ‘usually injecting’ their drug (see Figure 4, p.12). Between 2002 and 2007, among heroin users entering treatment for the first time, the decline in the proportion of injectors was statistically significant in 10 countries. Only two countries, Bulgaria and Slovakia, bucked the trend with statistically significant increases. Over the same five-year period, data on those entering treatment for the first time suggest a declining trend in injecting among primary cocaine users and a stable trend among primary amphetamine users (4). Among primary opioid users entering treatment, the lowest proportion of current injectors is reported by Denmark   (2 %), with Belgium, Spain, France and the Netherlands also reporting levels below 25 %. The highest levels of injecting among this group are reported from countries that entered the EU in 2004 or later: 97 % in Lithuania and over 90 % in Latvia and Romania. Studies of drug users in non-treatment settings (e.g. cohort studies) largely confirm the overall decline in injecting among opioid users in Europe. But still signs of recent recruitment into drug injecting The proportion of new (less than two years) and young (under 25) drug users within samples of injecting drug users is used as an indicator of recent initiation to injecting. The report finds that new injectors make up less than 10 % of injectors sampled in 10 EU Member States in the context of infectious disease surveillance. Although in two EU Member States (Czech Republic, Lithuania) and Turkey their proportions are higher (above 20 %), suggesting ongoing new recruitment to injecting here in recent years (see Figure 5, p.14). Injectors under the age of 25 account for less than 20 % of injectors sampled in 11 countries (10 EU + Turkey), but for over 40 % of injectors sampled in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Romania and Slovakia. Most of the countries reporting higher proportions of young injectors experienced the introduction of heroin use later than elsewhere in Europe. This underlines a need for continued vigilance in these countries to reduce the potential for any future epidemic spread of HIV in these groups of injectors. HIV infection is one of the most serious health consequences of injecting drug use and one that poses a threat, not only to the drug users themselves, but also to their sexual partners and the general population. According to today’s report, in the EU Member States, the rates of newly diagnosed cases of HIV infection among injecting drug users are mostly at stable and low levels, or in decline (5), consistent with the general trend in injecting drug use. In comparison, among countries neighbouring the EU, increasing rates of reported HIV cases attributed to injecting drug use suggest high levels of drug injecting and ongoing HIV transmission. More services for drug injectors, although coverage still uneven European countries target injecting drug use and its consequences through a variety of interventions, mainly in the fields of drug treatment and harm reduction. The most prominent of these is opioid substitution treatment (OST), which is now available in all 27 EU Member States, Croatia and Norway. According to latest estimates, there are around 650 000 clients in substitution treatment in the EU, representing more than a three-fold increase since 1995. The level of provision, however, is not uniform across countries, with available estimates showing considerable variation. Data from 10 countries show variations in the proportion of problem opioid users with access to OST: from 5 % in Cyprus to over 50 % in Germany. Providing drug users with access to sterile injecting equipment is an important measure to reduce the harms associated with drug injecting, such as the spread of infectious diseases. Needle and syringe exchange programmes now exist in all 27 EU Member States, Croatia and Norway. Specialised syringe provision outlets — not including pharmacy sales — are estimated to distribute on average about 50 syringes a year per injecting drug user across the EU. In prisons, drug injecting is associated with high levels of syringe sharing, but only five EU countries have implemented syringe exchange programmes in this setting. ‘Injecting drug use was one of the major problems in Europe that motivated policymakers to create the EMCDDA in the early 1990s’, recalls EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘The data we publish today show that injecting drug use is declining in many countries, as are rates of new HIV infections among drug users. These developments can been linked to sound investments made in effective prevention, treatment and harm-reduction measures which now reach many more of those in need. Nonetheless we cannot ignore the fact that many drug users still inject their drugs and that this form of behaviour can be particularly damaging. Targeting drug injection and the harms it causes therefore remains a high priority for European drug policy’.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/5_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0474	2010-06-24	UNK	Twenty-five years’ experience in the cross-border collection and analysis of information	 Wolfgang Götz has been Director of the EMCDDA since May 2005, having been appointed by the agency’s Management Board on 19 April that year. In July 2009, the Board renewed his mandate unanimously for a further five-year term commencing on 1 May 2010. During his first mandate, Mr Götz paid special attention to ‘enhancing the scientific quality and efficiency of the agency’s work’ and to providing policymakers with evidence-based information for ‘a more informed and reasoned debate on the drugs problem’. On taking up the position, he declared: ‘Our job is not to dictate drug policy but to provide the evidence necessary for informed decision-making. Sound information is the key to an effective strategy on drugs.’ The beginning of his second mandate coincided with the adoption of an ambitious EMCDDA three-year work programme for 2010–12, and the agency’s move to new premises in the Portuguese capital. Commenting on his reappointment, he vowed a ‘renewed energy’ to pursue the goals set out in this programme and a ‘strong commitment’ to boosting the agency’s scientific performance and independence.   Mr Götz has proven expertise in the building, and effective use, of statistical and information systems and has extensive experience in managing a multilingual, multinational staff. As Director, his main priorities are to set clear strategic priorities for the agency, enhance the quality and efficiency of its work, and boost its reputation as the European reference point on drugs. Among the challenges for the future, Mr Götz cites keeping pace with change and providing policymakers with an up-to-date understanding of the issues they face (e.g. via the effective monitoring of new substances and patterns of use). He also underlines the need to further develop demand reduction and supply reduction activities, notably in improving information tools and analysis. A German civil servant, fluent in English and French, Mr Götz has been seconded to international organisations since 1985. He has a Master’s degree in Economics from the University of Freiburg, and has lectured in macroeconomics, management and accounting. He has spent most of his 33-year career managing international projects and teams in the area of collecting, analysing and managing statistics and other information key to policy-making and implementation. Mr Götz was born in Freiburg on 17 November 1951. Career highlights: •    1 May 2010 — starts second five-year term as Director of the EMCDDA. •    19 April 2005 — appointed Director of the EMCDDA (first five-year term). •    February 2001 — appointed Head of unit responsible for the European Information Network on        Drugs and Drug Addiction (Reitox), composed of national drug monitoring centres across Europe.       Key responsibilities during this period include preparations for the integration of 10 new EU Member States (2004 EU enlargement). •    December 1996 — joins the EMCDDA to head its Information department. Develops strategies in the areas of multilingual publishing, media and public relations and information technology. •    1994 — moves to Eurostat (EU statistics agency) in Luxembourg to focus on the statistical practices and requirements of Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs). Conceives and oversees measures to strengthen and standardise their statistical systems and sets up the first systematic dataflow from the CEECs to Eurostat. •    1985 — embarks on the international phase of his career. Heads an EU project in Togo managing statistical field surveys and the analysis and dissemination of results. Heads a regional project supporting West African nations in the standardisation of the foreign trade and customs statistics and procedures. At the same time, he supervises the development of the central information system holding data from the members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/fs-5_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0475	2010-06-10	UNK	EU drugs and medicines agencies sign agreement today in London	 Exchanging information on new psychoactive substances and misused medicines is facilitated today, thanks to a new working arrangement signed in London this afternoon by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) (1). The signatories were EMA Executive Director, Thomas Lönngren and EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. The two EU agencies have worked closely together since 1997 when they began exchanging information on, and assessing the risks of, new synthetic drugs in Europe (2). Since 2005, they have cooperated in implementing the three-step legal instrument through which Europe now monitors and acts on new psychoactive substances (3). Where relevant, the bodies exchange data from the EU early-warning system on new psychoactive substances and the EU pharmacovigilance system, which monitors the safety of medicines (4). The new working arrangement furthers cooperation and boosts information exchange between the agencies.  The EMCDDA reports on an ad hoc basis to the EMA on any misuse of medicinal products detected through its networks (complementing information gathered through the EU pharmacovigilance system). The new arrangement opens doors for the EMA to provide ad hoc reports to the EMCDDA on the misuse of authorised medicinal products.  In addition to increased reporting, the document allows for greater exchange of expertise between the two agencies (e.g. via consultations, projects and meetings), while ensuring the optimal use of resources. The document also states that any conflict of scientific opinion relating to the risk assessment of a given substance should ‘be resolved at an early stage’. Among the new features of the arrangement is the possibility for the EMA to consult the EMCDDA when defining risk management plans for selected medicinal products. The EMCDDA and the EMA are currently collaborating in an ongoing European investigation into the health and social risks of the new psychoactive substance, mephedrone. The EMA will take part in the risk assessment of the drug on 15 July, under the auspices of the EMCDDA Scientific Committee (5). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/fs-4_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0476	2010-05-28	UNK	Children’s voices — experiences and perceptions of children around drugs and alcohol	 A collection of narratives from children on issues of substance use in Europe is released by the EMCDDA today ahead of International Children’s Day (1 June). Alcohol and drug use in their different forms can have a profound impact on the lives of children. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states that children should be able to express their views in all matters touching their lives. The purpose of today’s paper — Children’s voices — is to provide a channel for such expression and offer meaning and insight into some of the key drug and alcohol issues affecting children. Around 60 000 children in Europe today are likely to be living with individuals who are receiving treatment for drug problems. And many more are living with a drug-using parent or others not in contact with treatment services.  Epidemiological studies routinely collect quantitative data on alcohol and drug use among adults and children,  but far less is published on the qualitative aspects of substance use problems. In this optic, today’s review presents quotations gleaned from interviews with children in 14 European countries. Through these testimonies, the report illustrates how qualitative research can provide glimpses into the experiences, perceptions and vulnerability of children facing drug issues that statistics alone cannot provide. It is widely recognised that drug policies and interventions for children are enhanced when children’s perspectives are acknowledged and their needs addressed. The quotations, selected from grey literature (e.g. research studies, governmental and non-governmental reports) give voice to four main issues for children: •    living with harmful parental drinking or drug taking (neglect, violence, abuse, stigma, shame); •    being separated from parents and looked after by relatives, foster carers or institutions; •    experience and perceptions about alcohol and drug consumption; and •    experience and perceptions about interventions to address alcohol and drug consumption. Some of the quotations highlighted today are invocations by children for better and more tailored care and for appropriate family support at the right time. Others are simply calls for their views to be heard and their experiences acknowledged. The testimonies gathered do not claim to represent the situation of all children affected by drugs and alcohol in Europe. They do, however, illustrate an overarching theme: the vulnerability of children from families with substance use problems and the need for interventions that are sensitive and adapted to individual circumstances. According to the EMCDDA, qualitative research focuses on the meanings, perceptions, processes and context of substance use problems and offers a way to understand and plan responses. As one youth worker puts it:      ‘You need to be able to step into their world and understand what their world is like for them. If workers can’t do that, they can have all the drugs and alcohol knowledge, but they’re not going to be very successful working with that young person’.                                                                                                                                                                                      	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/fs-3_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0477	2010-05-27	UNK	Council calls on EU scientific experts to assess risks of mephedrone	 Europe has responded to rising concern over the use of the synthetic drug mephedrone by formally requesting a scientific investigation into the health and social risks of the substance. The decision was communicated to the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) by the Council of the EU today, in line with a legal procedure designed to respond to potentially threatening new psychoactive drugs in the EU (1). The risk-assessment exercise, which will result in a report by end-July, will be undertaken by the EMCDDA Scientific Committee, with the participation of additional experts from the EU Member States, European Commission, Europol and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The exercise constitutes the second phase in the three-step legal procedure: (i) information exchange/early-warning; (ii) risk assessment; and (iii) decision-making/control. Today’s decision is based on the findings of a ‘Europol–EMCDDA joint report on a new psychoactive substance: 4-methylmethcathinone (mephedrone)’, submitted in late March to the Council of the EU, the European Commission and the EMA, concluding Step I of the process (2). Released today on the EMCDDA website, the report features: the chemical and physical description of the drug; evidence of intoxications and fatalities; data on seizures; and information on international trafficking and the involvement of organised crime. In its conclusions, the report presents a case for a formal risk assessment of the substance (Step II). Commenting today, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘A decision to place a new substance under control should not be taken lightly. I believe that Europe sets a good example with its fast-track mechanism for scientifically assessing the health and social risks of new drugs and investigating links to organised crime. Our decision-making process must be informed by a rational assessment of the available evidence rather than by anecdotal and possibly inaccurate reports’. Mephedrone is a central nervous system stimulant belonging to the group of synthetic cathinone derivatives, which includes substances such as methylone, methedrone and flephedrone (3). Towards the end of 2009, increased evidence of mephedrone use and availability prompted the agencies on 20 January 2010 to embark on a formal data-collection exercise, resulting in their joint report on the substance (4). Over the last two years, mephedrone and mephedrone-containing products have been aggressively marketed by online suppliers as a legal alternative to ecstasy, amphetamines or cocaine. Advertised online as a ‘research chemical’, 'bath salts', ‘plant food’ and even ‘hoover freshener’, the drug is commonly known by names such as: meph, drone, miaow miaow, bubbles, bounce and subcoca. In some EU Member States, users may source mephedrone from specialised shops (head/smart shops) or street-level drug dealers. The substance is often labelled 'not for human consumption', in order to circumvent potential controls. On the basis of the risk assessment report (and at the initiative of the European Commission or a Member State), the Council may decide to subject the drug to control measures throughout the EU (Step III) (5). In such a case, EU Member States would then be required to introduce such controls in line with national laws no later than one year after the Council’s decision. ‘The strength of the European early-warning system lies in the fact that, if a decision is taken to control a new drug, this will become a common position throughout the EU’, explains Wolfgang Götz. ‘New drugs marketed and sold online exploit Europe’s open consumer market and are a real test for our existing drug control structures. This poses a collective challenge for EU Member States and one which, I firmly believe, can only be addressed effectively with a collective response’.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/4_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0478	2010-04-29	UNK	Latest analysis of cocaine market highlights ‘secondary extraction’ laboratories in Europe	 Increasingly sophisticated techniques to conceal and smuggle cocaine into Europe are reviewed in a new EMCDDA–Europol market analysis — Cocaine: A European Union perspective in the global context (1). Published today, the review provides insight into how cocaine is produced and trafficked into the EU, the people involved, routes taken, and the scale of the problem in Europe. Also analysed are some of the supply reduction initiatives already developed at European level (2). One innovative technique identified in the report involves incorporating cocaine base or hydrochloride (HCI) into other materials (e.g. beeswax, plastic, clothing), then extracting it in special laboratories set up inside EU borders. Around 40 of these cocaine so-called ‘secondary extraction’ laboratories were seized in the EU in 2008, says the report, an issue of increasing concern to the two EU agencies. These differ from laboratories found in South America which manufacture cocaine base or HCI from coca leaves or coca paste (3). Europe has become an important destination for cocaine manufactured in South America. In 2007, an estimated 73 800 seizures in EU Member States, Croatia, Turkey and Norway resulted in the interception of almost 77 tonnes of cocaine. With these figures, Europe ranked third in the world for the amount of cocaine confiscated, after South and North America. With a significant proportion of the global cocaine output now destined for Europe, new cross-Atlantic trafficking routes have emerged. The report describes the three main Europe-bound cocaine smuggling routes (Northern, Central, West African). It also shows how law enforcement data point to shifting landing points within Europe’s main gateway regions — the Iberian Peninsula and the Low Countries (Belgium and the Netherlands) — as well as to the spread of trafficking networks eastwards. According to the report, this increases the risk of cocaine use diffusing into central and eastern European countries which, to date, have been comparatively little affected (see also EMCDDA 2009 Annual report: the state of the drugs problem in Europe). Commenting on the report, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘Cocaine use and cocaine-related problems have increased markedly in Europe since the mid-1990s and around three million young adults report to have used the drug in the last year. I am particularly concerned by our latest analysis which illustrates the growing sophistication and innovation of cocaine traffickers in circumventing the law and the potential for the supply-led diffusion of cocaine into central and eastern European countries’. In 2007, worldwide seizures of illicit shipments of potassium permanganate — the chemical precursor used in the manufacture of cocaine — reached a total of 153 tonnes (101 tonnes in 2006). Colombia accounted for 94 % of the 2007 seizures (144 tonnes). The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) monitors the international trade in (and diversion of) this chemical, with South America being subject to special scrutiny. With close examination at home, illicit potassium permanganate importers from South America may now be using Africa as a transit territory, says the report. It is also likely that countries in West Africa are being used to carry out the final stages of the cocaine manufacturing process. Europol Director Rob Wainwright said: ‘At Europol we are working closely with law enforcement agencies in the EU Member States, providing on-the-spot assistance to investigations, dismantling cocaine laboratories and supporting operational analysis. Through our Project Cola, we help countries prevent or combat criminality by collecting intelligence on suspected criminal organisations involved in the production, processing or trafficking of cocaine. In so doing, we keep law enforcement agencies in the EU up-to-date on new methods of cocaine smuggling and heighten awareness of global drug trafficking trends.’ Most of the cocaine available in the world today is produced from coca grown in Colombia, where the plant contributes significantly to the local economy. Various measures to prevent coca cultivation and offer alternative livelihoods to the growers have been developed and supported by the EU and its Member States. However, the concentration of land ownership plus the ongoing armed conflict make effective and long-term action difficult. While underlining the need to boost cocaine interception efforts, the report also presents arguments for complementary initiatives to address the underlying causes that encourage cocaine production and trafficking. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/3_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0479	2010-04-23	UNK	Record number of new drugs reported in 2009, says report	 A record number of new drugs were officially reported in 2009 to the EMCDDA and Europol via the EU early-warning system (EWS) on new psychoactive substances. This is according to the EMCDDA–Europol 2009 annual report on the implementation of the three-step legal instrument through which Europe monitors and acts on new substances (1). According to the report, released today, 24 new psychoactive substances were officially notified for the first time to the two agencies in 2009. This represents the largest number of substances ever reported in a single year and almost double the number notified in 2008 (13). All of the new compounds were synthetic, including two substances with medicinal properties. A full list of the substances notified is annexed to the report. Highlighted as significant new developments in 2009 were the emergence of new, smokable herbal products laced with synthetic cannabinoids (the so-called ‘Spice’ phenomenon) and the growing popularity of synthetic cathinones. A total of nine synthetic cannabinoids, from four distinct chemical groups, were reported via the EWS in 2009, as well as four synthetic cathinones. The latter are derivatives of the parent compound cathinone, which is structurally related to amphetamine. Towards the end of 2009, increased evidence of the use and availability of one synthetic cathinone, mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone), prompted the EMCDDA and Europol to embark on a formal data-collection exercise on the substance (Step I of the legal process). This led to a joint report on mephedrone, submitted to the EU institutions and the European Medicines Agency in March, paving the way for a possible risk assessment on the drug (Step II) (2). The appearance of a large number of new unregulated synthetic compounds, marketed on the Internet as ‘legal highs’ or ‘not for human consumption’, states the report, presents a growing challenge for monitoring, responding to, and controlling the use of new psychoactive substances. The piperazine mCPP, extensively covered in previous years, is also given attention in this year’s report. Data from various sources highlight a marked increase of the percentage of ‘ecstasy’ tablets containing this substance, while the availability of MDMA on the market appears to be decreasing. It is noteworthy that no new piperazines or psychoactive plants were reported in 2009. The report concludes that the EWS has high reporting capabilities and the capacity to triangulate information from different sources. Over 110 substances have been reported by Member States to the EMCDDA and Europol since the EWS was created in 1997. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/2_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0480	2010-04-21	UNK	EU drugs agency publishes major work on harm reduction: past, present and future	 Harm reduction is now an integral part of contemporary drug policies and plays an important role in responding to drug use in Europe. But this has not always been the case, say the experts. In a major new scientific work on the subject published today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), leading European and international specialists chart how harm reduction shifted from controversy to mainstream. In this latest EMCDDA monograph — Harm reduction: evidence, impacts and challenges — over 50 authors examine two decades of harm reduction research and practice in Europe and beyond (1). They also wrestle with how the concept may broaden and evolve as patterns of drug use change. ‘Harm reduction is generally used as an umbrella term to cover interventions, programmes and policies that seek to reduce the health, social and economic harms of drug use to individuals, communities and societies’, says the agency. While its underlying principles can be traced back to the early 1900s, it became prominent in the 1980s in response to HIV epidemics among injecting drug users and the threat this posed to public health. On account of its primary goal to reduce risk, harm reduction soon sparked controversy, particularly among those promoting more traditional, abstinence-oriented care. Despite this, today it stands alongside prevention, treatment, social rehabilitation and supply reduction as part of the ‘comprehensive approach’ to drug policy, endorsed by the European Union (2). ‘Since the mid-1980s, harm reduction has transformed from a peer-driven, grassroots approach to an accepted part of the European drug policy landscape’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘European countries were among the earlier adopters of harm reduction and are now among the forerunners of innovations in harm reduction practice and technology. The EU drug strategies and action plans have been a strong influence in consolidating harm reduction in many countries as an important element of drug policy’. Harm reduction is often referred to as a ‘combination intervention’, offered as a pragmatic package of responses adapted to local need and setting. Of these, the best known are needle and syringe exchange programmes (NSPs) and opioid substitution treatment (OST). By 2009, all 27 EU Member States supported harm reduction in policy or practice, all providing NSPs and OST. But although the general European trend is one of growth and consolidation of harm reduction measures, says the EMCDDA, a closer look at the current situation reveals a more qualified picture. ‘EU Member States do employ a combination of some of the main harm reduction measures…but considerable differences exist in the range and levels of service provision’. Evidence, impacts and challenges •    Part I of the monograph — ‘Background’ — looks back at the emergence of harm reduction approaches and their diffusion as part of the new public health movement of the mid-1980s. It explores the concept from several perspectives (e.g. international organisations, academic researchers and drug users). •    Part II of the monograph — ‘Evidence and impacts’ — illustrates how harm reduction has broadened to cover a wide range of behaviours and harms, including those related to alcohol, tobacco and recreational drug use. It provides a state-of-the-art reflection on the development of harm reduction services in Europe and considers what is known about their effectiveness. •    ‘Challenges and innovations’ of harm reduction are addressed in Part III. This explores the role of the still contentious drug consumption rooms; the involvement of drug users in developing the services that affect their lives; responses to young people’s recreational drug use; criminal justice approaches to harm reduction and the implications of varied problem drug use patterns in Europe today. ‘Over the last 20 years, harm reduction has changed the way we think about and respond to drug problems in Europe, and has been influential in addressing the risks posed by drug injecting’, says Dr Michael Farrell, Chairman of the EMCDDA Scientific Committee. ‘Its development into a mainstream concept in Europe illustrates how, over time, evidence-based argument can lead to the adoption of policy options initially viewed as controversial. With this monograph, the EMCDDA provides us with an authoritative reference work on harm reduction research and practice in Europe. Charting how a concept once synonymous with opioid use came to cover a broader range of harms, the publication offers a timely and valuable contribution to the ongoing debate on how to respond to today’s more diverse drug problems’. The EMCDDA would like to thank all authors, editors and reviewers who worked on this publication. In particular, the monograph benefited from overall editorial input of Tim Rhodes and Dagmar Hedrich. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/1_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0481	2010-03-25	UNK	EMCDDA and Europol Directors review new substances entering Europe’s illicit drug market 	 Monitoring new substances entering Europe’s illicit drug market was the focus of talks today between the Directors of the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the European law enforcement agency (Europol). The two EU agencies collaborate actively in detecting and monitoring new and potentially threatening psychoactive substances entering the European market and in assessing the involvement of organised crime in their manufacture and trafficking. Meeting at the EMCDDA in Lisbon this afternoon, Wolfgang Götz (EMCDDA) and Rob Wainwright (Europol) endorsed two joint reports providing the latest update on new substances in Europe. The first of these is the EMCDDA–Europol annual report on the implementation of the ‘Council Decision on the information exchange, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances’, the three-step legal mechanism through which Europe monitors new substances (1). This report presents the key findings of how the mechanism was implemented in 2009, detailing the appearance over the 12 months of new unregulated synthetic compounds openly marketed as ‘legal highs’ and specifically designed to circumvent drug controls. Also listed are the psychoactive substances officially notified in 2009 to the EMCDDA and Europol via the early-warning system. The second report focuses on the new drug mephedrone and results from recent information collection on the substance by the two EU agencies and their respective networks in the EU Member States. This report completes Step I of the monitoring process established by the Council Decision (early-warning and information exchange). On the basis of this report, a decision may be taken by the Council of the EU whether or not to launch a formal risk-assessment procedure on the substance (Step II). Both reports will be formally submitted this week to the European institutions and the Member States before being released to the public in the coming weeks. Also discussed at today’s meeting were matters of strategic cooperation. The two EU agencies stepped up their cooperation on drugs and crime in March 2009 approving a series of collaborative activities for the period 2009–12. This action was taken in the framework of a ‘Cooperation Agreement’ signed by the organisations in Brussels on 19 November 2001 (2).  Among these activities is an EMCDDA–Europol joint publication series covering key aspects of European drug markets. The second title in this series Cocaine: A European Union perspective in the global context is due for release next month (www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications).   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/fs-2_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0482	2010-01-28	UNK	EU drugs agency signs accord with Ukrainian Ministry of Health	 The European Union and Ukraine will share information on drugs more systematically in future, thanks to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in Kiev today between the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the Ukrainian Ministry of Health. The signatories were the Ukrainian Minister of Health Vasyl Mykhailovych Knyazevich and EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. The Head of the EU’s Delegation to Ukraine, Ambassador José Manuel Pinto Teixeira, also took part in the signing ceremony. The accord is the fruit of bilateral talks initiated in Lisbon in 2006 between the EU drugs agency and the  Ukrainian authorities, and follows a series of working meetings and diplomatic visits. The EMCDDA Management Board adopted the MoU at its meeting in Lisbon in December 2009 on the eve of that year’s   EU–Ukraine Summit (4 December, Kiev). The Ukrainian Medical and Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Alcohol (UMMCDA) of the Ministry of Health has been appointed the national centre to collect and analyse data on the Ukrainian drug and alcohol situation.   The new agreement establishes cooperation between the EMCDDA and the Ukrainian competent bodies (particularly the UMMCDA) in the collection, processing and dissemination of drug information. The MoU, signed for an initial period of five years, will help the parties develop joint methods of monitoring illicit drug use. It also allows for a regular exchange of information on new drug types and psychotropic substances appearing on the illicit drug market, as well as the technologies used in their production. Under the agreement, the EMCDDA will facilitate training and the exchange of experts and scientific research results (e.g. related to illicit drug trafficking, monitoring the drug situation and other issues of mutual interest). Ukraine is a priority partner country within the European Neighbourhood Policy and is a member of the Eastern Partnership. Since the EU enlargement of May 2004, the EU and Ukraine have shared a common border and, as direct neighbours, face common challenges. Among these are the fight against illegal cross-border activities, including organised crime, terrorism and drug trafficking. Ukrainian seaports, roads and railways continue to be used by criminal groups, as part of the ‘Northern route’, to smuggle drugs from Afghanistan into Western Europe. Commenting on the MoU, Wolfgang Götz said: ‘Today’s accord lays the foundation for a new working relationship between the EMCDDA and its Ukrainian counterparts and is an important step towards building an evidence base on the Ukrainian drug situation in the European context. In turn, this will present us with a more complete overview of Europe's drug phenomenon and facilitate sound policymaking in the field. We look forward with enthusiasm to working with our Ukrainian partners on the broad range of issues which characterise our drug problems today’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2010/fs1-emcdda-agreement-with-Ukraine_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0483	2009-12-03	UNK	Board elects Portuguese member João Goulão as new EMCDDA Chairman	 The EU drugs agency’s Management Board convened for a two-day meeting in Lisbon today, kicking off with elections for Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Board. João Goulão, Portuguese national drug coordinator and Head of the Institute for Drugs and Drug Addiction — the national focal point in the EMCDDA’s Reitox network — was elected Chairman for the next three years. Dr Goulão has been member of the EMCDDA Board since 2005 and previously served on the agency’s Scientific Committee (1997–2002). A medical doctor by profession, Dr Goulão has over 20 years’ experience in preventing and treating drug addiction in Portugal, having steered a variety of national bodies in these fields. He was also a member of the Portuguese commission which proposed the current national drug strategy.  Dr Goulão takes over the position from Marcel Reimen (Luxembourg) whose mandate ends on 31 December this year. A founding member of the Management Board since 1994, Mr Reimen served as Vice-Chairman (1998–2002), before being elected Chairman for a three-year mandate (2004–06) on 2 July 2003. The departing Chairman was re-elected for a second term on 13 December 2006. During his first mandate (2004–06), Mr Reimen steered the agency through its enlargement to 10 new EU Member States in May 2004. His second mandate (2006–09) coincided with another EU enlargement (2007) and the recast of the EMCDDA regulation, which entered into force in January that year. This granted the agency a more active role in monitoring new drug use patterns and emerging trends. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz paid tribute to Mr Reimen for his ‘extraordinary contribution to the development of the agency since its very first steps’. Claude Gillard (Belgium), another founding member of the agency, was elected to the position of Vice-Chairman today. Mr Gillard has chaired the EMCDDA Budget Committee since 2003 and has greatly facilitated the Board’s decisions on budgetary and financial matters. At today’s meeting, the Board gave its final seal of approval on the agency’s 2010 budget and work programme. On the eve of the EU–Ukraine Summit (4 December, Kiev), the Board also adopted a Memorandum of Understanding, formalising cooperation between the EMCDDA and the Ukraine. This will be signed in the coming weeks. The Management Board is the EMCDDA’s main decision-making body. The Board consists of one representative from each EU Member State and Norway, two European Commission representatives and two independent experts in the drugs field designated by the European Parliament.

EMCDDA_UNK_0484	2009-11-27	UNK	Role of Community agencies in EU enlargement process reinforced	 With the Lisbon Treaty entering into force on 1 December, the issue of EU institutional reform now moves to the sidelines, offering the chance for EU enlargement to move to centre stage. This was among the opening declarations at the conference ‘Community agencies: partners in accession’, hosted this week by the Lisbon-based EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in Sintra. Organised at the initiative of the European Commission, the event brought together some 150 participants from the EU Member States as well as candidate and potential candidate countries to the EU (1). In the context of EU enlargement, the conference set out to nurture partnerships between the European Community agencies and countries participating in the Commission’s Instrument of Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) programme. It is through the IPA programme that would-be EU members receive funding and support to prepare for accession. High-level representatives of the European Commission included Zoltán Kazatsay, Deputy Director-General at the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport, who explained the role of the Community agencies within the EU institutional framework. He referred to the ongoing dialogue between the Commission, Parliament and Council on the way forward for the agencies (2). Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea, Director for Fundamental Rights and Citizenship at the Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security explored the challenges and perspectives of EU governance and enlargement. Yngve Engstroem, Head of unit for regional programmes at the Directorate-General for Enlargement presented mid-term perspectives for cooperation. Working together for the benefit of EU citizens From Stockholm to Cologne and from Lisbon to Dublin, the EU agencies provide service, information and know-how to the EU Member States and their citizens. They are involved in many and varied activities, from improving the environment and protecting health to contributing to food safety and supporting education and training. Since 1997, the Community agencies have been working with candidate countries on technical assistance projects in such fields, in preparation for EU membership. And since 2003, possibilities for collaboration have been extended to the Western Balkans (3). ‘Once countries join the EU, they are automatically required to participate in the work of the agencies’, explains EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘This is why aspiring EU members are encouraged to play an active role in the work of the agencies before entering the Union to ensure that they are fully operational in the specific field at the moment of accession. Partnerships between agencies and the candidate and potential candidate countries to the EU, such as those discussed at this conference, are vital for institution-building and the transfer of know-how and for nurturing valuable and durable relationships based on understanding and trust’. Mr Götz illustrated how partnership projects between the EMCDDA and candidate countries had facilitated the development of national drug monitoring systems and centres in countries joining the Union in 2004 and 2007.  This has resulted in a European drug monitoring system today encompassing all 27 EU Member States and Norway, as well as candidate countries Croatia and Turkey. Closing today in Sintra, the conference described how countries can become members of the Community agencies and debated how technical assistance projects can be further enhanced. Speakers from Poland, Turkey and Bosnia-Herzegovina presented the experiences of a former, current and potential EU candidate country in cooperating with the agencies. The Turkish delegate explained how the country’s Ministry of Health had increased its level of preparedness regarding influenza, following its cooperation with the Stockholm-based EU agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Four working groups focused on the themes of: transport; health; environment and agriculture; and living and working conditions. These reflected on lessons learned from technical assistance projects to date (e.g. key elements of success, how problems were resolved) and future prospects (e.g. new technical assistance projects, expectations, making cooperation more fruitful and efficient). Countries aspiring to EU membership must not only ‘talk the talk’, but must also ‘walk the walk’, putting theory into practice, said David Phinnemore of Queen’s University, Belfast. He stressed that cooperation and partnership were vitally important to increase knowledge and know-how, boost trust and reputation and build contacts. Referring to EU membership as a mere ‘moment’ in the process of EU integration, he stressed that long-lasting partnerships were crucial to ensuring a continually successful EU integration process. Conference recommendations Community agencies should: strengthen the management, design and implementation of projects via more realistic needs’ assessment and the planning of activities with the countries; ensure that projects are more flexible in adapting to the changing reality of countries; ensure that cooperation with the countries is more visible and that information is disseminated at national level on the EU agenda and activities; continue to integrate and associate national experts in relevant working groups and technical meetings so as to facilitate the ‘learning by doing’ process.    Candidate and potential candidate countries should: have one national policy, strategy and structure at sectorial level to support and monitor cooperation with the Community agencies; strengthen the coordination of stakeholders at national level and further support the role of the IPA national coordinating body, so as to guarantee the political responsibility for cooperation. establish consolidated management structures, at least at Ministerial level, so that they can fully benefit from technical assistance and ensure that the national counterparts have the required mandate and level of competence. European Commission should: strengthen the coordination mechanisms and the communication flow between the different EU services and institutions, in order to ensure that activities complement each other and are supported by all EU bodies; integrate in its medium- and long-term perspectives the need for the countries to have more time and resources to fully benefit from their participation in Community agencies; maintain a realistic approach in its contracting procedures and its expectations towards the Community agencies so as to ensure that the technical assistance projects can really meet the needs of the partner countries.

EMCDDA_UNK_0485	2009-11-20	UNK	‘Community agencies: partners in accession’	 ‘Community agencies: partners in accession’ will be the focus of a conference hosted by the Lisbon-based EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in Sintra from 25–27 November, at the initiative of the European Commission (1). The event is financed by the Commission’s Instrument of Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) programme, through which candidate and potential candidate countries to the EU receive funding to prepare for membership. Reinforcing the institutional and administrative capacity of IPA beneficiary countries (2) is a key requirement for enlargement if they are to be in a position to fully adopt, implement and comply with EU standards. Since 1997, the Community agencies have been involved in this process (3), working with candidate countries on a variety of technical assistance projects in areas ranging from health and food safety, to social inclusion and education, to the environment. Since 2003, possibilities for collaboration have been extended to the Western Balkans (4). The Sintra conference will focus on cooperation between the Community agencies and the IPA beneficiary countries in the context of EU enlargement and the long-term construction of the Union. It will bring together around 100 delegates, including policymakers from candidate and potential candidate countries and EU Member States as well as representatives of the agencies and EU institutions. Announcing the event EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz, said: ‘Significant political developments in European history have been commemorated in 2009, notably the 20th anniversary of the fall of the iron curtain and the fifth anniversary of the extensive wave of European Union enlargement in 2004. Looking to the future, this year has also marked the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty by all EU Member States. Clearly Europe is a different place today than it was 20, or even 10, years ago and, as a result, the EU faces new challenges’. ‘As the nature, objectives and modalities of technical cooperation with the candidate and potential candidate countries become more complex, we require a new approach’, he added. ‘We hope that the conclusions of this conference will help improve the design, implementation and added value of technical cooperation projects to the benefit of all partners involved’.   The conference will provide a forum for partner countries to propose how technical assistance projects can be further enhanced. Working groups focusing on the themes of transport, health, environment and agriculture and living and working conditions will reflect on future needs for technical cooperation. The event will also offer the chance to explain the mechanisms and procedures for countries to become members of the agencies and illustrate the added value of joint projects. An exhibition will be organised during the conference showcasing a selection of technical assistance projects already carried out between the Community agencies and IPA beneficiary countries.

EMCDDA_UNK_0486	2009-11-05	UNK	Annual report 2009: highlights	 There is little to suggest any improvement regarding cocaine and heroin use in Europe, the two substances that remain at the heart of Europe’s drugs problem, says the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). Polydrug use is also a major concern, as the range of available substances grows and drug-taking repertoires become increasingly complex (1). But on a more positive note, new data confirm a continued fall in cannabis use, particularly among young people. These comments come today as the agency launches its Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe in Brussels. Cocaine, still Europe’s most popular stimulant — some new rises reported Some 13 million European adults (15–64 years) have tried cocaine in their lifetime. Of these, 7.5 million are young adults (15–34 years), 3 million of whom have used it in the last year. Cocaine use in the EU remains concentrated in western EU countries, but elsewhere in Europe consumption remains low. In highest-prevalence countries Denmark, Spain, Ireland, Italy and the UK, recent surveys show that use in the last year among young adults ranged from 3.1 % to 5.5 % (Chapter 5, Table 8). In most reporting countries, recent data point to a stable or rising trend in last-year use in the 15–34 age group (Figure GPS 14, parts i and ii). In 2007, the number of cocaine seizures in Europe increased to 92 000 (compared with 84 000 in 2006), although the total quantity recovered dropped to 77 tonnes (down from 121 tonnes in 2006). Among those entering drug treatment services for the first time, 22 % cited cocaine as their primary problem drug. Some 500 deaths associated with cocaine use were reported in 2007. Heroin — trend no longer declining Data published today support the EMCDDA’s assessment in last year’s Annual report of a ‘stable but no longer diminishing heroin problem’. Following a decline in heroin-related problems from the mid-1990s to early 2000s, indicators of opioid trends (new demands for treatment, deaths, seizures) still point to worrying developments. ‘While there is currently no evidence of a return to the epidemic spread of heroin use seen in the 1980s and 1990s, the health and social problems arising from the use of this drug remain considerable’, says EMCDDA Chairman Marcel Reimen. ‘Any indications that the situation may be worsening are grounds for substantial concern’. The EMCDDA estimates that there are between 1.2 and 1.5 million problem opioid users in the EU and Norway, most of these heroin users. New data also suggest that recruitment to heroin use is still occurring, albeit moderately. Based on data from 19 reporting countries, the overall number of new demands for treatment, with heroin as the primary drug, was 6 % greater in 2007 than in 2002 (see Figure TDI-1, part ii). And between 2006 and 2007, eight countries reported that users entering treatment for primary heroin use increased both in number and as a percentage of all clients.  In the period 1990–2006, between 6 400 and 8 500 drug-induced deaths were reported each year in Europe, most of these associated with opioid use (typically over 85 %). Following an overall falling trend in drug-induced deaths between 2000 and 2003, subsequent data show an increasing trend. In 2007, 13 of the 18 reporting countries showed a rise on the previous year (Table DRD-2, part i). Between 2002 and 2007, the number of reported heroin seizures in the EU and Norway rose on average by around 4 % per year. In 2007, an estimated 56 000 seizures were reported (compared with 51 000 seizures in 2006), the highest number being in the UK (Table SZR-7). While the overall amount of heroin seized in the EU and Norway declined after 2002, it increased from 8.1 tonnes in 2006 to 8.8 tonnes in 2007. Turkey, an important transit country for heroin entering the EU, reported a record 13.2 tonnes seized in 2007, compared to 2.7 tonnes in 2002 (Table SZR-8, Chapter 6, Table 9). New data confirm declining cannabis use, particularly among the young Around 74 million Europeans (15–64 years), have tried cannabis in their lifetime, around 22.5 million of them having used it in the last year. This makes cannabis still Europe’s most commonly consumed illicit drug (Chapter 3, Table 3). But, following marked increases in use through the 1990s and early 2000s, new European data confirm the drug’s declining popularity, particularly among the young, reinforcing the analysis in last year’s report. The trend is particularly noticeable among schoolchildren (15–16 years), as shown by the ESPAD surveys (2).  Most west European countries, as well as Croatia and Slovenia, reported a decrease or stabilisation in lifetime cannabis use in 2007, following high prevalence or an upward trend to the 2003 ESPAD survey. In most central and east European countries, the increasing trend to 2003 may be levelling out (only Slovakia and Lithuania report a rise of more than 3 %). A third group of countries, mainly in northern and southern Europe, stand out for their overall stable and low lifetime prevalence of cannabis use from the mid to late 1990s to 2007 (Chapter 3, Figure 4). School survey data from the US and Australia also point to a decreasing trend (Figure EYE-1, part xii). The data available likewise point to a stabilising or downward trend between 2002 and 2007 in last-year cannabis use among young adults (15–34 years) (Figure GPS 4, part ii). But the numbers of regular and intensive cannabis users in Europe are less encouraging. Up to 2.5 % of all young Europeans could be using cannabis on a daily basis, representing a large population at risk and in potential need of assistance. Innovative responses targeting this population include Internet-based drug treatment interventions, on which the EMCDDA launched a first European review in 2009 (3). Polydrug use increases risks and complicates treatment ‘In Europe today, polydrug use patterns are widespread, and the combined use of different substances is responsible for, or complicates, most of the problems we face’, states the report. Published today, alongside the report, is a special review Polydrug use: patterns and responses (4). This provides an overview of this behaviour in schoolchildren (15–16 years), young adults (15–34 years) and problem drug users. Of schoolchildren (15–16 years) surveyed in 22 countries, 20 % reported use in the last month of alcohol with cigarettes; 6 % cannabis with alcohol and/or cigarettes; and 1 % cannabis with alcohol and/or cigarettes plus one other drug (ecstasy, cocaine, amphetamines, LSD or heroin). Research shows that among schoolchildren, polydrug use can increase the risk of toxic effects and chronic health problems later in life. Strategies that address the environment in which young people consume drugs and alcohol (e.g. enforcement of drug and alcohol legislation, safer-clubbing guidelines) appear to have potential for safeguarding health in nightlife settings. Among young adults (15–34 years), polydrug use is symptomatic of more established patterns of substance use and can be associated with increased risks. Frequent or heavy alcohol users in this age group were between two and six times more likely to have used cannabis in the last year than the general population and between two and nine times more likely to have used cocaine during that period. Polydrug use is particularly prevalent among problem drug users and can aggravate their already difficult health conditions, leading to increased risk-taking and possibilities of severe consequences (e.g. fatal overdoses). A recent  analysis of data from 14 countries found that over half (57 %) of those entering treatment reported at least one problem drug in addition to the primary substance for which they were seeking help. Toxicology reports following fatal overdoses (mostly caused by heroin) often show the presence of more than one substance, suggesting that a substantial proportion of these deaths could be polydrug use-related. While specific programmes remain rare, existing interventions, such as opioid substitution treatment and contingency management, are showing some positive results in reducing multiple substance use. The management of polydrug use among problem drug users remains a complex task and challenges treatment professionals in the  delivery of services. Alcohol, a defining factor in Europe’s substance use problem ‘A defining factor in Europe’s substance use problem is the concomitant consumption of alcohol’, states the report, underlining that almost all polydrug use repertoires show the presence of alcohol. The latest ESPAD survey found that 43 % of school students surveyed in 2007 reported ‘heavy episodic drinking’ (five drinks or more per occasion) in the past 30 days. Increases in this behaviour were particularly visible among girls between the 2003 and 2007 surveys, with an increase in prevalence from 35 % to 42 %. Binge drinking often goes hand-in-hand with recreational drug use, increasing the risks of negative outcomes among young people. ‘The individual experiencing problems with a single substance is fast becoming the exception rather than the rule’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘Europe’s drugs problem increasingly stems from the combined use of different psychoactive substances, both licit and illicit. This reality not only leads to more negative outcomes, but also challenges drug treatment services as they respond to a more complex set of needs. Moreover, our policy perspectives need to reflect that the combined use of drugs with alcohol has become a key feature of the problems we now face’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2009/8/cocaine-heroin-cannabis_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0487	2009-11-05	UNK	Message from Wolfgang Götz, Director of the EMCDDA, on the launch of the 2009 annual report	 Below is the text of speech given by Mr. Wolf Götz on the occasion of the launch of the Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe. The past year has been an important one for drug policy, at European and global level. Almost in parallel, the European Union and the United Nations both renewed their drug policy documents, which reflect a strong international commitment to reducing drug use and the harms it can cause (1). Attaining the goals set out in these documents now constitutes a major challenge and one that can only be met if the actions planned are implemented widely. Monitoring and evaluation are key elements in this process, as they allow policies to be kept on course and progress to be charted. The Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe, presents the latest  assessment of Europe’s drug situation. Much of the report’s strength derives from efforts within EU Member States to develop a sound drug monitoring system that now encompasses some 30 European countries. We believe that this monitoring system is not only critical for a mature and informed debate on the drugs problem, but also results in better and more effective policies. We see today that such policies are increasingly necessary as the challenges in the drugs field grow ever more complex. A common theme running through this year’s report is the need for our vision to keep pace with an ever-shifting drug phenomenon. It was around this very issue that the EMCDDA held a conference this year to celebrate 15 years of drug monitoring in Europe. Entitled: ‘Identifying Europe’s information needs for effective drug policy’, it took stock of the existing knowledge base on drugs and set out current and future information needs. The event demonstrated that Europe offers considerable opportunities for collective learning and knowledge sharing in the drugs field and is a ‘formidable laboratory’ for the study and understanding of drug use and related responses. Today’s report shows that, although drug use levels remain high in Europe, we are still in a relatively stable phase as regards the more traditionally used drugs. Overall, for most forms of consumption, we are not seeing major increases and, in some areas, trends appear to be downwards. Indicators for amphetamine and ecstasy use, for example, still suggest an overall steady or declining situation. And, new data confirm a continued fall in cannabis use, particularly among young people. While it is important to acknowledge these positive developments, we must also pay heed to ongoing concerns. Cocaine and heroin continue to maintain a firm hold on Europe’s drug scene, and there is little to suggest at present any improvement regarding their use in Europe. We also note concerns that methamphetamine, a drug associated with severe public health problems around the world, may be diffusing into new territory in Europe. Although this drug is yet to make significant inroads into the stimulant drug market in Western Europe, where cocaine or amphetamine still dominate, the drug appears to be becoming more available in parts of northern Europe, where amphetamine has traditionally been the stimulant drug of choice. These developments stress the need for careful monitoring of this substance in Europe, especially given the relative ease with which it can be produced. Among the issues underscored this year, is Europe’s increasingly complex synthetic drug market, where highly innovative suppliers circumvent drug controls by offering unregulated substitutes. While this practice in itself is not new, what is new is the wide range of substances now on offer; the growing use of the Internet; the aggressive and sophisticated marketing of products (in some cases intentionally mislabelled); and the very speed at which the market reacts to controls. Faced with this ‘moving target’, it is essential that our information systems become more sensitive to monitoring new drugs and trends. It is also crucial that our reporting remain accurate, grounded and non-alarmist. We examine today the appearance of synthetic cannabinoids, which mark the latest stage in the development of ‘designer drugs’. These can produce cannabis-like effects when consumed and appear to be targeting the cannabis market. As the range of available substances grows and drug-taking repertoires become increasingly complex, polydrug use is also one of our key concerns. Polydrug use patterns are currently widespread in Europe, and the combined use of different substances is responsible for, or complicates, most of the problems we face. Published today, alongside the report, is a special review on this issue, which provides an overview of this behaviour in schoolchildren, young adults and problem drug users. Often a complicating factor is the concomitant use of alcohol, a substance present in almost all polydrug use repertoires. The management of polydrug use thus poses a difficult task, challenging treatment professionals who must respond to a more complex set of needs. This brings me to the services now available to drug users in Europe, which are becoming more and more diversified and offered as part of an integrated package of care. Harm-reduction and treatment interventions, for example, are increasingly linked and offered by the same providers. And some countries now show that the integration of drug treatment into general healthcare, such as through general practitioners, can contribute to a broader provision of treatment. While the greatest advances remain in the area of opioid substitution treatment (with a treated population now in the region of 650 000), a growing number of research projects are addressing the treatment needs of stimulant and cannabis users. Drug law enforcement also receives a high profile in this year’s report, and an in-depth review released today explores what happens to those who violate drug laws. Countries are often simplistically labelled as ‘liberal’ or ‘repressive’ when it comes to drug control. But these assertions are meaningless so long as the actual outcomes of drug-law offences remain largely unknown. The review is published as a step towards filling this information gap. Finally, we must remind ourselves that, although understanding Europe’s drug problems is important, more important still is the development of effective policies and interventions to tackle them. While there remains much to be done in this domain, our report acknowledges the progress that has been, and continues to be, made in Europe to reduce the harm that drugs cause our citizens and communities. Today more than ever, understanding that such responses can be effective, is critical. As our Member States face hard choices about funding priorities, it is crucial that those in need of care and support should not be denied it. An implicit message running through our report this year is that well-conceived interventions can deliver real benefits and value. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2009/directorsMessage_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0488	2009-11-05	UNK	New drugs: difficulties of ‘hitting a moving target’	 Europe is faced with an increasingly complex and volatile synthetic drug market, says the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). Suppliers are now ‘highly innovative’ in their production processes, product ranges and marketing and are demonstrating their ability to adapt quickly to controls. The ‘growing sophistication’ in marketing legal alternatives to illicit drugs (so-called ‘legal highs’) is also a worrying development. The difficulties of ‘hitting a moving target’ are described in the Annual report 2009:  the state of the drugs problem in Europe, launched by the EMCDDA today in Brussels. EU early-warning system — allows for better detection of new drugs Europe is making headway in detecting new drugs appearing on the illicit drug market, thanks to the EU early-warning system, set up as a rapid-response mechanism in 1997 (1). Over 90 substances have been tracked through this channel to date. In 2008, 13 new psychoactive substances were reported by EU Member States to the EMCDDA and Europol through the system (2). Of these, 11 were new synthetic drugs and two were plants (kratom and kava). For the first time, a synthetic cannabinoid, JWH-018, was among the reported drugs. This produces cannabis-like effects when smoked (see ‘Spice’ below). Today the EMCDDA releases an online ‘drug profile’ dedicated to synthetic cannabinoids. ‘The appearance of synthetic cannabinoids marks the latest stage in the development of “designer drugs”’, says the report — from the fentanyl-based drugs (1980s), to phenethylamines (late 1980s) and tryptamines (1990s), to piperazines and cathinone derivatives (2000s). Also noteworthy is that, in 2008, compared with previous years, fewer of the substances reported belonged to the main chemical groups (phenethylamines, tryptamines, piperazines). Six of the 13 were derivatives of cathinone, a psychoactive ingredient found in khat. Monitoring the Internet — EMCDDA surveys the online drug market The Internet is now a major marketplace for psychoactive substances, allowing retailers to offer to a broad public alternatives to controlled drugs. Highlighted in this year’s report is the increasingly elaborate online marketing of these ‘legal alternatives’, as suppliers attempt to circumvent controls. Monitoring the Internet is an ‘increasingly important element of identifying new drug trends’, states the report.  In 2009, the EMCDDA surveyed 115 online shops in 17 European countries. The majority of the online retailers identified were based in the UK (37 %), Germany (15 %), the Netherlands (14 %) and Romania (7 %). The wide variety of substances appearing online range from drugs used traditionally in some parts of the world, to chemicals synthesised in laboratories and untested in humans. Among the new products on sale in 2009 are ‘party pills’ containing legal alternatives to the newly-controlled substance BZP (3). Other innovations of the online market include the creation of distinct brands and attractive packaging, a prime example being ‘Spice’. Is ‘Spice’ the taste of things to come? Products marketed under the ‘Spice’ brand, and often sold as incense, have been monitored through the early-warning system since early 2008. Packaging information claims that these are a blend of plant or herbal materials (as many as 14 ingredients) (4). But, recent tests have shown some batches also to contain synthetic cannabinoids. Up to October 2009, JWH-018 and eight other synthetic cannabinoids had been identified in ‘Spice' products in Europe. These ingredients do not feature in the product information and may therefore be consumed unknowingly. The EMCDDA reveals that in 2009, almost half (48 %) of the 115 online retailers surveyed were offering ‘Spice’. While these were based in 14 European countries, the largest number were located in the UK (42 %), and significant numbers in Romania (15 %), Ireland (7 %) and Latvia (7 %). ‘Spice’ was also found to be available in ‘head’ or ‘smart’ shops — commercial outlets selling ‘legal highs’ — in at least nine EU Member States (Czech Republic, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Austria, Poland, Portugal, UK). Concerns over synthetic cannabinoids have led a number of countries to take legal action to ban or otherwise control ‘Spice’ products or related compounds (Germany, Estonia, France, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Austria, Poland and Sweden). At least 27 herbal smoking blends have recently been found marketed online as alternatives to ‘Spice’, using a wide variety of names (e.g. ‘Smoke’, ‘Sence’). The speedy appearance of ‘Spice’ substitutes underlines the ability of this market to respond rapidly to changes in the legal status of psychoactive substances. Commenting today EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘Attempts to circumvent drug controls by marketing unregulated substitutes are not new. What is new is the wide range of substances now being explored, the aggressive marketing of products that have been intentionally mislabelled, the growing use of the Internet, and the speed at which the market reacts to control measures. If Spice is a taste of things to come, Europe will need to ensure that its responses are adequate to tackle this growing challenge’. Other developments in the synthetic drug market Recent changes in the ecstasy market According to today’s report, most ecstasy tablets analysed until 2007 typically contained MDMA or another ecstasy-like substance (e.g. MDA, MDEA). However, more recent, preliminary data suggest that this may be changing in some EU countries. For example, in around half of the ‘ecstasy’ tablets seized or sold in Denmark and the Netherlands, no MDMA was found, but instead tablets contained mCPP (5).   Changes in the ecstasy market may be the result of the increasingly successful efforts to prevent the diversion of precursors, the controlled chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs (see box, Chapter 4). The shortage of PMK, a key precursor used to make MDMA, could be one explanation for the recent changes in the make-up of ecstasy. It cannot yet be said if this development is temporary or marks a more significant shift in the market.  The EMCDDA and Europol will be bringing out a joint analysis of the ecstasy market in 2010. Europe remains the main location for ecstasy production, which is concentrated in the Netherlands and Belgium, and to a lesser extent Germany, the UK and Poland. Some 13 million ecstasy tablets were intercepted in Europe in 2007. It is estimated that 10 million European adults (15–64 years) have tried ecstasy in their lifetime and around 2.5 million have used it in the past year. Most of the users are young adults (15–34 years) — around 7.5 million of them have ever tried ecstasy and some 2 million have used it in the last year. Trends in ecstasy use are generally stable in Europe (see Figure GPS-21, parts i and ii). Methamphetamine edges into new territory Methamphetamine is yet to make significant inroads into the stimulant drug market in western Europe, where cocaine or amphetamine still dominate. However, there are some signs that methamphetamine is starting to edge into new territory. Historically, methamphetamine use in Europe has been concentrated in the Czech Republic. Today’s report informs, however, that the drug appears to be becoming more available in parts of northern Europe, such as Norway and Sweden, where amphetamine has traditionally been the stimulant drug of choice. Market factors and precursor chemicals again seem important here, with production sites appearing to be located in Lithuania, whose geographical position may facilitate the importation of the methamphetamine precursor BMK from  outside the EU. In 2007, almost 4 500 seizures of methamphetamine, amounting to approximately 340 kg were reported in Europe. Norway accounted for by far the highest number of seizures (1 284) and the largest amount of methamphetamine recovered (167 kg). The second largest amount of methamphetamine seized in Europe  (51 kg) was in Sweden (see Tables SZR 17 and SZR 18). Methamphetamine production in Europe has traditionally taken place in small-scale kitchen laboratories in the Czech Republic, where small quantities are produced usually for personal or local consumption (around 390 of these laboratories were detected in 2007). However Europol now reports that a small number of larger sites have been detected and dismantled in other parts of Europe, such as Germany and the Netherlands (6). Today’s report warns that ‘given the relative ease with which methamphetamine can be produced and the considerable negative impact that this drug can have on public health, there is no room for complacency’. A case in point is Slovakia, a country where methamphetamine problems have grown significantly in recent years. Around a quarter (26 %) of clients entering treatment in Slovakia now report methamphetamine as their primary drug. Commenting on today’s findings, Director Wolfgang Götz concludes: ‘The speed at which the drug market is moving and evolving, illustrates how globalisation and innovation present countries with a growing challenge. Current approaches to monitoring and responding to the use of new psychoactive substances will also need to evolve if they are to keep pace with this shifting phenomenon’.   	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2009/9/new-drugs-moving-target_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0491	2009-09-21	UNK	Croatian Deputy Prime Minister and dignitaries pay study visit to EU drugs agency	 Deputy Prime Minister of Croatia, Đurđa Adlešič, visited the EMCDDA today as the country prepares for membership of this EU agency. Ms Adlešič, who is also president of the Commission on Combating Narcotic Drug Abuse of the Croatian Government, was joined by a 20-strong delegation. Among the dignitaries were: Neven Mimica, Deputy Speaker of the Croatian Parliament and President of the Committee on European Integration; Stjepan Adanić, State Secretary at the Ministry of Family, Veterans’ Affairs and Intergenerational Solidarity; Milanka Opačić, President of the Committee on Family, Youth and Sport; and other high-level parliamentary representatives in the areas of health, social welfare and domestic policy. The delegation also boasted a strong technical team of experts working in the drugs field, including the heads of the governmental Office for Combating Narcotic Drug Abuse and the Croatian Reitox national focal point (1).  The purpose of today’s visit was to prepare for the country’s formal participation in the work of the agency.  This will begin on ratification of an agreement, initialled in Brussels in July, between the European Community and the Republic of Croatia, concerning the country’s participation in the work of the EMCDDA. Ratification is expected to take place in the coming months, at which point Croatia will enjoy the same relationship with the agency as Norway. Practically, this means that the country will become member of the agency, will participate as observer in its Management Board and will formally report national data into the European monitoring system. The Republic of Croatia is already an active partner in the Reitox network, thanks to a preparatory process supported by the European Commission’s Phare and IPA programmes (2). Today’s meeting allowed the participants to identify how to ensure the smooth integration of Croatian data into the broader European picture and review areas where Croatia can contribute to activities under the EMCDDA three-year work programme (2010–12). Also examined were the numerous technical cooperation activities already developed by the EMCDDA with Croatia under European Commission programmes. Commenting today, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: 'This new working relationship is a major step towards consolidating Croatia's national drug monitoring capacity and building a firm evidence base on the country's drug situation in the European context. In turn, this will present us with a more complete overview of Europe's drug phenomenon and facilitate sound policymaking in the field.' ‘We are aware that the prerequisites for an informed and science-based approach to developing policies and measures to be undertaken can only be created by providing a comprehensive, objective and analytical overview of the situation regarding drugs and drug addiction’, said Đurđa Adlešič. ‘Through this new  agreement, Croatia makes its contribution to a comprehensive approach to the problems relating to drug abuse in Europe’. A similar agreement regarding the EMCDDA has been agreed with Turkey and is pending ratification by the latter. Participation of the candidate countries in Community agencies is an important part of the EU's pre-accession strategy as it involves the candidate countries in EU policies and helps them prepare for accession to the EU. From 25–27 November 2009, the EMCDDA will host a conference near Lisbon entitled: 'Community agencies: your partners in accession', financed by the IPA programme. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2009/6/republic-croatia-member-emcdda_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0492	2009-09-18	UNK	Responding to drug driving in Europe	 Many of the accidents and deaths that occur on European roads are caused by drivers whose performance is impaired by a psychoactive substance. Alcohol alone is estimated to account for up to 10 000 road deaths a year in the EU, one quarter of all road deaths (1). But, says the EMCDDA, no comparable figures are available for road accidents relating to illcit drugs and psychoactive medicines. This means that, with no clear picture of the problem, tailoring responses will prove difficult. The need to gather evidence on drugs and driving, as a basis for effective responses in prevention and enforcement, is underlined in the latest edition of Drugs in focus, the EMCDDA’s policy briefing. In it, the agency summarises key issues now facing policymakers in this area and outlines innovative developments. ‘Reducing the loss of life caused by driving under the influence of psychoactive substances requires measures that are based on a scientific understanding of this complex phenomenon’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘The challenge to legislators is to design sound and effective laws that can be enforced, and that give a clear message to the public’. The release of the publication to policymakers is timely. At the start of the European road safety programme in 2003, it was estimated that over 40,000 people were dying on Europe’s roads every year. The programme set the ambitious target of halving the number of road deaths in Europe by the end of 2010. Next year the European Commission’s DRUID project (Driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs and medicines), which provides scientific support to this target, also comes to a close (2). DRUID aims to provide a solid basis for harmonised, EU-wide regulations for driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs and medicines. Policy considerations presented in today’s briefing include: Surveys on the prevalence of drugs in drivers should be carried out in all EU Member States. At minimum, testing all drivers involved in a fatal accident for drugs and alcohol would provide an important source of information for monitoring the problem. Despite a European Commission recommendation in 2002 for such tests, few countries have adopted them and data remain scarce. Studies undertaken in this field need to be comparable if results are to be compiled. The EMCDDA and the European Commission have contributed to new international guidelines on study design that take into account differences between countries’ legislation and testing policies. These provide over 100 recommendations in the areas of behaviour, epidemiology and toxicology (3). Legal definitions of driving under the influence of drugs differ among EU Member States. Eleven countries have adopted a ‘zero tolerance’ approach penalising any driving after drug taking. Eleven others only penalise when there is evidence that driving performance has been impaired. Seven countries use a tiered response using both approaches. The level at which a driver will be deemed in breach of the law should be clear for all stakeholders and the public. Psychoactive medicines, whether consumed legally or not, can impair driving skills. National laws and their enforcement need to strike a balance between concerns about ensuring road safety and the therapeutic needs of individuals; to this end, some countries have adopted a two-tier penalty system. Providing clear information, such as a pictogram, on psychoactive medicines that affect driving ability may prevent patients from driving while adversely affected. But this is currently reported by only five countries. As yet there is no agreement on a reliable on-site saliva-testing device. The EU’s Rosita-2 project could not recommend any of the nine devices evaluated between 2003 and 2005. In France, drivers are screened with saliva tests, but prosecution is based on a blood sample. For this reason, police experience considerable difficulty with the accurate and rapid identification of drug driving at the roadside. With no reliable testing device available, traffic police need more training in spotting signs of impairment due to drugs. Despite a call by the European Commission in 2002 for mandatory training for traffic police, by 2007 only four countries (Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, UK) reported obligatory training in this area. General messages that reach young cannabis users are unlikely to be listened to, or even noticed, by older users of psychoactive medicines and vice versa. Similarly, both groups may feel that warnings about alcohol do not apply to them. Thus, key audiences may not be hearing the message, or they may be ignoring it. Prevention efforts are more likely to succeed if they are tailored to specific substances and groups. After alcohol, cannabis and benzodiazepines are the psychoactive substances most prevalent among Europe’s driving population. Studies on the impact of psychoactive substances on driving performance suggest that while both illicit and therapeutic drugs can affect driving, the effects can vary greatly from substance to substance. Drugs in focus No 20 is available in 25 languages.

From now on, it can be contacted at the following address: European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência (OEDT) Cais do Sodré, 1249-289 Lisbon, Portugal Tel. (351) 211 21 02 00 — Fax (351) 218 13 17 11 info[a]emcdda.europa.eu — www.emcdda.europa.eu Established in 1993, the drugs agency has been based in Lisbon since 1995 and is the hub of drug-related information in Europe. Its mission is to provide the EU and its Member States with an evidence base on the European drugs problem to inform policymaking and practice. The EMCDDA’s flagship product is its yearly overview of the European drug phenomenon which it releases in a report every autumn. The move follows the signing in April 2009 of a 25-year lease agreement with owner of the property, the Lisbon Port Authority. Commenting, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘We would like to thank the Portuguese authorities, the EU institutions and the Member-State representatives on our Management Board for all their efforts in making this relocation possible. The current premises provide us with new improved working conditions and enhanced visibility in the agency’s hometown’. This is the first time in six years that EMCDDA staff members have been housed under the same roof, having been split over two sites since 2003. The new EMCDDA building forms part of a larger European complex shared with the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), based in Lisbon since 2006, and the Jacques Delors European Information Centre (Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2009/fs5_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0494	2009-07-13	UNK	EMCDDA and Europol release joint report on methamphetamine	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the European Police Office (Europol) released today the first edition in a new series of joint publications covering key aspects of European drug markets. The launch of the series is one of several collaborative activities agreed by the two bodies for the period 2009–12 (1). Issue No 1, Methamphetamine — a European Union perspective in the global context, reviews key issues relevant to understanding how Europe stands vis-à-vis the global methamphetamine problem. Among others, it presents information on the history, production, trafficking and use of the substance, which is probably the most widely consumed synthetic stimulant in the world today. Globally, methamphetamine is associated with significant public health, social and security problems, which are especially visible in North America and Asia. The use of the drug is also reportedly spreading to new areas, notably in the southern hemisphere and to some developing and transitional countries. In many countries across the globe, it is reportedly the second most prevalent illicit drug after cannabis. In Europe as a whole, the market for stimulant drugs has historically been centred on cocaine and amphetamine, with methamphetamine posing significant problems mainly in the Czech Republic — and to a lesser extent Slovakia. For over 30 years, ‘pervitin’, as methamphetamine is known locally, has been the second most prevalent drug after cannabis in the Czech Republic. According to the report, some limited diffusion may also be occurring in other countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Moreover, large seizures in recent years in the Nordic and neighbouring countries suggest that methamphetamine is increasingly available in these countries and may, to some extent, be replacing amphetamine in the stimulant market. Combined with the relative ease with which the drug can be produced, this raises concerns that future supply-driven diffusion cannot be ruled out and underlines the need for careful monitoring. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2009/fs4/europol-emcdda-methamphetamine-report_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0495	2009-07-01	UNK	EMCDDA Management Board renews mandate of Wolfgang Götz	 During its meeting in Lisbon today, the EMCDDA Management Board decided unanimously to renew the mandate of Wolfgang Götz as Director of the EU drugs agency for a further term of five years starting 1 May 2010. Fifty-seven-year-old Mr Götz was elected EMCDDA Director in spring 2005 and will now hold the Director’s position until April 2015. The Chairman of the Board, Mr Marcel Reimen, welcomed the re-appointment of Mr Götz stating: ‘He has shown full commitment to the endeavour he embarked upon in 2005, in particular enhancing the scientific quality and efficiency of the agency’s work’. During his first mandate, Mr Götz has paid special attention to providing policymakers with evidence-based information for a more informed and reasoned debate on the drugs problem. Under his guidance, the agency has forged stronger relations with the EU institutions and international bodies, and other world regions have shown increased interest in the EU drugs information model and in cooperating with the EMCDDA. Commenting on his renewal, Mr Götz said: ‘My re-appointment coincides with two major EMCDDA events. Firstly, we are about to launch into a new ambitious EMCDDA three-year work programme for 2010–2012. Secondly, we are about to move from our current two buildings to our new common premises at Cais do Sodré. The re-appointment gives me renewed energy to pursue the goals and activities set out in the new work programme and to engage further in my long-term commitment to strengthening the scientific performance of the EMCDDA.’ 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2009/5/emcdda-director-renewal_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0496	2009-06-26	UNK	World drugs day: advances in brain research throw light on addiction, says EU drugs agency	 How people become addicted to drugs and why they may find it difficult to stop are  issues explored by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) today in new material released ahead of International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking (26 June). The information package, dedicated to emerging research in neurobiology, examines the social, ethical and policy implications of scientific developments in this field. How addiction is understood by society plays a pivotal role in shaping drug laws, policies and interventions. Drug addiction can be viewed as a disorder whereby the individual loses control over his or her consumption. Addicts may wish to quit, but find it hard to do so, despite often experiencing negative effects. Advances in brain research now provide a better understanding of how dependence develops, and offer the potential for new prevention strategies and psychological and pharmacological treatments. These issues are addressed today in a new EMCDDA monograph Addiction neurobiology: ethical and social implications. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘Across Europe, we pay a heavy price for the addiction of many of our citizens to illicit drugs, alcohol and tobacco. Although improvements have been made over the last decade in treating some forms of drug use, overall the therapeutic arsenal in this area remains insufficient. Developments in neuroscience now provide us with a growing understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying dependence and raise the exciting hope of new opportunities for prevention and treatment’. State-of-the-art research and technology Also released today is an EMCDDA briefing paper for policymakers Neurobiological research on drugs: ethical and policy implications. According to the paper, most neurobiological research to date has focused on the fact that addictive drugs increase the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the brain which helps individuals memorise signals of pleasure or ‘reward’. New findings suggest that serotonin and noradrenaline (which work as a couple controlling impulsivity and asserting vigilance) are also involved in the addiction process. The briefing describes how chronic drug use disrupts this coupling, making a person more prone to cravings and less capable of controlling consumption. New discoveries in neurobiology have the potential to transform some of our responses to drug problems and open up the possibility for a wider range of technologies to treat, or even prevent, addiction. Therapies under development include: vaccines that bind to the target drug (e.g. cocaine) in the bloodstream, preventing it from reaching the brain; and slow-release drug implants, allowing a gradual reduction in dose. Genetic testing is also helping scientists identify genes that may make a person susceptible to addiction. And the latest neuroimaging techniques can now look inside the brain and shed light on addictive processes. Optimism tempered by ethical concerns But while research in neuroscience may hold the promise of new treatment possibilities, many of the approaches reviewed today remain untested and raise important ethical concerns. ‘Along with the considerable potential for good comes a potential for significant harm’, states the monograph, warning against the misuse of these new approaches (e.g. coercion of addicts into highly invasive or possibly damaging treatments; abuses of privacy). One of the approaches singled out as unlikely to prove ethically acceptable is neurosurgery. Also raising ethical concerns, but less invasive than neurosurgery, is deep brain stimulation, where electrical stimulating electrodes are inserted into the parts of the brain involved in addiction. EMCDDA Chairman Marcel Reimen says: ‘There is a pressing need to explore the ethical and policy implications of addiction neuroscience research to ensure that developments are taken forward in ways that adequately safeguard human rights and protect the ethical values of consent, liberty, equality and privacy’.  He adds that: ‘Any potential new approaches will require rigorous evaluation for safety and efficacy before being introduced into routine practice’. ‘No magic bullet cure’ — need to support further research ‘Although important new prevention and treatment approaches are likely to emerge from this work, they are no magic bullet cure for the complex problems that drug use causes for the individual and society’, says Director Wolfgang Götz. ‘There is a need to continue supporting studies in this area, whilst reviewing how European research can be encouraged and best organised’, adds Götz. He recalls the recent EMCDDA conference — 'Identifying Europe’s information needs for effective drug policy' — which stressed the importance of new scientific findings and methodologies which increase our understanding of the mechanisms behind drug use and addiction. Concluding Götz says: ‘A major challenge for drugs policy will be to develop approaches that benefit from the advances offered by an understanding of the neurobiological basis of addiction but that are also sensitive to the complex nature of drug problems. It is important to recognise that drug use and addiction are affected by individual and social choices as well as by underlying biological processes’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2009/4/international-drugs-day_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0497	2009-05-08	UNK	EMCDDA 15 years: conference highlights	 Experts and policymakers gathering this week in Lisbon for an international conference, underlined the need for rapid and innovative responses to Europe’s changing drugs problem. Organised by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), and commemorating 15 years of monitoring Europe’s drug phenomenon, the event was dedicated to 'Identifying Europe’s information needs for effective drug policy'. Some 300 policymakers, researchers and practitioners from Europe, North America and Australia, considered the major challenges arising from today’s drug situation, and the type of information required to respond to it in future. They also took stock of achievements to date, including the creation of an extensive regional monitoring system (Reitox network) — which now provides comparable drugs information from some 30 countries — and  a European early-warning system, which detects new and potentially threatening drugs entering the illicit market. Speaking at the closing session today, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘This conference has demonstrated that Europe is a formidable laboratory of ideas and experiences, and an extraordinary reservoir of people and talents. By bringing these together, the meeting has helped us take stock of the progress made, which is considerable, but also identify the tasks that lie ahead of us. As such, it has been an important milestone in monitoring and responding to drugs in Europe.’ Since the agency began reporting in the early 1990s, the nature of Europe’s drugs problem has evolved. Although drug use in Europe is now entering a more stable phase, new challenges have appeared in recent years. These include growing cocaine and polydrug use, new psychoactive substances and the misuse of prescription medicines. Strong mechanisms are now in place in Europe to carry out regular and sustained drug monitoring of developments as well as to ensure rapid responses to new substances. ‘A clear message from this conference’, Götz added, ‘is that we have a growing understanding of what works in the drugs field. We now need to make the most of this knowledge to ensure that comprehensive and effective services become available for those with drug problems across the EU’. The conference was inaugurated by Prime Minister of Portugal, José Sócrates who underlined the fact that, being seated in Portugal, the EMCDDA had contributed a great deal to the development and maturity of the national drug policy, which he considered both ‘just and successful’. Guest of honour at the closing session was President of the Portuguese Republic, Aníbal Cavaco Silva who declared: ‘Drug addiction is a sickness. As such, we have to prevent and treat it. Drug dependence, as any other illness, is not a purely individual matter. It is the result of an unhappy union of predisposition and vulnerability, associated with availability and opportunity. It is a product of people, of places and of moments. For this reason, tackling drugs is a clear example of the need to join forces to act simultaneously on various fronts’. Highlights ‘Detecting new drugs coming our way’ — concerns over synthetic cannabinoid Reflecting on ‘New drugs coming our way — what are they and how to detect them?’, experts at the conference discussed the implications of the over 90 new substances reported to the EMCDDA and Europol since 1997 through the European early-warning system. (The most recent drug brought under control across the EU Member States, following monitoring through the system, was the stimulant drug BZP, in March 2008). Attention was given at the conference to ‘Spice’, observed through the system since early 2008 (speaker: L. King). Although a blend of plant or herbal materials, often marketed as air freshener, some EU countries have expressed concerns over ‘Spice’ products. This follows reports by some users that, when smoked, they had similar effects to those produced by cannabis. Participants at the conference heard how recent tests had shown some samples to contain synthetic cannabinoids (e.g. JWH-018) which mimic the effects of Δ9-THC, the primary active ingredient in cannabis. The event reviewed the level of preparedness in Europe to new developments of this kind and the potential implications for public health. Mapping Europe’s changing cannabis market: new figures released at conference New estimates released at the conference show that some 1 750 tonnes of cannabis are consumed in the European Union and Norway every year, according to an EMCDDA-funded study, undertaken by its French partner, the Observatoire français des drogues et des toxicomanies. The study, which maps Europe’s changing cannabis market, reveals that this total volume of cannabis consumed could equate to a retail value of € 9.6 billion (€ 92 billion for alcohol, €143 billion for tobacco). To be released later this year, the study reports on changes in cannabis supply and demand, including increased domestic production in the EU and the market shares and potencies of different cannabis products, particularly ‘home-grown’ varieties. Also discussed at the conference was the reported decline of cannabis production in Morocco, long-time supplier of the drug to Europe. By uncovering market changes, the study will contribute to more efficient responses to cannabis use and trafficking in Europe. New analysis of data on cannabis use in Europe suggests that around 20% of the drug is being seized by law-enforcement officials (speaker: J-M.Costes, www.ofdt.fr). Conference reviews latest trends in illicit drug use among European school students  Use of illicit drugs among 15–16-year-old school students, appears to have stabilised or slightly fallen, according to the latest European study of this group published by ESPAD. The 2007 ESPAD report: substance use among students in 35 European countries also reveals a decrease in last-month rates of cigarette smoking among school students. However, it sounds the alarm over clear rises in the group’s ‘heavy episodic drinking’, and the narrowing gender gap in this behaviour. This is the fourth data-collection wave conducted by the ESPAD project, with multi-national surveys providing a window on substance use in 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2007. The data show that, overall, the increase in illicit drug use (mainly cannabis) between 1995 and 2003, had come to a halt, if not a decrease, in 2007. Around 19% of students surveyed had tried cannabis in their lifetime and 7% had tried it in the last month (speaker: B. Hibbell). The ESPAD report is complemented by a multilingual summary produced with the EMCDDA. 'Messages that click': new European study on Internet-based drug treatment Information exchange through the Internet benefits both sides of the illicit drug market. While the Web greatly enhances the marketing opportunities of drug producers, it is also becoming a key medium for communicating information in the field of public health. In a new European study released at the conference today, the EMCDDA provides a state-of-the art review of Internet-based drug treatment interventions. This innovative approach has already shown some promising results. Experts debated its potential to reach young people early in their drug-using careers — who may feel ill-at-ease at traditional drug treatment centres — as well as to help those with drug problems in rural areas. Also noted is the ease with which these treatment programmes can be translated and exchanged between countries (speaker P. Tossmann). Monitoring drugs in a technological age New scientific findings that increase our understanding of the mechanisms behind drug use and addiction — and which are leading to new approaches in the treatment of drug problems — were presented by the conference participants. Among others, they explored technological developments in biomedicine, genetic and brain research and new methods to detect drug use by analysing wastewater. This discussion precedes a major new EMCDDA study to be released later this month on Addiction neurobiology: ethical and social implications. This explores the potential of this emerging science to impact on the way we respond to drug addiction. Independent, science-based information, a key resource The creation of the EMCDDA in 1993 symbolised a major political decision to build drug-related policies on scientific and technical findings. Independent, science-based information is now seen as a key resource to help Europe understand the nature of its drug problems. On this topic, Francisco Fonseca Morillo, Director at the Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security, at the European Commission said: ‘We are convinced that evidence-based drug policies are the way forward, not only for Europe but also for the rest of the world’. Addressing the conference, Marcel Reimen, Chairman and long-serving member of the EMCDDA Management Board, paid tribute to the agency, saying: ‘You have succeeded in supporting policymaking on drugs. While political convergence within the great EU family is still progressing, there is now a clear convergence on the utility of reliable and comparable drug data, thanks to the work of the EMCDDA’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2009/3/15-year-conference-highlights_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0498	2009-03-26	UNK	'ESPAD, a crucial window onto adolescent substance use', says EU drugs agency	 Use of illicit drugs among 15–16-year-old school students, appears to have stabilised or slightly fallen, according to the latest European study of this group published today by ESPAD. The report, which follows a 2007 survey conducted in 35 European countries, also reveals a decrease in last-month rates of cigarette smoking among school students. However, it sounds the alarm over clear rises in the group's  ‘heavy episodic drinking', and the narrowing gender gap in this behaviour. This is the fourth data-collection wave conducted by the ESPAD project, with multi-national surveys carried out in 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2007. Over 100,000 school students took part in the latest survey. Of the countries participating, 25 were EU Member States. The 2007 ESPAD report: substance use among students in 35 countries, available in English, will be complemented by a multilingual summary produced with the support of the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA). The EMCDDA includes ESPAD data in its annual reporting on the drug situation and the two bodies work closely together under a cooperation framework signed in 2007. One of the aims of this accord is to broaden access to the information and expertise gathered by the project. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz said: ‘Information collected by the ESPAD project offers us a crucial window onto country differences and changes in adolescent substance use in Europe today. It also provides us with valuable insights into adolescent perceptions about the associated risks and availability of the various substances. The long-term picture we are now able to draw from these repeated surveys supports other indicators which point to stabilising or even falling adolescent cannabis use. Less positively, the report highlights harmful patterns of alcohol use, which call for broad-based health education approaches when addressing the prevention of substance use among young people'. According to today's report, an average 61 % of school students surveyed in 2007 had consumed alcohol in the past month. And 43 % reported ‘heavy episodic drinking' (five drinks or more per occasion) in the past 30 days. Increases in this behaviour were particularly visible among girls between the 2003 and 2007 surveys, with an increase from 35 % to 42 %. While in the 1995 survey this drinking pattern was on average more common among boys than girls, the gap had diminished substantially by 2007. Some 29 % of those surveyed had smoked cigarettes in the past month. The overall trend in last-month cigarette smoking in the participating countries is one of a decrease or stabilisation. Average prevalence rates in last-month smoking dropped by seven percentage points between the 1999 and 2007 surveys, and the earlier gender gap has now vanished. The vast majority of the students surveyed in 2007, and who had ever tried an illicit drug, had used cannabis.  Lifetime cannabis use was reported by 19 % of the students and last-month use by an average 7 %. ESPAD data show that, overall, the increase in illicit drug use (mainly cannabis) between 1995 and 2003, had come to a halt, if not a decrease, in 2007. And there were no increases in any country for last-month use of cannabis   between 2003 and 2007. In 2007, some 7 % had tried in their lifetime one or more other illicit drugs (ecstasy,  amphetamines, hallucinogens, cocaine, crack, heroin), although considerable differences existed between countries. Non-prescribed use of tranquillisers or sedatives remained fairly stable between 1995 and 2007 (around 7 % in 2007), with slightly more girls (8 %) than boys (5 %) having done so. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2009/1/espad-survey-2007-published_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0499	2009-03-16	UNK	EMCDDA and Europol step up cooperation on drugs and crime	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the European Police Office (Europol), stepped up their cooperation on drugs and crime today by approving a series of collaborative activities for the period 2009–12. The action was taken in the framework of a ‘Cooperation Agreement’ signed by the organisations in Brussels on 19 November 2001 (1). At a ceremony in the Hague, EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz and Europol Director Max-Peter Ratzel signed an addendum to a pledge taken in 2005 to strengthen their cooperation, specifically through activities over the period 2005–08 (2). Each objective listed in today’s document is accompanied by specific actions, indicators and a timeframe to facilitate the implementation and monitoring of the cooperation. This latest cooperation cycle (2009–12) takes into account recent developments at EU level. In particular, it foresees joint activities in relation to the: EU drugs action plan 2009–12 (e.g. a joint presentation on the state of the drugs problem in Europe; assistance to the European Commission in preparing an annual progress review on implementation of the plan); exchange of methodology and strategic information (e.g. on drug seizures, prices, purity, drug markets, supply reduction and new trends); and implementation of the 2005 Council Decision on the information exchange, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances (3) (e.g. regular information exchange, risk assessments). Since 2005, the EMCDDA and Europol have been required to produce an annual report to the European Parliament, Council and the Commission on the implementation of the Council Decision. The 2008 report was formally submitted to the institutions today and will be available to the public in April. Max-Peter Ratzel, who took up the post of Europol Director in 2005, leaves the organisation this spring. Europol, is set to become an EU agency in 2010. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2009/fs3/emcdda-europol-cooperation_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0500	2009-03-05	UNK	Women’s voices — experiences and perceptions of women facing drug problems	 A collection of narratives from women facing drug-related problems in Europe is released by the EMCDDA today ahead of International Women’s Day (8 March). It is estimated that around one in four drug users entering treatment is female, and that women account for one in five drug-related deaths. Yet most drug services today are designed with male drug users in mind, as they remain the predominant client group. Epidemiological studies routinely collect quantitative data on gender differences in drug use (e.g. prevalence, mortality), but far less is published on the qualitative aspects of female drug problems. In this optic, today’s review — Women’s voices — presents quotations gleaned from interviews with women in eight countries. Through these testimonies, the report illustrates how qualitative research can provide glimpses into the experiences and perceptions of women facing drug issues that statistics alone cannot provide. It is widely recognised that drug policy and programme effectiveness are enhanced when gender differences are acknowledged and the needs of both sexes addressed. In November 2008, an EMCDDA expert group agreed that drug treatment guidelines should take account of ‘service-user views’ in order to understand treatment needs and plan appropriate responses. The quotations, selected from grey literature (e.g. research studies, government reports) focus mainly on women in their role as mothers, sex workers or prisoners, and on their vulnerabilities related to physical and sexual abuse. Some of the quotations highlighted today are invocations by women for better services to alleviate their drug problems and provide them with necessary social support. Others are calls to reduce the stigma imposed on them and to recognise their achievements in controlling their drug use and fulfilling their social roles.    The testimonies gathered do not claim to represent the situation of all drug-using women in Europe. They do, however, illustrate an overarching theme: the struggle that female drug users face in fulfilling their social roles and the need for holistic interventions for female drug users. According to the EMCDDA, qualitative research focuses on the meanings, perceptions, process and context of drug service users (and potential users) and offers a way to understand their needs and plan responses. As one expert cited in the report affirms (1): ‘Gender-responsive policies and programming for women do not fall from the sky. They are anchored in “Nothing about us without us” principles, with systematic inclusion of women drug users in the design, planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluation of policies, strategies and programmes’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2009/fs2/womens-day_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0501	2009-02-20	UNK	New EMCDDA thematic paper on indicated prevention	 The EMCDDA releases today its latest online thematic paper entitled: Preventing later substance use disorders in at-risk children and adolescents: a review of the theory and evidence base of indicated prevention. The review adds to the current knowledge and understanding of risk factors in the development of later drug problems and dependence, focusing on the mental health and behavioural problems that develop during childhood. Indicated prevention is a relatively new branch of drug prevention and can be seen as the third part of the ‘prevention chain’, after universal and selective prevention. Its aim is not necessarily to prevent drug use or initiation to it, but rather to prevent the development of dependence, diminish frequency of use and avert ‘dangerous’ patterns of substance use (e.g. moderate instead of binge-drinking). Indicated prevention is thus applied when individuals are already showing ‘signs or symptoms’ of problem substance use (1) or are displaying behaviours that may predict its rapid development later in life (e.g. psychiatric disorders, falling school grades, anti-social behaviour). Focusing on personal vulnerability factors, it differs from universal prevention (which targets whole populations) and selective prevention (which targets vulnerable groups considered ‘at risk’ of developing drug problems due to social reasons). The target of indicated prevention is the individual identified by screening procedures (e.g. professional evaluation; referral by parents, teachers, social workers, paediatricians) or who turns up voluntarily for assistance (self-referral). The review identifies models of best practice for prevention activities targeting vulnerable children (e.g. primary school age) and adolescents in European countries. Drawing on the current scientific literature, it describes the results of research into psychosocial and individual risk and protective factors. The neurobiology of drug use and how childhood psychiatric or behavioural disorders can predispose to problem drug and alcohol use are also described in detail, as are ethical issues raised by indicated prevention. Finally the report offers a wealth of practical information. This includes guidelines for the assessment and treatment of specific psychiatric risk conditions for adolescent substance use, and detailed information on the indicated prevention programmes that have been identified in the study. Conclusions, recommendations and summaries complete the picture, making this a user-friendly resource. One important message of the report is that more networking is necessary to detect and support high-risk individuals. A key aim of the publication is to help establish the common understanding that is required to enable this level of networking among those involved in the care of vulnerable young people. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2009/fs1/indicated-prevention_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0502	2009-01-06	UNK	EMCDDA to celebrate 15 years of drug monitoring with international conference	 'Identifying Europe’s information needs for effective drug policy', will be the focus of an international conference to be hosted by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in Lisbon from 6–8 May. Commemorating 15 years of monitoring Europe’s drug situation, the event will reflect on past achievements and future challenges. Independent, science-based information is a vital resource to help Europe understand the nature of its drug problems and better respond to them. It was on this premise, and in the face of an escalating drug phenomenon, that the EMCDDA was established in 1993. Following preliminary monitoring tasks in 1994, the agency was inaugurated in Lisbon the following year. Illicit drug use and trafficking are worldwide phenomena that threaten health and social stability. Statistics show that around one in three young Europeans has tried an illicit drug and, on average, one of our citizens dies every hour from a drug overdose. Meanwhile, ever-changing patterns in supply and demand call for constant monitoring and dynamic responses. The purpose of the conference will be to identify key questions and challenges arising from a constantly evolving drug situation and to assess the type of information needed to address it in the coming years. The event will  bring together some 300 policymakers, researchers and practitioners from Europe, North America and Australia, as well as representatives from international organisations, to focus on the following themes: Policy: Information needs for policy — implications for monitoring and science Practice: Making the link between science and practice Trends: Monitoring a fast-moving, complex phenomenon Horizons: Arising issues (e.g. new scientific findings, research needs) The conference conclusions will be used by the EMCDDA and its national partners to shape future activities and generate the evidence base needed to respond effectively to the problem and support the drugs debate. Venue: Centro de Congressos de Lisboa (CCL), Praça das Indústrias, 1300-307 Lisbon Closing session: Friday 8 May (12.10–13.00). Dignitaries include His Excellency, the President of the Portuguese Republic Aníbal Cavaco Silva (open to the media) Press briefing (with lunch): Friday 8 May (13.15), CCL Conference website The EMCDDA exists to provide the EU and its Member States with ‘factual, objective, reliable and comparable information’ on drugs and drug addiction and their consequences. It now supplies policymakers with the data they need for drawing up informed drug laws and strategies and helps professionals and practitioners working in the field pinpoint best practice and new areas of research. Every year, it publishes a snapshot of European drug facts, figures and trends in its Annual report: the state of the drugs problem in Europe. As well as monitoring the drug situation today, the agency is ever vigilant to potentially threatening new drugs and trends. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2009/02/15-year-conference_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0503	2008-12-11	UNK	Drug use, impaired driving and traffic accidents	 As Europeans prepare for the festive season, the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) releases today its latest report on drugs and driving. While alcohol remains the number one substance endangering lives on European roads, more drivers are now found to be using illicit drugs and psychoactive medicines, presenting a growing challenge for policy-makers. The report, Drug use, impaired driving and traffic accidents, a review of the latest research in this field, explores the potential impact on road safety (1). Concerns are expressed in the report over the prevalence of drivers under the influence of drugs on EU roads as well as the detection of a broader range of drugs. ‘The range of psychoactive substances available for illicit use today is widening’, says the report ‘and the latest studies which look for evidence of their use in drivers are indeed finding increased rates’. The report is dedicated to the effects and risks associated with the use of individual substances or with multiple drug use. Among the substances covered are amphetamines, cannabis and cocaine as well as a range of synthetic drugs (ecstasy, GHB, ketamine, PCP). Also included are opioids (buprenorphine, fentanyl, heroin, methadone and morphine) and benzodiazepines (e.g. sedatives). ‘Preventing driving under the influence of drugs is targeted by the current EU drugs strategy 2005–12 and its action plans’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz, ‘and policymakers are increasingly called upon to respond to the problems of road fatalities linked to licit and illicit substances. Determining the link between drug use, impaired driving and traffic accidents is a remarkably complex subject and a fast-moving area of research. With this report we aim to offer a precise overview of findings to date and an important signpost towards more effective solutions in the future’. Measuring prevalence Research covered in the report can be broadly split into two types: epidemiological and experimental. Epidemiological studies examine the prevalence of drugs in driving populations, and are conducted through a range of surveys (e.g. roadside, hospitals). In Europe, the United States, Australia and Canada, around 1 % to 2 % of drivers stopped during roadside surveys tested positive for drugs in saliva. Higher prevalence levels of 6 % to 12 % were found in studies using urine samples (2). Epidemiological studies assessing the prevalence of drugs, medicines and/or alcohol in drivers involved in atraffic accident (fatal or not) found that alcohol was more prevalent in this group than any other psychoactive substance. However, drugs were frequently found, and more often than in the general driving population.Cannabis and benzodiazepines generally compete for second place after alcohol.  Assessing risks Experimental studies, where a drug is administered to volunteers in measured doses, help gauge potential risks through performance tests (e.g. assessing reaction times, visual skills); driving simulator exercises (e.g. testing braking ability); and real driving ‘tests’ on the road (e.g. monitoring deviation, speed). According to the report, experimental studies show that most illicit drugs can affect some aspect of driving performance and increase the risk of being involved in a traffic accident. And chronic (long-term) use of any illicit drug can decrease driving performance, even when the subject is no longer intoxicated. Use of cannabis, GHB, ketamine and PCP was found to reduce the cognitive and psychomotor skills required to drive (e.g. motor control, perception, balance). Keeping a vehicle on track, for example, was the most difficult task for participants under the influence of cannabis due to the effects it has on body sway. When cannabis was combined with alcohol, the effects of both substances were prolonged and enhanced. Negative effects produced by ecstasy use (MDMA) included increases in speed and speed variance and poorer ability to follow a car. Studies on long-term use of cocaine showed that the drug has negative effects on attention, problem-solving and perceptions of speed. Risk of accident was also higher when cocaine was combined with another psychoactive substance, such as alcohol and/or cannabis. Severe impairment can be expected with use of heroin (e.g. poor reaction time, right-left discrimination and perception of time). The results of experimental studies also show obvious driving impairment with therapeutic drugs, whatever the class (benzodiazepines, antihistamines, antidepressants), although in all classes there are some that cause little or no impairment. Benzodiazepines generally have impairing effects, and often these are severe. Those on medication may be unaware of a drug’s effects on driving ability, underlining the need for those prescribing to take into account road safety issues and offer appropriate advice and guidance. Developing research, meeting targets At the start of the European road safety programme in 2003, it was estimated that over 40 000 people were dying on European roads every year, with alcohol responsible for around a quarter of these deaths. The programme set the ambitious target of halving the number of road deaths in Europe by the end of 2010 (3). The European Commission’s DRUID project (Driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs and medicines) provides scientific support to this policy target and is due to deliver results in 2010 (4). As part of an international expert group involving DRUID, the EMCDDA contributed in 2007 to guidelines for future research into drugs and driving aimed at standardising methods to allow for cross-country comparison globally (5).  Today’s report states that: ‘It is already clear that driving under the influence of illicit or medicinal drugs is not  uncommon and can cause a substantial risk to traffic safety’. It also illustrates how drug-testing procedures continue to suffer accuracy concerns. For example the EU’s roadside testing assessment project, Rosita, considered no device currently reliable enough to be recommended for use in EU countries, despite technological advances in this area (6). 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2008/drug-use-impaired-driving-and-traffic-accidents_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0506	2008-11-06	UNK	Director's speech on the occasion of the launch of the EMCDDA Annual Report 2008, Brussels	 Mr Chairman, Dear Colleagues on the panel, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am pleased to share with you some of our key findings on the state of the European drugs problem. Again this year, we offer you a detailed review of the latest situation in the 27 EU Member States… as well as information on Croatia, Norway and Turkey. When you read our report, I am sure that you will be impressed not only by the comprehensiveness of the data now available but also by the useful insights provided by a European level analysis. I must acknowledge, that I am privileged to work at the EMCDDA with a group of highly professional and dedicated staff, and it is their hard work, together with the considerable input and expertise we receive from our national partners – mainly in the Reitox network, that make this report possible. In our report this year, there are some positive elements, but I would be failing in my duty if I did not point out that we also face some serious challenges and problems. Let me start with positive messages: I can reinforce the statements I made here last year on trends in drug use in Europe. We have entered a relatively stable period in terms of drug use and drug-related harms. And in some important areas we see promising changes in young people’s attitudes towards drugs. At European level we continue to see signs of greater cohesion – and Europe has a stronger voice in the international debate on drugs. Inclusion is a key aspect of the European perspective and we have seen a growing recognition of the need to include Civil Society in the drugs debate – and I know the European Parliament has been active and influential in this respect. Nevertheless: drug use levels remain high by historical standards; some of the most problematic forms of use are clearly not diminishing; and in some areas, notably cocaine, we are still seeing increases in use. Let us now look at some specific aspects of drug use and the harm caused that we highlight in this year’s report. [Cannabis] I’ll start with cannabis… Nearly a quarter of all European adults (about 71 million), have used cannabis at least once… and the proportion among young males is particularly high. We are becoming more aware of health and social problems associated with cannabis use. We are particularly concerned about the estimated 4 million Europeans who use the drug on a daily basis… about the rises in the number of those treated for cannabis problems in Europe – as well as about the growing recognition that the use of this drug can cause problems. One positive development is that the data now strongly point to a decline in use – particularly in high prevalence countries and in younger age cohorts. Less positively – on the supply side – we do see more domestically produced herbal cannabis in parts of Europe. This change appears to have happened quickly and we have launched a study this year to better understand this phenomenon. We know that home-produced cannabis is often more potent, and that controlling home production is a more difficult challenge for law-enforcement services. [Heroin] Hardly fashionable, but opiates – and especially heroin – remain at the centre of the European drug problem. Again the available data point to a relatively stable situation. However, the slow improvements we have been seeing for some years now appear to have stalled. And current signs lead us to conclude that the situation is not getting better, and may even be getting worse in some aspects – clearly an important area for vigilance and preparedness. We cannot ignore the wider context here: global opium production has increased by one third resulting in more than 730 tons of heroin on the global market in 2007. In parallel, the number of heroin seizures increased in most reporting countries. And that is not taking into account the considerable increases we have seen in seizures in Turkey. There have also been regional findings all over Europe which show that – despite the very negative image of the drug – initiation to opioid use and injecting is still occurring. Given the slow recovery rate of those addicted to heroin, even a modest number of new recruits will ensure that the problem remains with us for the foreseeable future. A further concern reported from some countries is the misuse of synthetic opiates – either drugs that have been diverted from medicinal use, or manufactured illicitly. An example here is Fentanyl, which is considerably more potent than heroin. Using this drug can be particularly hazardous as illustrated by the localised epidemic in Estonia, which in 2006 reported more than 70 Fentanyl-related fatal poisonings. Despite these concerns, it is important to recognise that services for those with opiate problems have increased dramatically in Europe. Today substitution treatment is provided by virtually all EU Member States with around 600,000 cases treated each year. Provision is still not sufficient in all countries but we are now having an impact on the harms caused by this damaging drug. [Cocaine and stimulants] Some form of stimulant drug — such as amphetamines, ecstasy or cocaine — is the second most commonly consumed type of illicit substance in Europe today. Some 12 million Europeans have tried cocaine. Slightly fewer, 11 million have tried amphetamines and around 9.5 million ecstasy. New data show a somewhat divergent picture for stimulant use in Europe – with a stabilising or even declining trend in the use of amphetamines and ecstasy, contrasted with the increasing popularity and use of cocaine. There is a distinct regional separation of stimulant markets. In southern and western Europe cocaine is much more prevalent – while in middle, northern and eastern Europe amphetamines still dominate. This divide is reflected to some extent in seizures – with over two thirds of all cocaine seized in the EU intercepted in either Spain or Portugal. West Africa continues to grow in importance as a transit point for cocaine – and I think we have to be concerned about the collateral damage that this is bringing to countries in this region. [Harms caused] Now a few remarks on the harms caused by illicit drugs, which go far beyond dependence on a particular substance. In Europe, we estimate about 3 000 new cases of drug-related HIV infections every year. This figure may be low by historical comparison, yet it still represents a serious health problem. In most countries, over 40% of drug injectors are infected with hepatitis C. The long-term costs of treating this hidden health epidemic are going to be considerable. On top of this, we estimate that there are 7 000 to 8 000 drug-induced deaths in Europe every year. Drug overdose is one of the leading causes of death among young Europeans. In simple terms, one of our young citizens dies from a drug overdose every hour – an appalling waste of life. A couple of years ago we were optimistic that levels of drug-related deaths were falling – this appears to be no longer the case with countries reporting small increases. Although most drug-related deaths in Europe are linked to opioid use, around 450 deaths can be directly attributed to cocaine – a worrying development. We also cannot ignore the social harms associated with drug use. Much of the debate on cannabis at the moment is concerned with possible health problems – and rightly so. But I think it is equally important to look at the social and educational problems that can arise – particularly from intensive cannabis use among young people. [Research, innovation, best practice, Europe’s response] As already said, we have seen some stabilisation in drug use in Europe but if we are to make major inroads into this problem – it will be through more effective interventions and here innovation and research are critically important. I am pleased to report that there is growing discussion – supported by the European Commission – on the need for more European-based drugs research. We are all aware of the growing pressures on health budgets and the public purse. This is why we must make sure the money we spend on drug prevention and treatment is well targeted. Our new publication on vulnerable groups reports on what is being done in Europe to target those with a higher probability of developing a drugs problem. Innovation is by no means the prerogative of the health field. A new and innovative approach can be seen in the collaboration of national law enforcement agencies within the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre–Narcotics (MAOC-N), which is now playing a key role in fighting cocaine trafficking via the Atlantic – targeting the shipments of cocaine from South America to West Africa and Europe. A growing part of our work is keeping track of new ideas, concepts and how they can be successfully implemented. Our goal is to ensure that progress made in the different parts of the European Union can be easily shared. And in our report you will find a number of interesting examples of best practice in the drugs field. [Policy] Now an update on policy and international developments… 2008 has been a year of unprecedented reflection on European and global drug issues. The EU drugs action plan (2005–2008) has been evaluated and a new one has been drawn up to take us into 2012. Activities at European level are mirrored at national level and today nearly all Member States have national drug policy documents, structured in many cases along EU lines – a demonstration of a growing European consensus on drug policy issues. The international debate has been dominated by the progress review of the goals set at the 1998 UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS). The EU has put forward a strong and united position that is centred on a comprehensive, balanced and evidence-based approach. I think that one thing that the review has demonstrated is that by international comparison the European approach can be seen as both effective and humane. A de facto, yet flexible, European model has emerged that is very well perceived, not only within the EU but also worldwide. Finally , Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, In this report – as in all our reports – our mission is the same – to bring you an accurate and comprehensive review of what is known about the drugs problem in Europe and the measures being taken to tackle it. We are committed to being both impartial and scientifically rigorous in our work – this is not always easy in such an emotive field where so many have strongly held views. Nonetheless, the value of our work comes from its independence and I hope that when you look at our report and the accompanying statistics on our website… they will allow you to gain more insight into the complex nature of the drugs problem we face in Europe. Thank you very much for your attention, I welcome any questions you may have. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2008/directors-speech-occasion-launch-emcdda-annual-report-2008-brussels_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0519	2008-03-03	UNK	New drug BZP to be placed under control across the EU	 Europe has responded today to concerns over the use of the stimulant drug BZP by subjecting it to ‘control measures and criminal provisions’ across the EU Member States. The decision of the Council of the EU (1) was adopted today in the final stage of a three-step procedure designed to respond to potentially threatening new psychoactive drugs in the EU (2). The Council Decision is based on the findings of a formal risk-assessment report on BZP produced in 2007 by the Scientific Committee of the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA), with participation of additional experts from the European Commission, Europol and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) (3). The report, submitted to the European Commission and Council of the EU on 31 May 2007, examined the health and social risks of the drug as well as information on international trafficking and the involvement of organised crime. The Council Decision states that: ‘due to its stimulant properties, risk to health, the lack of medical benefits and following the precautionary principle, there is a need to control BZP’, through measures ‘appropriate to the relatively low risks of the substance’. EU Member States are thus called on today to take, within one year, the necessary measures to submit BZP to: ‘control measures proportionate to the risks of the substance’ and ‘criminal penalities’ in line with their national laws (which in turn comply with the UN drug conventions). Eight EU Member States (Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Malta and Sweden) already control BZP under drug control or equivalent legislation and two (Spain and the Netherlands) regulate it under their medicine-related legislation. BZP (1-benzylpiperazine) is a psychoactive drug belonging to the group of piperazine derivatives, which includes substances such as mCPP and TFMPP. Like amphetamine and methamphetamine, BZP is a central nervous system stimulant and is reported by users to provoke similar effects to these substances, although it is less potent (around 10% of that of d-amphetamine). Whereas the parent compound piperazine has been widely used for many years as an anti-worming drug in animals, BZP has never been used for such a purpose. Health risks or adverse reactions reported by BZP users include: vomiting, headaches, stomach pains/nausea, anxiety, insomnia, mood swings and confusion — with certain symptoms sometimes lasting for up to 24 hours. Clinical reports on BZP patients have suggested links between use of the drug and grand mal seizures, although this finding is based on a very small number of cases. BZP has also been found in some post-mortem samples, but the extent to which the drug was implicated in the deaths is unknown as other substances or circumstances were also involved. BZP was first notified to the EMCDDA and Europol via their early-warning system on new drugs in 1999, but there was an increase in the number of notifications of BZP to the agencies at the end of 2006. Over the last two years, BZP-containing products have been aggressively marketed by various retailers and websites as ‘natural’ or ‘herbal’ highs and as a legal alternative to ecstasy (‘Legal E’, ‘Legal X’) (4), misleading potential users to believe the drug is safe. Many BZP tablets and capsules contain TFMPP, the combination of the two substances mimicking some of the effects of ecstasy.  To date, 15 EU Member States and non-member Norway have reported to Europol and/or the EMCDDA seizures of BZP in powder, capsule or tablet form, ranging from small seizures (Belgium and Greece) to up to 64,900 tablets (UK). The risk-assessment report revealed little information on large-scale synthesis, processing or distribution of BZP or on the involvement of organised crime. This may be explained by the fact that, in the countries where it has not been subject to legal controls, there has been no need for illicit production as it has been available from retail chemical suppliers. BZP has no established or acknowledged medical value and there are no known licensed medicinal products containing the substance in the EU. Today’s Council Decision states that placing the drug under control in the EU Member States may help avoid problems in international law enforcement and judicial cooperation. BZP is currently not under assessment by the UN drug control system.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2008/bzp-be-placed-under-control_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0521	2008-01-23	UNK	EMCDDA and ESPAD seal cooperation framework	 The EMCDDA and the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) will be working together more closely in future thanks to a cooperation framework recently agreed by the two bodies. The cooperation framework, established through a formal exchange of letters at the end of 2007 between the EMCDDA Director and the ESPAD Coordinator, sets out an eight-point list of areas for collaboration. Included in the list are: integration of the ESPAD approach into the broader data-collection system at EU level; encouragement of countries’ participation in ESPAD surveys; and analytical exploitation of ESPAD data, by placing them in the context of EMCDDA data and through contact between ESPAD experts and those working with the EMCDDA. Cooperation has existed on an ad hoc basis between the EMCDDA and ESPAD since the mid-1990s and ESPAD data have been regularly included in the EMCDDA’s annual reporting on the drug situation in Europe. These data have provided crucial information on substance use among 15–16 year-old students, allowing trends over time to be assessed. In the exchange of letters, the EMCDDA and ESPAD agree that it is in their mutual interest to: facilitate the exchange of information and expertise; improve the availability, quality and comparability of school survey data; and gain maximum analytical insight from data available in this area. The new agreement enables the organisations to carry out joint projects in line with priorities set out in their respective work programmes. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2008/emcdda-espad-cooperation-framework_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0530	2007-06-25	UNK	EU calls for 'common language' to describe drug-related crime	 Ensuring a high level of security for the general public is prominent on the European policy agenda and stepping up work to prevent drug-related crime is one of the key goals of the current EU drugs action plan (2005–2008). But, before countries can measure the extent of such crime, or assess the impact of measures to counter it, they must first agree on a common language to describe the problem. This issue is taken up by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in the latest edition of its policy briefing Drugs in focus, released on International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking (26 June). EMCDDA Chairman Marcel Reimen comments: ‘Adopting a clear definition of drug-related crime is an essential first step if we are to develop the methodologies needed to assess, not only the true extent of this problem, but also the impact of our policies and actions.’ The year 2007 is the deadline set by the drugs action plan for presenting a common European definition of ‘drug-related crime’. The European Commission is expected to propose such a definition to the Council of the EU at the end of this year based on studies brought forward by the EMCDDA. Today’s briefing, one of the resources to be submitted to the Commission, puts forward elements for a definition of ‘drug-related crime’ encompassing four categories: psychopharmacological crimes — committed under the influence of a psychoactive substance; economic–compulsive crimes — committed to obtain money (or drugs) to support drug use; systemic crimes — committed within the functioning of illicit drug markets (as part of the business of drug supply, distribution and use); drug law offences — committed in violation of drug laws (and other related) legislations. At present, routine data in the EU are only collected on the last type of crime and even then are gathered through very different reporting practices. Data on the first three types of crime are rare or patchy, usually gathered through ad hoc local studies. EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz says: ‘In the same way that we have developed common European methods to monitor and describe other aspects of the drug problem — such as drug-related deaths — we must now turn to developing reliable instruments to assess the extent of, and trends in, drug-related crime. Agreeing on a common conceptual framework to describe the problem and to explore the relationship between drugs and crime will give us the foundation we need to talk with confidence in future about this complex phenomenon’. Drug law offences increased in the majority of the EU Member States in the period 2000–2005. The proportion of those involving cocaine in particular rose over the same five-year period. International day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking is designed to underline the international nature of the drugs problem. The theme chosen by the UN to mark the occasion this year is ‘Do drugs control your life?’ (2). With the slogan ‘Your life. Your community. No place for drugs’, we are invited to reflect on the impact of illicit drugs, not only on those using them, but also on the wider society in which we live. Wolfgang Götz says: ‘Sadly today, drugs affect all our communities, both at home in Europe and way beyond its borders. Responding to problems caused by the production, trafficking and use of drugs is a challenge and a responsibility we all share, whether we are working at international or local level’. The EMCDDA will mark this International day with an awareness-raising event for the Lisbon diplomatic community and its partners from the Portuguese authorities. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) will be launching its 2007 World Drug Report. Portuguese drug coordinator and President of the Instituto da Droga e da Toxicodependência (IDT), Dr João Goulão visits the EMCDDA on 25 June to give a presentation to staff on the forthcoming events in the field of drugs planned for the Portuguese Presidency of the EU which begins this Sunday. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2007/eu-calls-common-language-describe-drug-related-crime_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0531	2007-06-07	UNK	Magic mushroom business presents law-makers with dilemmas	 ‘Hallucinogenic mushrooms were among the first psychoactive substances consumed by man. But today they present us with a new dilemma’, says EMCDDA Director Wolfgang Götz in the latest edition in the agency’s policy briefing series Drugs in focus out today. Entitled Hallucinogenic mushrooms: the challenge of responding to naturally occurring substances in an electronic age, the briefing raises questions such as: ‘How to effectively regulate such a complex group of naturally occurring products?’ ‘How to apply controls when they are promoted and sold globally via the Internet?’ and ‘What can be done when regulatory actions may simply result in suppliers switching to alternative and possibly even more damaging products?’ Hallucinogenic mushrooms (commonly known as ‘magic mushrooms’) grow wild in many parts of Europe, but the information available suggests that most of those used for their psychoactive properties are cultivated. Naturally occurring hallucinogens (1) can be found in over 100 species of mushroom, most of which contain psilocybin and psilocin (or psilotsin) as the main active ingredients responsible for the hallucinogenic effect. Although these two active ingredients are controlled under the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, some countries were initially unsure how to classify mushrooms containing these agents. This confusion has been exploited by retailers and has thwarted efforts to control supply. Recent changes in legislation Since 2001, six EU countries have tightened controls on psilocybin- or psilocin-containing mushrooms in response to concerns regarding prevalence of use: Denmark (2001), the Netherlands (2002), Germany, Estonia, UK (2005) and Ireland (2006). But law-making on this topic has been complicated. Legislators in Ireland and the UK for example, not wishing to unjustly prosecute those on whose land such mushrooms grow wild, outlawed them when ‘treated or prepared’ (indicating intent of use). Similarly, in the Netherlands, these mushrooms were placed under control when ‘dried or processed’. However, such legal loopholes led to ‘smart shops’ simply selling the fresh variety. The UK changed its legislation in 2005 and now controls psilocybin- or psilocin-containing mushrooms with no mention of their state. On the premise that a mushroom is not strictly a ‘plant’, the German law was amended in 2005 to prohibit the cultivation or sale of ‘organic’ substances from which narcotic substances can be extracted, thus closing any possible loophole for fungi. In some countries, stricter legislation is helping to prevent diffusion of the trend. Reports in the UK, for example, suggest it has had an impact on the availability of this variety of mushroom and the overall volume of Internet sales. But these new controls may only be partially effective as retailers switch to the sale of legal alternatives such as some species of Amanita mushrooms (e.g. Amanita muscaria/’fly agaric’ and Amanita pantherina), which can be more toxic than the psilocybin- or psilocin-containing variety and can cause fatal poisoning. Today’s briefing states that: ‘Although strengthening legal control measures may be an approach to limiting the use and availability of hallucinogenic mushrooms, the impact of any measures needs to be carefully monitored both to assess their effectiveness and to avoid the risk of unintended negative consequences.’ Health risks and prevention The number of fatal and non-fatal emergencies related to the use of psilocybin- or psilocin-containing mushrooms use is very low. Generally physical effects are short-lived and not significant (e.g. dizziness, nausea, shivering), although more pronounced symptoms have also been recorded (e.g. severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting). Users tend to contact emergency services due to mental health effects such as ‘bad trips’. In such cases, intoxicated individuals are usually severely agitated, confused and disoriented, with impaired concentration and judgment. In serious cases, acute psychotic episodes may occur, including severe paranoia and total loss of reality, which may lead to accidents, self-injury or suicide attempts. User accounts of unpredictable potency, bad taste and negative effects may all contribute to limiting their recreational or repeated use. Drug prevention programmes often provide information on hallucinogenic drugs alongside other drug information but, as yet, there appears to be a gap in the provision of prevention materials relating exclusively to magic mushroom use and similarly in materials available for professionals working with young people. On this note, the briefing states that: ‘The Internet allows increasing opportunities for promoting and selling hallucinogenic mushrooms, but also for providing information about health risks’. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2007/magic-mushroom-business-presents-law-makers-dilemmas_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0559	2005-10-20	UNK	 EMCDDA and Europol step up cooperation on drugs and crime	 The EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) and the European law enforcement organisation, Europol, are set to step up cooperation on drugs and crime following a meeting between the two bodies in Lisbon today. At a special signing ceremony at the drugs agency, Director s Max-Peter Ratzel (Europol) and Wolfgang Götz (EMCDDA) gave their seal of approval on a document reaffirming their commitment to strengthening action against illicit drugs and crime in the European Union through effective collaboration. The latest document, which build on an existing ‘Cooperation agreement’ signed by the two bodies on 19 November 2001, was drawn up in the context of recent developments at EU level, including EU enlargement and increased public awareness of the importance of international cooperation on the above issues. The document specifies that, in particular, the agencies should join forces in the following areas: evaluation of the European Union drugs strategy and action plans (e.g. via contributions to various European Commission reports and assessments); implementation of the May 2005 Council decision on information exchange, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances (e.g. the drafting of risk assessment reports on new substances entering the drug scene); and exchange of strategic information of mutual relevance (e.g. on topics such as drug seizures, money laundering, drug prices and purity). Additional areas of common interest for cooperation may also be explored . Annexed to the document is a list of concrete actions to be taken by the organisations until 2008. The document stipulates that a joint report of activities be drawn up annually to convey progress. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2005/joint-agreement-signed-lisbon_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0563	2005-05-10	UNK	New legal instrument on psychoactive substances	 The Council of the European Union has approved a legal instrument today that broadens the scope of EU action on new substances appearing on the drug scene in the Member States. The ‘Council decision on information exchange, risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances’ (1), developed under the Italian, Irish and Dutch presidencies in 2003 and 2004, replaces the 1997 Joint action (2), which was devoted exclusively to new synthetic drugs. As its name suggests, the new instrument maintains the three-step procedure of the Joint action. Today’s decision allows the EU to now act on all new psychoactive substances (narcotic, psychotropic) which appear in the Member States and which may pose similar health or social risks to those listed in the Schedules to the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The instrument not only covers a wider range of substances than before but also promises fast and more transparent results. According to the text: ‘The introduction of deadlines into every phase of the procedure established by this Decision should guarantee that the instrument can react swiftly and enhances its ability to provide a quick-response mechanism‘. On transparency, the EMCDDA and Europol are required to report annually to the Council, Parliament and the Commission on ‘the efficacy and achievements of the system’. Another innovation of the new instrument is that, unlike the Joint action, it also provides for the collection and exchange (but not control) of information on medicinal products diverted from their legitimate use. Here the London-based European Medicines Agency (EMEA) is set to play a more active role by assessing with the European Commission, and in close cooperation with the EMCDDA, the need for further action on these products. This Council decision has its roots in the last EU action plan on drugs (2000–2004), which called on the European Commission to launch an external evaluation of the 1997 Joint action. The results of this evaluation (2002) showed that the instrument had largely fulfilled the expectations of the Member States and the EU institutions – particularly as regards the early-warning system – but required reinforcement and re-orientation. Specifically the evaluation called for greater transparency and clarification of the Joint action’s procedures and definitions and for an assessment of its scope. As was the case under the Joint action, the EMCDDA and Europol will continue to be key players in implementing this new instrument, particularly in exchanging information through an early-warning system. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2005/new-legal-instrument-psychoactive-substances_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0566	2005-03-08	UNK	Male and female drug use: is the gap narrowing?	 Gender differences in patterns of drug use are addressed today by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in a technical paper marking International Women’s Day. According to the paper, men in the EU are still more likely than women to use illicit drugs. But there are concerns around possible signs of a ‘narrowing of the gap’ between male and female drug use, and greater similarities in lifetime drug-taking experience, particularly among school students. The paper analyses data from three sources: ESPAD school surveys (1995, 1999, 2003); general population surveys; and drug treatment centres. The paper says: ‘If young females are increasingly likely to experiment with drugs in the same manner as their male counterparts, this is indicative of a move towards more similar drug-taking patterns between the sexes in the future’. In time this could also mean a ‘considerable increase in overall prevalence levels’. The EMCDDA will be addressing the topic of gender in its 2006 Annual report. Today’s paper forms part of the preparatory process, aiming to stimulate debate among researchers on the influence of gender on drug use trends across Europe. ‘Young women in Europe may be increasingly vulnerable to using drugs and to consuming harmful levels of alcohol’, says Professor Salme Ahlström, Chairwoman of the EMCDDA Scientific Committee. ‘We need to throw more light on why this is so, in order to develop gender-sensitive prevention and treatment approaches that will engage young women and alter their behaviour. Such measures are essential if we are to avoid increased public health problems in the future’. Factors likely to influence gender differences in drug use and treatment attendance are described in the paper and include: drug type; age group; and patterns of drug use. On the latter, the paper reveals that among all adults (15–64 years) ‘predominance of males over females increases as the observation time frame is shortened from lifetime use, through recent use (last 12 months), to current use (last 30 days)’. Males are also more likely to report intensive drug use than females – in some countries, male school students are twice, three times and, in one country, even four times as prevalent as females in the ‘frequent cannabis use’ group (40 or more times in a lifetime). Other contributing factors, says the EMCDDA, may include dynamic forces determining trends across Europe, such as drug availability, disposable income and lifestyle fashions. Key findings Key findings outlined in today’s report include: Drug type Women outnumber males in the use of hypnotic and sedative drugs. In surveys of school students (15–16 years) in the EU, more females reported using tranquillisers and sedatives without a doctor’s prescription than males, except in Cyprus, Ireland, Norway and the UK. Among school students, males have greater current experience of drinking ‘five or more alcoholic drinks in one session’ (last 30 days) than females, except in Ireland, the UK and Norway. In general, male predominance is lower in those countries where prevalence of this drinking behaviour is highest. More male school students report lifetime experience of cannabis than their female counterparts, except in Ireland, Finland and Norway. Among school students in the EU, male to female ratios for lifetime cannabis use are quite similar to those for drinking ‘five or more alcoholic drinks in one session’. This may suggest a common association of these behaviours with an outgoing lifestyle. The number of females in relation to males tends to rise as prevalence of lifetime cannabis use increases. The predominance of males over females for recent, current and frequent cannabis use is higher than for lifetime cannabis use. Country variations in the gender ratio are more marked for lifetime experience of ecstasy than for cannabis. This applies to students (15–16 years) and adults (15–64 years) alike. Age group and patterns of use Increases in drug use among 15- to 16-year-old males are usually accompanied by increases among females. However increases among males tend to occur earlier or more rapidly. Lifetime prevalence of cannabis and ecstasy use among female school students (15–16 years) is closer to that of their male counterparts than is the case between male and female adults aged 15–64. Treatment data Data provided by drug treatment services in the EU show that male clients far outnumber female clients. Only around 20% of clients in treatment are women. Around 90% of clients referred to treatment centres by the criminal justice system are male. In recent years, the proportion of females attending drug treatment services has increased in most EU countries. The highest increases were in Germany, Greece and the Netherlands. Male to female ratios among those in drug treatment in the EU vary considerably by country. InCyprus, for example, men attending drug treatment services outnumber women by 9:1. Meanwhile, inHungary, at the lowest end of the range, the male to female ratio is 1.6: 1. Most of the care provided by drug treatment services is for opiate, cocaine and cannabis problems, for which male clients far outnumber females. The proportion of females among clients in drug treatment is highest among young clients (under 20 years) with problems relating to amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) and among older clients (over 39 years) with problems resulting from the use of hypnotic and sedative (pharmaceutical) drugs. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2005/male-and-female-drug-use-gap-narrowing_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0568	2005-01-12	UNK	Co-morbidity: drug use and mental disorders	 Between 50% and 90% of drug users are reported to suffer from personality disorders and around one-fifth (15–20%) from more serious psychotic complaints. Yet mental disorders related to addiction are far less recognised than other factors associated with drug use, such as infectious diseases and social problems. These issues are highlighted by the EU drugs agency (EMCDDA) in the latest edition in its Drugs in focus series out today entitled ‘Co-morbidity – drug use and mental disorders’ (1). The release of the briefing coincides with the opening in Helsinki today of a major World Health OrganisationEuropean Ministerial Conference on Mental Health: Facing the challenges, building solutions. The EMCDDAand the WHO have been collaborating over the last year to raise awareness of the hidden problem of co- morbidity in Europe. Recent studies have revealed suicide attempts in around 50% of co-morbid patients. But both drug treatment services and psychiatric teams regularly fail to spot patients with co-morbidity. One explanation is that the condition is notoriously difficult to diagnose. Drug addiction and disruptive behaviour often mask genuine personality disorders and psychiatric syndromes are often mistaken for substance-induced states. A further obstacle is lack of training, says the EMCDDA. Psychiatric and drug treatment professionals, while highly specialised in their own field (medicine, psychology, social work, etc.), are generally ill-equipped to cope with co-morbidity and the totality of clients’ problems. As a result, patients are often shuttled between psychiatric and drug services (‘revolving door’ patients), which disrupts their treatment and increases drop-out rates. Troublesome and aggressive patients are difficult to manage and can provoke frustration and high turnover rates among treatment staff. An integration of services and professions, case supervision and practical training, says the briefing, might be ‘the most powerful antidote’ to staff burnout. EMCDDA Chairman Marcel Reimen says: ‘Cooperation and coordination between services at all points in the treatment chain is essential for the successful treatment of co-morbidity and for ensuring a continuum of care and aftercare. Treatment is effective if highly structured, integrating multi-professional teams, and customised via individual case-management. This is both time-consuming and demanding on human and organisational resources but in the end is cost-effective’. Psychiatric disorders are generally chronic conditions that require long-term treatment, concludes the briefing. ‘Aftercare and social reintegration efforts are important in order to avoid relapse and renewed need for cost- intensive care’. Co-morbidity is defined by the WHO as the ‘co-occurrence in the same individual of a psychoactive use disorder and another psychiatric disorder’.

EMCDDA_UNK_0584	2004-02-04	UNK	Hepatitis C — the 'hidden epidemic'	 ‘A hidden epidemic’ and ‘a major challenge to public health’ – this is how the EU drugs agency, the Lisbon-based EMCDDA, describes hepatitis C in the latest edition of its Drugs in focus series, out today. The agency says that over the past few years hepatitis C has emerged as a major threat to public health worldwide. Within the EU the total number of infected people is unknown but ‘probably over one million and possibly up to several millions’. Agency chief Georges Estievenart says it’s a threat European policy-makers can’t afford to ignore. ‘The implications of inaction for EU public health budgets are likely to be considerable. It is better to provide screening, prevention education and treatment now than to let the disease spread and to wait until sufferers become chronically ill. In this field the principle of precaution is a “must”.’ Entitled Hepatitis C: A hidden epidemic. A major challenge to public health, today’s document aims to focus the attention of EU policy-makers on the key issues surrounding this challenging area of European public health. On a positive note, the agency records that, since the introduction of screening of blood and blood products for hepatitis C, transmission of the virus has been ‘dramatically reduced’. Injecting drug users are now the group at greatest risk of infection, accounting for up to 60-90% of new infections. It declares: ‘Health-promotion activities are needed to discourage people from injecting drugs or to change their behaviour to reduce the risk of contracting the virus if they are unable to stop. Hepatitis C is a highly infectious and potentially fatal disease that attacks the liver. Yet people who have contracted the virus often remain symptom-free for many years and most cases are undiagnosed. Public and professional awareness of the disease needs to be raised to encourage people at risk to come forward for testing and referral for treatment where it is appropriate.’ In a reference to the drugs challenge posed by imminent EU enlargement, the agency states: ‘Young and new injectors are at high risk of contracting hepatitis C shortly after they begin injecting. Wherever injecting drug use is likely to increase, such as some of the new EU Member States, new epidemics of hepatitis C are likely to emerge.’ The key issues So, what are the key issues for EU policy-makers to focus on in attempting to tackle this major public health threat? Marcel Reimen, Chairman of the EMCDDA Management Board, stated: ‘The key to effective prevention is to reduce the number of people who start to inject drugs and to influence the behaviour of young and new injectors. To achieve this we need to raise awareness of hepatitis C amongst professionals, drug users and the wider public.’ More formally, the briefing document lists the policy priorities thus: It is important that policy-makers acknowledge the future impact of hepatitis C infection and place prevention and treatment of the disease high on the policy agenda. All EU States face escalating costs due to the hidden HCV epidemic. Each year of delay in preventing new HCV infections in the EU may lead to an increase in treatment costs of an additional 1.4 billion euros. The risk of transmission of HCV can be reduced through measures to alter high-risk behaviour such as sharing needles and other injecting equipment, as well as through action to reduce injecting drug use. There is a short window of opportunity for prevention with young and new injectors. It is vital that interventions are targeted at this group, and at new populations where drug injecting may be spreading, including in the new member states. Improved screening and monitoring systems for hepatitis C infection would help ensure that people needing treatment for HCV are identified early. They would also enable both trends in HCV infection and the effectiveness of preventative strategies to be monitored. There is a need to review treatment guidelines for hepatitis C and to develop strategies for interdisciplinary cooperation between hepatologists and addiction specialists to include drug users in treatment. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2004/hepatitis-c-%E2%80%94-hidden-epidemic_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0585	2003-12-05	UNK	Four more synthetic drugs under EU control	 The Council of the European Union has adopted on 27 November and published today  (JO/L321) a Decision defining four new synthetic drugs as substances to be placed under control measures and criminal penalties in the EU Member States. The four drugs are 2C-I (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine),  2C-T-2 (2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthiophenethylamine),  2C-T-7 (2,5-dimethoxy-4-(n) propylthiophenethylamine), and TMA-2 (2,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine). The decision, taken within the framework of the 1997 Joint action on new synthetic drugs, stems from concerns about health and social risks of the drug, presented in risk assessment reports produced by the scientific committee of the Lisbon-based EU drugs agency EMCDDA, together with experts nominated by the Member States and representatives of the European Commission, Europol and the EMEA.  The drugs 2C-I, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7 and TMA-2 are amphetamine derivatives and have hallucinogenic and stimulant properties.  Although there have been no reported cases within the EU of death or poisoning due to the drugs, they are believed to carry similar risks to other hallucinogenic drugs which are already listed under the Schedules 1971 of the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. All four drugs have already been detected in Member States and there has been one reported case of international trafficking of the drug 2C-T-2 within the EU. Laboratories involved in the production of the drugs have been seized in three Member States.  2C-I, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7 and TMA-2 have no medical or industrial use and are already controlled in several Member States.   Following the publication of the Decision in the Official Journal of the European Union, and in line with their national laws, EU Member States have up to three months to introduce measures to control the four drugs, in compliance with their obligations under the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances.   This Council Decision confirms the effectiveness of the early-warning and risk-assessment mechanism provided for under the 1997 Joint action. The Commission is currently consulting the Council and European Parliament on its proposal for a new Council Decision to extend and reinforce the Joint action’s capacity.  Four new synthetic drugs (2C-I, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7 and TMA-2) were singled out by the Council of the EU for risk assessment in December 2002. The decision followed consideration by the Council's Horizontal working party on drugs (HWPD) of an EMCDDA–Europol report providing the state of knowledge on these substances.   The meeting to assess the risks of 2C-I, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7 and TMA-2 was convened under the auspices of  Scientific Committee of the EMCDDA, extended with experts nominated by the Member States and representatives of the European Commission, Europol and the EMEA, and was held on 31 March and 1 April 2003 at the Centre's headquarters in Lisbon. The meeting produced formal reports on the risk assessments, which were adopted the same day. As foreseen in the Joint action, the reports were submitted without delay to the European Commission and to the Greek Presidency of the Horizontal working party on drugs of the Council of the EU for further action.    	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2003/four-more-synthetic-drugs-under-eu-control_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0597	2003-06-25	UNK	Treatment database provides new understanding of drug problem	 Scientists from over 20 countries in Europe and worldwide met at the EU drugs agency in Lisbon this week for their annual meeting to examine the profiles and characteristics of people seeking treatment for drug problems. Information of this kind is collected via the EMCDDA’s ‘treatment demand indicator’, one of the agency’s longest established and most comprehensive tools for monitoring the drug problem. Knowing more about who is seeking treatment for drugs, and where, is a crucial measure of trends and prevalence in problem drug use. It also allows countries to assess the potential future need for drug treatment services. And, by studying how demands for treatment are affected by drug epidemics, statistical modelling (mathematical) techniques increasingly offer the potential to track new and emerging ones. ‘Data is now available from over 150,000 people across Europe demanding treatment every year for drug problems’, says Georges Estievenart, Executive Director of the EMCDDA. ‘ This provides us with a powerful tool for planning responses as it helps us to understand the individual characteristics of these drug users, their drugs of choice and patterns of drug use – this is essential information’. The significance of data on treatment demand is also attracting increasing international attention. This week’s meeting provided a forum for European scientists to meet with their counterparts from the UN, Canada and the US, to focus on how best to improve the quality of data gathered in this area, share experiences and identify common trends in the global problem. It was also the first time that the new EU acceding countries, many of which have serious and developing drug problems, had the opportunity to join the EU treatment demand expert group. The meeting concluded with an agreement on: ways to further develop and harmonise treatment data-collection mechanisms; the need to further analyse data by applying statistical techniques; ways to work together to identify and explain important emerging trends in problem drug use; and a new project to develop a better understanding of the rising demands for treatment for cannabis- related problems. Drug treatment demand in Europe Heroin remains the drug at the centre of most treatment interventions. The proportion of European heroin users who are injecting has fallen, as heroin smoking has gained in popularity. But a worrying trend is that a few countries report in their new data some increased new injecting. Recent data show, in many European countries, a rise in clients demanding treatment for cannabis-related problems. A number of factors may play a role here, such as the introduction of new treatment facilities aimed at young people; a possible increase in treatment referrals from criminal justice agencies; and changes in patterns of cannabis use, possibly including more intensive use in some groups. The EMCDDA has launched an analytical study to better understand this issue. In some areas, demand for cocaine treatment also appears to be on the rise, although servi ces for stimulant users are often less well-developed and the number of cocaine users in treatment overall remains low. A common language Improving access to drug treatment in the EU Member States is one of the six targets of the EU action plan on drugs (2000–2004). Specifically it stresses the need ‘to increase substantially the number of successfully treated addicts’. The EMCDDA’s treatment demand indicator is one of five of the agency’s key indicators (see notes) allowing drug data to be collected in a uniform way across the EU. The indicators have been endorsed as the foundation of a Europe-wide databank to allow new trends and developments in drug problems to be identified and to provide a sound evidence base for policy-making and action. The instruments offer countries a set of common tools on which to base drug-related policy and to facilitate a European level dialogue on the drug problem. Commenting on the meeting, EMCDDA Management Board Chairman, Marcel Reimen said: ‘Increasingly we have an understanding of Europe’s drug problem through the five EMCDDA indicators. These provide us not only with a common language for interpreting the nature of our shared problem, but also offer an important tool to assist Member States in developing common responses.’ 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2003/treatment-database-provides-new-understanding-drug-problem_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0603	2002-12-13	UNK	Council calls for risk assessment of four new synthetic drugs	 Four new synthetic drugs were singled out by the Council of the EU for risk assessment this week under the 1997 Joint action on new synthetic drugs. The decision follows consideration by the Councilís Horizontal working party on drugs (HWPD), on 12 December, of an EMCDDAñ Europol report providing the state of knowledge on these substances. The four substances are: 2C-I (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodo-phenethylamine) 2C-T-2 (4-ethylthio-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine) 2C-T-7 (2,5-dimethoxy-4-(n)-propylthiophenethylamine) TMA-2 (2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylisopropylamine) Three of the drugs belong to the so-called '2C' family and are from the phenethylamine chemical group. All provoke hallucinogenic and other effects such as mood-lifting, sense of well-being and powerful visual alterations. The substances tend to be taken in doses ranging from 10ñ35 mg, thus being stronger than ecstasy (MDMA) which is typically taken in 80 mg doses. Health risks posed by the 2C drugs partly derive from their dose-sensitivity. The delayed action of 2C-I for example (onset of effects in 90 minutes) could potentially lead users to take too much of the drug if they become impatient and ëtop upí their dose before effects hit. Sniffing 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7 in powder form increases the risks of severe and even lethal overdoses. TMA-2 is from the trimethoxy amphetamine group. It too has potent hallucinogenic effects and is around 10 times stronger than mescaline. Health risks derive from the thin line between the dose needed to produce psychoactive effects and a toxic dose. Among the side effects of the four drugs are: nausea, vomiting, delirium, dissociation, loss of memory, panic attacks and a strong depression of the central nervous system, which could provoke convulsions, suffocation or lead to physical injury. Although no fatalities related to these drugs have been recorded so far in the EU, seizures of all four have been reported recently in a number of Member States, leading some countries to already place them under control (see annex). Deaths related to 2C-T-7 have been recorded in the US, where it is now controlled. The EMCDDA will now prepare for a formal risk assessment of the health and social risks of these substances, as well as the possible consequences of prohibition. Final risk-assessment conclusions will be forwarded to the European Commission and the Council in the course of 2003, based on scientific evidence. Previous risk-assessments by the EMCDDA and its partners have been undertaken for: MBDB, 4-MTA, GHB, ketamine and PMMA.

EMCDDA_UNK_0609	2002-07-19	UNK	Drug injecting has a disproportionate impact on public health	 Drug injecting is rare and stigmatised by the public and, on the whole, by drug users themselves. But, despite this, it accounts for most of the severe health consequences of drug use in Europe today. So says the EU drugs agency, the EMCDDA, in the latest edition of its Drugs in focus series out today. Entitled ‘Drug injecting challenges public health policy’, this briefing aimed at EU policy-makers examines some of the current trends in drug injecting and associated policy responses. It says many interventions employed to reduce it reflect the rapid evolution in policy perspectives and public opinion in many parts of Europe over the last 10 years – particularly the increasing acceptance of harm- reduction measures as integral to comprehensive public health policy on drugs. ‘Certain aspects of this approach are more controversial than others’, the briefing explains. ‘Some are experimental or still to be evaluated, while others are firmly established and evidence based.’ It adds that much of the responsibility for reducing drug-related health damage lies locally. So it is hoped that this briefing will be of particular interest to local decision-makers and service-providers, as well as policy-makers at national and European level. The message from the briefing is clear: EU Member States must act to reduce the public health consequences of drug injecting. ‘No easy task’ In the briefing, Mike Trace, Chairman of the EMCDDA Management Board, says: ‘Studying drug injecting is no easy task, largely due to its hidden nature and low prevalence in the general population. Why and how people decide to engage in such dangerous behaviour is difficult for most of us to understand. But we must understand it and respond with effective education and prevention measures.’ The agency says there are probably between half and one million drug injectors in the EU today, excluding those who inject occasionally or who have injected in the past. This represents less than 0.4% of the population aged 15-64, and no more than 5% of the estimated 18 million who use illegal drugs each year. However, it is associated closely with marginality and stigma – concentrated in communities with high levels of social deprivation, and in individuals with multiple problems of physical and mental health and social and personal behaviour. The need to understand and study the phenomenon are underscored in the briefing by Georges Estievenart, EMCDDA Director, who says: ‘Drug injecting spread very quickly in western countries in the 1970s and 1980s, and now seems to be extending rapidly in other regions of the world. But in the 1990s, some western countries reported falls in injecting. This may imply room for improvement and intervention – if the nature of such changes can be understood.’ The challenges for policy-makers Today’s briefing says reducing drug-related health damage is a priority for public health policy – and a key target of the EU drugs strategy 2000-04. It says the following issues need to be addressed by policy-makers: Though rare, drug injecting has a major public health impact, is closely linked to marginalisation, and despite decreases in some countries, is increasing in others. Drug injecting underlies most cases of HIV, hepatitis and overdose death among drug users in Europe. Public health policies to reduce health damage must therefore give top priority to reducing injecting and related risks. Continued drug injecting and risky behaviour, and renewed rises in overdoses and drug-related infectious diseases in some countries, indicate the need for greater efforts to reduce injecting and risk among drug injectors. These efforts must be based on evidence and on understanding the realities of local drug-use patterns. Interventions must be part of a comprehensive public health approach that addresses broad issues of social exclusion as well as balancing local needs. A range of responses adapted to local circumstances has been found useful to reduce transmission of infectious diseases. These include outreach and information, needle exchange, substitution treatment and, more controversially, injection rooms. Evidence suggests such responses do not increase drug use or drug-injecting, as some fear. Drug injecting substantially increases the risk of overdose – especially after release from prison and among the most marginalised people. Some, perhaps many overdoses are preventable. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2002/drug-injecting-has-disproportionate-impact-public-health_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0614	2002-03-05	UNK	Council decides PMMA should be placed under control	 The Council of the European Union adopted a unanimous decision on 28 February defining the new synthetic drug PMMA (para-methoxymethylamphetamine) as a substance to be placed under control measures and criminal penalties in the EU Member States. The decision, taken in the framework of the 1997 Joint action on new synthetic drugs, stems from recent findings on the health and social risks of the drug released by the Lisbon-based EU drugs agency, the EMCDDA. These are summarised in a risk-assessment report on PMMA adopted on 29 October in Lisbon by the agency’s Scientific Committee and additional experts. The report assesses the risks of PMMA, especially in association with the already controlled substance PMA (para-methoxyamphetamine). PMMA, is an amphetamine-like substance very close to PMA, and is almost exclusively sold in tablet form in combination with the latter and consumed as ‘ecstasy’. It has been associated, in combination with PMA, with three deaths in the EU. PMMA is devoid of any therapeutic value. Following the Council decision, and in line with their national laws, EU Member States will have a maximum of three months to introduce the necessary measures to submit PMMA to controls, according to their obligations under the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Unlike PMA, PMMA is not currently listed in the Schedules to this Convention. The decision to control PMMA is largely due to the high risks of overdose associated with it, especially when combined with PMA. Users believing the tablets to be ecstasy (MDMA), and confused by their unusually slow effects, may be tempted to consume more pills and subsequently overdose. Also noteworthy are the serious risks resulting from mixing the drug with alcohol, MDMA, amphetamines and ephedrine. Trafficking and distribution of PMMA have taken place in four EU Member States, three of which have information on the role of organised crime in the trafficking of PMMA/PMA. It is reported that 18,870 tablets containing PMMA have been seized in 29 incidents in the 15 countries. Large-scale production of PMMA does not take place in the EU. Two laboratories have been seized in countries of Eastern Europe and production is believed to continue there. The Council decision confirms the effectiveness of the early-warning and risk-assessment mechanism provided under the Joint action. PMMA was detected on the European market via the early-warning system run by the respective networks of the EMCDDA and Europol. This was the fifth-risk assessment procedure carried out under the Joint action. One synthetic drug, namely 4-MTA (‘flatliners’), was made subject to control measures on 13 September 1999. Other risk assessments involved the substances: MBDB; ketamine; and GHB. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2002/council-decides-pmma-should-be-placed-under-control_en

The agreement was signed by Executive Director of the EMCDDA, Georges Estievenart, accompanied by Chairman of the EMCDDA Management Board Mike Trace, and Director of Europol Jürgen Storbeck. The purpose of the agreement is to enhance co-operation between the two bodies, particularly through the exchange of strategic and technical information. It will help heighten collaboration in areas such as: collecting and analysing data; disseminating information; exchanging technical expertise; and ensuring the most effective use of resources. It could also open the way for joint projects. The document specifies that: ‘Co-operation between the two organisations shall be limited to drug-related matters and associated illegal money laundering activities, and diversion of chemical precursors, in accordance with their respective mandates...’. Both parties will ensure that information received on the basis of this agreement will be subject to their confidentiality and security standards for the processing of information. No data on individuals or groups of individuals will be exchanged. The agreement builds on the already strong links between the two organisations in the context of implementing the 1997 Joint action on new synthetic drugs. More recently new steps have been taken in the areas of collecting data on drug seizures; and preparing a methodological tool to evaluate the ongoing EU Action Plan on Drugs (2000–2004). Today’s meeting ‘Identifying, understanding and responding to the problem of amphetamine- type stimulants (ATS): what solutions?’ took place at the Palais d’Egmont, Brussels. Among the dignitaries attending the event were Belgian Minister of Justice Marc Verwilghen, Belgian Minister of Health Magda Aelvoet, and current Head of the Council’s Horizontal Working Party of Drugs Claude Gillard, also Belgian representative on the EMCDDA’s Management Board. This Co-operation Agreement enters into force tomorrow, the day on which the EMCDDA launches its 2001 Annual report on the state of the drugs problem in the European Union at the European Parliament in Brussels. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2001/emcdda-and-europol-sign-co-operation-agreement_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0628	2001-04-26	UNK	Key role of modelling in shedding light on drug use	 The key role of dynamic modelling in helping to understand problem drug use is stressed in a publication out today from the Lisbon-based EU drugs agency, the EMCDDA. Modelling drug use: methods to quantify and understand hidden processes – the latest edition in the EMCDDA’s scientific monograph series – offers, in the words of drugs agency chief Georges Estievenart, ‘an overview of the application of mathematical and statistical techniques in the field of drug use’. It ‘clearly points to the potential for using models for analysing and understanding drug data’. Estievenart adds: ‘I believe that dynamic modelling can help decision-makers and scientists to better understand the hidden processes of drug use, epidemiological trends and their relationships, and thus contribute to sound decision-making on policies and interventions.’ A key EMCDDA task is to analyse and make sense of data on drug use and its consequences in the EU. This is a prerequisite for developing rational interventions and policies. Today’s publication explores the potential role of modelling in this task. It says drug use and drug problems involve complex information. Modelling might help to enhance the interpretation of available but scarce data and increase the understanding of unobservable processes and relationships. In particular, it can serve to describe the dynamics of drug use at a more abstract or aggregated, local, national or international level. Difficult to ‘sell’ The monograph explains that it is this high level of abstraction that can make modelling somewhat difficult to ‘sell’, especially to professionals nearer to individual drug users, since the results of modelling studies seldom relate to individual experiences. But, it points out, it is exactly this abstraction that gives modelling its strength – by detecting common features within available data sets or by clarifying relationships between more abstract concepts such as law enforcement, price and demand for drugs. Here is just a flavour of the concepts covered in the publication: Discussion of a very successful method in generating predictions of AIDS and HIV – the back-calculation method. The agency plans to use this in estimating incidence or rates of initiation of heroin use from routine drug-treatment data. Knowing such rates would enable more direct evaluation of activities that aim to prevent drug users from starting to use heroin than is possible with prevalence estimates. Use of compartmental models is useful for analysing drug ‘careers’. This method has been employed for several diseases, as well as studying processes that lead young people to initiate drug use. System-dynamic models – used mostly to describe macro-scale drug phenomena and national policy scenarios, such as drug imports, treatment and law enforcement. These are relatively well-suited for macro-level analysis as they measure flows as aggregate measures rather than keeping track of individual persons or events. The EMCDDA hopes that this monograph – and the European network of modellers behind it – will prove significant in stimulating the application of quantitative techniques to drug data. It concludes: ‘As good and comparable data on drugs are still rather scarce in Europe, progress is not expected to be very rapid. However, with increasing work on improving data sources and growing understanding of the basic knowledge needed for sound policy-making, mathematical and statistical modelling forms a valuable part of the set of tools available to understand and prevent the problems caused by the use of drugs.’ Note to editors: Modelling is a technical way of simplifying complex processes. This is mostly achieved on a computer or with mathematical formulae by describing the components of the process, and the relationships between them, in a formal or quantitative way. The result is called a ‘model’. By manipulating or experimenting with the model, conclusions can be drawn that cannot be found by direct observation of drug users. Dynamic models can be used to generate estimates where data are sparse or to test hypotheses about drug use in so-called ‘mind experiments’ or ‘what if?’ studies. The simple act of building a model forces a researcher to make explicit statements about the process being studied, which usually leads to discussion and improved insight. 	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2001/key-role-modelling-shedding-light-drug-use_en
EMCDDA_UNK_0629	2001-03-15	UNK	EU acts on rising concern over synthetic drugs GHB and ketamine	 The EU today responded to rising concern over the misuse of GHB and ketamine. Since the mid-1990s, these two synthetic substances – widely used in human and veterinary medicine for 30 years – have been surfacing as recreational drugs. Some EU countries have reported worries over GHB’s surreptitious use in sexual assaults. Although the extent of this is unknown, the EMCDDA and its risk-assessment partners are recommending that Member States consider the role of GHB and other drugs in this area. Concern over ketamine centres on its unpredictability in producing ‘near-death’ experiences. Today the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council, meeting in Brussels, adopted formal conclusions that Member States should monitor both drugs closely. These follow conclusions by the Council’s Horizontal Working Party on Drugs, and previous proposals from the European Commission, on two risk-assessment reports drawn up last year by the EU drugs agency, the EMCDDA. Today’s Council conclusions call for ‘active’ monitoring of GHB this year and continued monitoring of ketamine. The EMCDDA and Europol are asked to report on this monitoring by the end of the year. On the basis of this, the Council will consider if control at EU level is appropriate. Drugs agency chief Georges Estievenart says: ‘There is a need to target objective information on both substances to vulnerable at-risk groups.’ At the Council’s request, the drugs agency and Europol will monitor: Consumption, trafficking, and public health related problems linked to GHB – in particular, its clinical effects; prevalence and patterns of use; seizures; the role of organised crime in production, diversion and trafficking; and that of the Internet in marketing it for non-medical use. Manufacture, trafficking, patterns of use and health consequences of ketamine, particularly trends in recreational use. Member States are invited to share information on preventive and risk-reduction measures related to the non-medical use of GHB, including appropriate messages to users. They are also invited to submit proposals for research into the effects of ketamine use. These will be considered under the EU’s Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Development. The Council calls on the European Commission to report on the state of negotiations with the chemical industry on the key issue of limiting diversion of GHB and its precursors. It also urges that possible improvements in the control of ketamine diversion be discussed with the pharmaceutical industry. An important factor here is ensuring the drug’s continued availability for medical and veterinary use. The EMCDDA reports particular concerns over the diversion of ketamine from legitimate supply to the black market – being difficult to manufacture, the drug is often stolen from veterinary clinics. There are also worries over involvement of organised crime and the health risk of tablets passed off as ‘ecstasy’. The agency notes the development of a ‘kitchen-sink’ GHB ‘industry’, since the drug can be made easily without special equipment. ‘Dark’ and ‘near-death’ experiences Legitimate uses of GHB, an anaesthetic, include treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Misuse of the drug brings out its darker side, posing significant health risks, due to the narrow margin between a recreational dose and one leading to unconsciousness or, in rare cases, irreversible coma. A very fine line divides the relaxation and euphoria the drug can induce and its potentially dangerous consequences. The drug is taken orally and also offered as liquid or a powder. Once dissolved, it is difficult to detect, being colourless, odourless and relatively tasteless. This makes it unobtrusive in groups of people drinking alcohol. GHB’s various street names include ‘liquid ecstasy’ ‘easy lay’ ‘scoop’ and ‘fantasy’. Ketamine is traditionally used as a veterinary anaesthetic and also, to a lesser extent, in human medicine – for example, in treating burn victims. Recreationally, it’s injected as a liquid or inhaled as powder. Its street names include K, KitKat, cat valium, vitamin K and super K. Misuse can lead to psychological dependence, loss of self-control and acute intoxication. It is said to produce ‘out-of-body’ or (in larger doses) ’near-death’ experiences. With an upmarket image, its use appears higher among older, highly-educated, experienced MDMA users – particularly in the new-age traveller or gay club scenes. Ketamine is sometimes sold under the guise of ecstasy. As its effect depends very much on the dose, uncertainty about its concentration in ecstasy tablets poses particular risks.

EMCDDA_UNK_0648	1999-09-15	UNK	Council decides new drug 4-MTA should be placed under control	 The Council of the European Union adopted a unanimous decision on 13 September defining the new synthetic drug 4-MTA (4-methylthioamphetamine) as a substance to be placed under control measures and criminal penalties in the EU Member States. The decision, taken in the framework of the 1997 Joint Action on New Synthetic Drugs, stems from recent findings on the health and social risks of the drug released by the Lisbon-based European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). These are summarised in a ‘Report on the Risk Assessment of 4-MTA’ adopted on 19 May in Lisbon by the EU drug agency’s Scientific Committee and experts. The Report recommends that the drug be controlled largely due to the high risks of overdose associated with it. These risks result from the slow onset of the drugs’ effects – often misinterpreted by users as the result of a weak dose, leading to the consumption of more pills – and their long-lasting nature. Also highlighted in the Report are the serious risks resulting from mixing the drug with alcohol, MDMA, amphetamines, ephedrine and certain foods. Following its adoption, the Report was submitted on 24 May to the German Presidency of the Horizontal Drugs Group (HDG) of the Council and to the European Commission for further action in accordance with Article 5 of the Joint Action (procedures for bringing specific new synthetic drugs under control). The Report was presented and discussed at the meeting of the HDG on 18 June and, on 7 July, the Commission submitted a proposal to the Council calling for the drug to be brought under control. Under this decision, and in accordance with their national laws, Member States shall take a maximum of three months to introduce the necessary measures to submit 4-MTA to control measures and criminal penalties as provided for under the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. This week’s decision confirms the speed and effectiveness of the early-warning and risk- assessment mechanism provided under the two-year old Joint Action. The decision by the Council came just six months after first notification of the substance by the EMCDDA and Europol. Before the summer, the EMCDDA issued a warning on 4-MTA to its national networks in reaction to misleading and scientifically unfounded media reports suggesting that 4-MTA is ’33 times stronger than normal ecstasy’. The agency was concerned that this type of coverage may inadvertently promote use of the drug among ecstasy users and lead them to expect a relatively quick and dramatic effect. 4-MTA is generally found in the form of cream-coloured pills or tablets and has the street name ‘flat-liners’.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/1999/council-decides-new-drug-4-mta-should-be-placed-under-control_en

EMCDDA_UNK_0662	1998-05-01	UNK	MBDB: First test of Joint Action in practice	 On 27 February, the UK Presidency, of the European Union acting on behalf of the 15 Member States, formally referred a new synthetic drug, N-Methyl-1-(1,3- benzodioxol 5-yl)-2-butanamine (MBDB) to the EMCDDA for risk assessment under Article 4 of the Joint Action on New Synthetic Drugs adopted on 16 June 1997.* The Presidency asked the Member States to assist the assessment process by reporting any recent inci- dences of, or other relevant infor- mation on, MBDB to the EMCDDA and the Europol Drugs Unit (EDU) by means of the exchange mechanism described in Article 3. Although MBDB is not listed in Schedules 1 or 2 of t he 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, it is not a totally new synthetic drug. Over recent years, cases involving the drug have been reported in almost all Member States, making information collection easier than in situations in- volving a totally new substance. In the context of Article 3 of the Joint Action, the EMCDDA and the EDU have agreed to submit a joint report,clargely focusing on MBDB to the Horizontal Drugs Group of the Council of the European Union on 20 May. The Presidency will then report the progress made to the European Council meeting in Cardiff, UK, from 15–16 June. The EDU will cover production and trafficking of MBDB and the EMCDDA its use and possible risks (both health and social). To this end, the EMCDDA has circulated a questionnaire to the National Focal Points requesting information on MBDB and is exa- mining other sources including the Internet, data from relevant organisations and current scientific literature. At the same time, steps have been taken in prepara- tion for the risk-assessment procedure (Article 4). The EMCDDA's Scientific Committee, under whose auspices the assessment will be undertaken, has es- tablished a Steering Group to develop criteria, guidelines and procedures. The EMCDDA has also created an internal Task Force to prepare the special risk assessment meeting of the Scientific Committee, to be held later in 1998, which will be attended by experts from the Member States, the Commission, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and the EDU. MBDB presents a challenging first test of the Joint Action in practice.  	https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/news/2018/mbdb-first-test-joint-action-practice_en
