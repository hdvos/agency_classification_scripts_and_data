ACER_NEWS_0001	2021-06-11	Building trans-European energy infrastructure: ACER finds that more than half of the projects are on time, but observes several delays and some potentially non-robust Projects of Common Interest (PCIs)	 Section 1 Body HtmlACER has published the 7thedition of its annual report on the progress of electricity and gas Projects of Common Interest (PCIs​) for trans-European energy infrastructure.​Overall, ACER notes a positive trend in their advancement: about two-thirds of the electricity and gas PCIs are already in permit granting, under construction or commissioned, while about one-third of them are less advanced, being under consideration or planned, but not yet in the permitting phase,the implementation of more than half of the PCIs progressed in a timely manner, 70% of the projects are expected to be implemented by 2025.However, ACER notes that about 25% of the electricity and gas projects cumulate delays from year to year, and several additional projects are postponed by their promoters. ACER also identified some PCIs that did not advance their status over the past six years (with most of them remaining in the permitting phase). This led ACER to conclude that project promoters' projections were too optimistic.The report also warns about potentially non-robust PCIs, which did not carry out any work or activity during the reporting period, being on hold or rescheduled by the project promoters for at least 2 years, and/or failed to move forward from an early advancement status for several years. ACER calls for additional scrutiny during the PCI selection for such projects to ensure the robustness of the 5th PCI list, so that only projects which are clearly a priority are included.​​​Robust PCIs are crucial to achieve carbon-neutral energy systems in the futureEnergy networks play a key role in the transition to carbon-neutral energy systems. As PCIs are key cross-border electricity and gas infrastructure projects that enhance the links between the energy systems across Europe, they also play a crucial role in helping the EU to achieve its energy policy and climate objectives by delivering socio-economic and environmental benefits.Access the PCI Report​ and related Annex I for project specific information on electricity PCIs and Annex II for further information on Gas PCIs.----------------------------------------------------​-------------------------------Background information​By way of background, the broader framework in Europe for cross-border energy infrastructure (the TEN-E framework) is currently under negotiation by the European Parliament and the Council.Here, ACER, together with CEER, has made several recommendations on how to improve the overall PCI framework (including the governance of infrastructure development, the scope of PCIs and the TEN-E processes) with the aim of promoting a neutral and independent technical assessment and ensuring support to those projects bringing most benefits for the European Green Deal and to avoid any risks of unjustified costs for consumers. For more information, please refer to ACER-CEER Position Papers of 5 March 2021 and 19 June 2020 as well as earlier ACER Position Papers published in 2017 and 2016.	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Building-trans-European-energy-infrastructure.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0002	2021-06-07	Register for ACER Webinar on the High-level Approach to Identify Alternative Bidding Zone Configurations for a more efficient energy market	 Section 1 Body Html​The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) opens registration today for an online webinar on 24 June 2021 to present the high-level approach that ACER intends to follow for the definition of alternative bidding zone configurations to be considered in the bidding zone review process, according to the EU Regulation on the Internal Market for Electricity.Register by 22 June and access the agenda.​ What are the bidding zones?Bidding zones, as the largest geographical areas within which market participants are able to exchange energy without capacity allocation, represent a cornerstone of market-based electricity trading and should therefore be defined in a manner to ensure efficient congestion management and overall market efficiency. In particular, bidding zone borders shall be based on long-term, structural congestions in the transmission network and the configuration of bidding zones shall be designed in such a way as to maximise economic efficiency and to maximise cross-zonal trading opportunities, while maintaining security of supply.What can you learn in this webinar?This webinar will present ACER's high-level approach for the definition of alternative bidding zone configurations as well as how clustering algorithms can be applied on nodal simulation results to support the identification of alternative bidding zone configurations.A public consultation on relevant aspects of this high-level approach is planned to be launched shortly after this webinar takes place. ​​	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Register-for-ACER-Webinar-on-the-High-level-Approach-to-Identify-Alternative-Bidding-Zone-configurations-for-a-more-efficie.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0003	2021-06-04	ACER to decide on the long-term cross-border capacity calculation methodology for the Core region, comprised of 13 Member States	 Section 1 Body Html​​​​​​The National Regulatory Authorities of the Core region asked the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) to decide on the long-term capacity calculation methodology (LT CCM) for the region.The Core region comprises 13 countries: Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Croatia, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.What are the benefits?Long‐term cross-border capacity calculation promotes effective long‐term cross‐zonal trade. By calculating reliable capacities and making them available to market participants at an early stage, long-term capacity calculation allows for long‐term planning and provides hedging opportunities.The long-term capacity calculation methodology for the Core region shall cover yearly and monthly capacity calculation processes, by applying the flow-based approach.How exactly will this ACER Decision contribute to a more integrated European electricity market?ACER's Decision will contribute to the effectiveness and integration of the Core electricity markets by establishing the common rules for calculating the long-term cross-zonal capacity at regional level. ​Next steps:ACER will launch a public consultation for four weeks; expected dates are from 5 – 31 July 2021.On 9 July, ACER will organise a workshop on this topic.​ ACER expects to reach its decision by 3rd November 2021.​​	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-to-decide-on-the-long-term-cross-border-capacity-calculation-methodology-for-the-Core-region,-comprised-of-13-Member-S.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0004	2021-06-02	ACER releases its second 70% target report on the minimum margin available for cross-zonal electricity trade in the EU	" Section 1 Body Html​Europe's Clean Energy Package (CEP) has set a binding minimum 70% target for electricity interconnector capacity for cross-zonal trading (the 'minimum 70% target'), to be met by all Transmission System Operators (TSOs).The minimum 70% target is legally binding since the start of 2020, but Member States may also adopt transitory measures, such as action plans or derogations, thus allowing TSOs to reach gradually the minimum 70% target, by the end of 2025 at the latest.Why is monitoring the 'minimum 70% target' im​portant?The lack of sufficient cross-zonal capacity in between Member States ​is one of the main barriers to the integration of electricity markets, and market integration is key to deliver on Europe's energy goals. Larger amounts of cross-zonal capacity made available for trade increase cross-border competition and enhance the integration of renewable energy sources.ACER's monitoring aims to identify consistently across the EU the scope for improvement to meet the minimum 70% target. How are Member States doing? Efforts needed in all countries to reach the 70% targetACER's second “70% Target Report"" provides an overview of the levels of margins for cross-zonal capacity compared to the minimum legally binding 70% target for the second half of 2020, and on action plans and derogations. It also highlights the changes compared to the first report (which related to the first half of 2020).Ma​​in findings of the report:Member States have much more to do to get closer to the legally binding minimum 70% target.The levels of margins for cross-zonal capacity is mixed across the EU and are broadly similar to the levels observed in the first ​half of 2020.Member States should work to meet the 70% minimum target at all times, and to reach their target national transitional targets to gradually reach the 70% minimum.How? Members States can count on several measures at their disposal to improve the level of margin offered such as cost-efficient investments; use of remedial actions; and bidding zone reconfiguration, to help them to reach the target.The levels of cro​ss-zonal capacity are very diverse depending on the type of border and geographical location:- On high-voltage Direct Current (DC) borders, the 70% target was met most of the time but with a few notable exceptions.- On Alternating Current (AC) borders, there is a very diverse picture with significant room for improvement to meet the 70% target for most regions and borders.ACER's monitoring depends critically on TSOs providing robust and extensive data. ACER acknowledges the efforts made by a majority of TSOs to improve the provision of data. However, the completeness and quality of this data needs to be urgently improved in some regions.Regarding action plans and derogations, ACER finds significant room for further harmonising their setup across the EU. Regulatory authorities should grant derogations as a last resort measure, and only where necessary for maintaining operational security.For consistency, national regulatory authorities (NRAs) should consider the results of ACER's analysis to assess the compliance of TSOs with the minimum 70% target.​Access to the ACER's comprehensive Report and detailed Annexes​"	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-releases-its-second-70-target-report-on-the-minimum-margin-available-for-cross-zonal-electricity-trade-in-the-EU.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0005	2021-05-28	Gas contractual congestion decreases by 50% in the EU	 Section 1 Body Html​​The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) found a halving of gas contractual congestion in the EU transmission networks according to its 8th specialised report on the subject published today. Contractual congestion may signal a reduction of market efficiency. It happens when some network users were not able to obtain the capacity product of their choice and had to rely on congestion-mitigating measures (CMPs) to access the gas market.8th Congestion Report in the EU Gas Markets and How it is Managed​Technical Annex to the Report ​Has COVID-19 effected gas capacity auctions? In 2020, the occurrences of auction premia, which arise when requests for capacity exceed the offer, dropped by 70% compared to 2019. COVID-related uncertainty as well as general demand and supply dynamics may affect whether auction premia will return in 2021 or remain scarce at around 0.6% of all auctions in scope of the analysis. How much congestion? In 2020, congestion has halved compared to previous years with 19 Interconnection Point (IP) exit and entry sides in 2020 compared to 37 exits and entries in 2019).  Half of the congestion is due to auction premia, which occurred in the auctions of yearly and quarterly capacity products. The other half is due to the lack of offer of any capacity products with a duration of one month or longer.Has any progress been registered? While the number of congested IP sides is low, local contractual congestion can be severe and reduce market efficiency. Around 85% of the congested IP sides in 2020 were also congested in the past. What comes next? Transmission System Operators ('TSOs') can apply a number of CMPs to ensure network users can access the network even when they could not obtain some capacity products in the primary capacity auctions. The Oversubscription mechanism remains the most applied CMP despite its decreased use in 2020; that decrease is partly compensated by an increased use of Firm Day-Ahead Use-It-Or-Lose-It and Surrender as CMP measures.More than 60% of the congested IP sides are already covered by the FDA UIOLI mechanism, while for the other half the respective National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) need to take action in line with the European Commission's rules on congestion. Main recommendations ACER recommends the European Commission to revise the CMP Guidelines to enhance the effectiveness of the measures. ACER recommends ENTSOG and TSOs to continue improving data reliability to ensure the accuracy of information available at the ENTSOG Transparency Platform. ACER's call on researchersThe Congestion Report has a narrow scope of analysis, while a substantial amount of congestion data is available for deeper and broader analysis. The report has suggestions for further research and ACER calls on researchers to use the substantial amount of available data to study different aspects of congestion in EU gas markets.	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Gas-contractual-congestion-decreases-by-50-in-the-EU--.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0006	2021-05-26	ACER published a Decision requesting information to monitor the level of margin available for cross-border electricity trade in the Nordics	" Section 1 Body Html​The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) published today a Decision requesting the three Nordic transmission system operators Svenska kraftnät (Sweden), Energinet Elsystemansvar A/S (Denmark) and Fingrid Oyj (Finland) to provide specific information related to those network elements that are limiting the capacity calculation, the so-called critical network elements with contingencies (“CNECs"").This information is needed by ACER to monitor the level of margin available for cross-border trade on CNECs and to compare it with the 70% minimum target defined by the Electricity Regulation.Access the ACER Decision 03/2021 and related Annexes.​"	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-published-a-Decision-requesting-information-to-monitor-the-level-of-margin-available-for-cross-border-electricity-trad.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0007	2021-05-18	Registration open for ACER webinar on its proposal for a Framework Guideline to establish a Network Code on Cybersecurity (27 May 2021)	 Section 1 Body Html​ACER organises this online webinar to present and explain the content of its proposed non-binding Framework Guideline on sector-specific rules for cybersecurity asp​ects of cross-border electricity flows.The event will take place on Thursday 27 May 2021, from 09.30 to 12.00.Register by Tuesday 25 May and access the agenda.​ The importance of cybersecurity is increasing, given the growing technological​ development and a more digitally driven and interconnected energy system. The modern energy system is not limited by national borders. As a result, cyberattacks may have cross border effects. The non-binding Framework Guideline is developed by ACER on request of the EU Commission. It shall set out clear and objective principles for the development of a binding Cybersecurity Network Code that will contribute to maintain the security of the electricity system across Europe. The ongoing public consultation is open until 29 June 2021.ACER is inviting stakeholders to join the webinar to learn more about the content of its ​proposal​, as well as about the process and timeline for the adoption of the new Network Code.If necessary, participation may be restricted to one person per organisation.​	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Registration-open-for-ACER-webinar-on-its-proposal-for-a-Framework-Guideline-to-establish-a-Network-Code-on-Cybersecurity.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0008	2021-05-18	ACER and ENTSOG publish a new solution to issue raised on Gas Network Codes Functionality platform	" Section 1 Body Html​​ACER and ENTSOG have published a solution on the Gas Network Codes Functionality (FUNC) platform, related to the issue ""Dutch TSO requirement of message PRODOC"".​The platform allows relevant parties to notify implementation and operational issues related to the gas Network Codes.​ The web-based platform collects the issues and facilitate cooperation among stakeholders to find relevant solutions.In February 2020, the European Association for the Streamlining of Energy Exchange – gas (EASEE-gas)​ reported that the Dutch TSO requirement of message PRODOC is unnecessary and contrary to Network Code on Gas Balancing of Transmission. PRODOC is a document containing information about the load forecast that a balancing responsible party sends to the system operator as part of the daily balance area management process for the day ahead.When processing the issue, ACER and ENTSOG were made aware that the use of the PRODOC message is a requirement under Dutch national law. In the issue solution, ACER and ENTSOG conclude that the review of the Dutch Energy Act is pending, and it foresees to discontinue the PRODOC requirement in the future. Since the changes in the national law remain a precondition to solve this issue and since the preparatory work for the legislative changes are ready, ACER and ENTSOG propose that the issue be solved at the national level.The solution paper and relevant documents are available on the FUNC platform. ​​"	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Gas-Network-Codes-Functionality-platform-ACER-and-ENTSOG-publish-a-new-solution-.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0009	2021-05-12	Consultation launched on Gas Interconnection Points between the EU and the Energy Community and within the Energy Community	 Section 1 Body Html​The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Energy Community Secretariat (ECS) launched today a joint public consultation regarding gas capacity on a number of interconnection points (IPs) on the borders of the EU and the Energy Community and within the Energy Community.The consultation focuses on capacity offering and use and aims at reaching a better understanding of market needs, approaches to avoiding network interruptions, and optimising capacity availability at gas interconnectors between the EU and the Energy Community and within the Energy Community. The results of the consultation will benefit market integration, competition and ultimately gas consumers.ACER and the Energy Community Secretariat are particularly interested in hearing from users (actual and potential) of gas transport capacity and other services provided by transmission system operators (TSO) on the gas pipelines concerned.By way of this consultation, both organisations seek to gain a firmer understanding of stakeholders' views on best practices in pursuit of enhancing connectivity, optimal use of existing capacity, market integration, and competition at the concerned IPs. ACER and ECS consult the market to better understand market needs and to learn about possible approaches to avoid network interruptions and to optimise in general terms the capacity availability at EU/ Energy Community IPs.The questionnaire is framed to allow respondents to share their views on approaches ensuring the optimal use of capacity and secure and reliable flow of gas, whilst allowing for proper cooperation with regard to improving gas network services at the relevant IPs. Input from the consultation will be used by ACER and ECS to derive and share possible best practices in view of achieving better functioning markets, efficient use of infrastructure and improved security of supply. Replies to the consultation can be submitted by 30 June 2021 23:59 hrs (CET).To learn more and submit your views, visit the P​ublic Consultation webpage​​.ACER and the ECS will analyse the responses received will publish a summary of the consultation, including an evaluation of the responses. ​	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Consultation-launched-on-Gas-Interconnection-Points-between-the-EU-and-the-Energy-Community-and-within-the-Energy-Community.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0011	2021-05-10	ACER has reached a Decision on the definition of capacity calculation regions	 Section 1 Body Html​The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) has reached a Decision on all Transmission System Operators (TSOs)' proposal defining the Capacity Calculation Regions (CCR).​This definition includes all the​ European Union's bidding zone borders and groups them into the different capacity calculation regions. This is relevant for the functioning of the internal energy market, as it simplifies processes by forming such sub-groups (i.e. CCRs).The determination of CCRs should combine the bidding zone borders for which the need of coordination is the highest (e.g. taking into account the interdependencies between their cross-zonal capacities) and consider where it is most efficient to apply cross regional coordination. Different regional methodologies (such as capacity calculation, re-dispatching and countertrading) will be applied on the various capacity calculation regions. This will promote an effective coordination between bidding zone borders, which enables an optimal use of transmission infrastructure across Europe, with consequential benefits for consumers. This Decision reflects the latest status of the internal energy market, including new or evolved bidding zone borders, additional TSOs and considering UK's withdrawal from the European Union.​Access the ACER Decision 04-2021 and relative Annexes​.​	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-has-reached-a-Decision-on-the-definition-of-capacity-calculation-regions.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0012	2021-05-04	ACER finds serious shortcomings in ENTSOG's gas network plans – underlining the need for current TEN-E reforms to strengthen independent project assessments	" Section 1 Body Html​​​Every 2 years, ACER provides a non-binding opinion on the draft grid plans (called Ten-Year Network Development Plans or TYNDPs) proposed by the network operators.In its Opinions on the draft 2020 plans, ACER finds that the electricity and gas plans (developed by ENTSO-E and ENTSOG respectively) do not sufficiently contribute to the efficient market due to several shortcomings. With respect to gas,​ in ACER's view:Too many conventional gas projects - close to €75 billion – are proposed by network operators and not all are assessed by ENTSOG. Despite ongoing efforts, the framework also fails to properly assess the contribution of gas projects to sustainability.The TYNDP core building blocks need to be improved such as scenarios development and cost-benefit analysis (CBA). There are also shortcomings in public consultations with stakeholders on key elements of the energy projects being proposed by network operators.A number of shortcomings could be remedied by legislators in the current TEN-E reforms by strengthening the independent assessment of projects and the regulatory oversight of network operators. ACER has previously pointed to risks of lack of neutrality of the two European Networks of Transmission System Operators (ENTSOs) and the need for step changes in TEN-E governance to avoid conflict of interests while ensuring transparency.See also the ACER Opinion on the ENTSO-E electricity network plan.​Shortcomings could be remedied by improving the TEN-E RegulationThe EU framework for energy infrastructure needs to be robust for cost-efficient cross-border projects which are best for the energy transition. ACER believes that the shortcomings of the TYNDP process as can be remedied by improving the TEN-E investment framework in line with the European Green Deal. To this end, regulators (ACER and CEER) issued two position papers, one in March 2021 and one in June 2020​ on how to improve the revision of TEN-E Regulation including on infrastructure development governance.ACER has called on the European co-legislators to consider the regulators' proposals as a solution to promote a neutral technical assessment of infrastructure projects in line with the European Green Deal, avoiding risks of unjustified costs to European consumers.For example, currently the transmission system operators (TSOs), through the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSOs), develop the scenarios to assess projects in different futures. TSOs can be perceived as biased towards favouring more infrastructure as it is in their interest. The neutrality of scenarios and the credibility of the TYNDP process can thus be compromised. To safeguard neutrality, regulators have proposed the introduction of ACER framework guidelines for TYNDP scenarios for the ENTSOs to follow. This has been taken up in the European Commission's legislative proposals but should be further strengthened and streamlined, as suggested by regulators.Europe's energy regulators have pointed to the need for strengthened regulatory scrutiny over the ENTSO's to safeguard the public interest, for ACER to be given the powers to approve the methodologies for the Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBAs) which are used to assess projects, and to issue binding guidelines to the ENTSOs for the TYNDP development. What are ACER's key findings of the 2020 draft gas TYNDP?ACER has issued an Opinion on the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG) TYNDP 2020 for gas. The ACER Opinion is addressed to ENTSOG, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council.ACER finds that the draft gas TYNDP 2020 follows a similar methodology as previous editions. What are the key improvements in the 2020 draft gas TYNDP?ACER's opinion notes limited improvements and evolution of the draft plan in comparison to previous TYNDP. Improvements are mainly limited to a better presentation of results and for the first time, the inclusion of a heterogeneous category of projects addressing the energy transition. ACER concurs with ENTSOG that current gas infrastructure in Europe is resilient, near to the completion of the internal gas market and that the limited infrastructure investment gaps will be closed in the next five years by projects already currently under development. What are the key shortcomings of the 2020 draft gas TYNDP?ACER regrets that the TYNDP includes a broad investment portfolio of conventional gas projects close to € 75 billion, clearly exceeding reasonable needs, in view of the lack of market appetite for developing additional transmission capacities and the decarbonisation objectives. Less than half of these are assessed by ENTSOG in the TYNDP framework. As regards the sustainability assessment of projects, although progress in observed in this TYNDP, there is room to refine it further in the future.ENTSOG should consider ways to increase stakeholders' interest and engagement in the TYNDP development process, in view of the low number of responses (9) received during its public consultation.ACER identifies 4 main shortcomings:Lack of proper analysis of the existing and forecasted use of gas infrastructure as critical criterion to take into account when analysing the need of additional gas infrastructure.Shortcomings in the applied methodologies, such as a lack of a complete quantitative needs assessment and doubtful quality of the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) methodology and its application which still requires improvement to demonstrate benefits exceed costs so that each individual gas project contributes to sustainability.The asymmetric treatment of candidate projects depending on whether the projects are intending to apply for Project of Common Interest (PCI) selection or not. ACER expects ENTSOG to apply project-specific cost-benefit analysis for all projects, the same way it is done for the electricity.Shortcomings in the public consultations of the scenarios methodology and the needs methodology.In ACER's Opinion the draft gas TYNDP 2020 does not sufficiently contribute to the objectives of non-discrimination and efficient functioning of the market.What does ACER recommend for improving future gas TYNDPs?ACER is of the view that improvements in European infrastructure planning are feasible. ACER encourages the ENTSOs to address the remaining shortcomings and stands ready to provide guidance or clarifications where needed. ACER proposes several recommendations to ENTSOG in pursuit of an efficient, further integrated and transparent network planning at the service of consumers, decarbonisation, and sector integration ambitions:For the Final Gas TYNDP 2020Consider the National Regulatory Authority's (NRA's) comments on the TYNDP 2020 projectsProvide a feedback document on how the Public Consultation and ACER's Opinion have been taken into accountClassify the energy transition projects into gas supply/ production projects and network related investmentsComplete information related to project CBA assessments Update information on projects' status by end of year 2020For the Gas TYNDP 2022 and beyondImplement ACER's recommendations on scenariosImprove planning process to avoid recurring delays, by publishing next TYNDP by mid-2022Incorporate the market perspective on infrastructure gapsImprove the implementation of CBA methodologyInclude a number of “conventional"" gas infrastructure projects commensurate to the assessed needs, by flagging and filtering out unrealistic projects during the data collection stageRoll out modelling tools allowing for sector-integrated assessments of electricity and gas projectsProvide the same (maximum) level of cost transparency for all TYNDP regulated projectsMore attention focused on adaptations of gas infrastructure for the injection of higher shares of renewable, low carbon and de-carbonised gases (hydrogen, synthetic methane, and bio-methane) Together with ENTSO-E, identify suitable locations for power-to-gas installations in the system needs analysisFactor the level of utilisation and congestion of existing infrastructure in the needs assessmentConsider ways of covering methane emissions associated with gas infrastructureWhat is the TYNDP?Every two years, ENTSOG publishes a non-binding TYNDP which looks forward over a ten-year horizon and includes a European supply adequacy outlook for natural gas. TYNDPs are essential for assessing and identifying the need of new infrastructure projects to ensure an adequate level of security of gas supply, market integration and competition. The TYNDP must be consistent with National Development Plans (NDPs) and should take into account the energy policy objective of decarbonisation under the European Green Deal.Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) are selected from the TYNDP via a separate process led by the European Commission. The TYNDP should provide essential and comprehensive information for the selection of PCIs, in particular through complete, monetised, and reliable cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and a sustainability assessment of projects.What is the role of ACER and its overall assessment?ACER monitors the development and execution of the plan, and issues an opinion on the draft TYNDP taking into account the objectives of non-discrimination, effective competition, and the efficient and secure functioning of the internal gas market. ACER also looks to the alignment of the plan with broader energy transition and decarbonisation goals."	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-finds-serious-shortcomings-in-ENTSOs%E2%80%99-energy-network-plans.aspx

Unbalanced CBA due to the missing, non-traceable Current Trends scenario.Lack of CBA analysis after the study year 2030.Poor and insufficient consultations of the scenarios methodology and of the needs methodology.​​In ACER's opinion the draft electricity TYNDP 2020 does not sufficiently contribute to the objective of efficient functioning of the market.What does ACER recommend for improving future electricity TYNDPs?ACER encourages the ENTSOs to address the remaining shortcomings and stands ready to provide guidance or clarifications where needed. ACER proposes several recommendations to ENTSO-E in pursuit of an efficient, further integrated and transparent network planning to serve European consumers and Europe's decarbonisation and sector integration ambitions:For the Final Electricity TYNDP 2020Provide the storyline and full data for the missing Current Trends scenario. Publish the baseline capacities per border as used in the starting grid for the needs exercise and in the reference grids for the CBA calculations. Include a Benefit / Cost ratio and Net Present Value calculation for all projects for each of the four scenarios.For the Electricity TYNDP 2022 and beyondRestructure the scenario development process in order to be completed by December of the year before the TYNDP.Involve relevant stakeholders and experts in the development of scenario assumptions.Ensure transparency of scenario development and availability of scenario data. All scenarios should be used in the needs exercise and the CBA analysis in a balanced way, using the premise of economic growth.Early and substantial consultation of the needs methodology (including important parameters like the horizons to be studied, the zones modelling, the climatic years to be used).Define an appropriate starting network for the needs identification. Duly implement the provisions of the TYNDP Inclusion Guidelines - non-compliant projects should be excluded. Consider the impact of the 70% minimum interconnection capacity target in the modelling of the power system, where relevant.Transfer capacities should be calculated for all projects and with more granularity and transparency.Consult the main elements of the TYNDP CBA (e.g. study horizons, criteria for the construction of the reference grid, scope of the CBA) before the inclusion of projects in the future TYNDP.Build the reference grid considered for the CBA analysis, according to the Agency's recommendations. ENTSO-E should extend the study horizons for which a CBA analysis is conducted for the TYNDP 2022 at least to one study year after 2030 (e.g. 2035 or 2040).What is the TYNDP?The main objectives of the TYNDP are to:​identify investment gaps (including cross border capacitiescontribute to a sufficient and non-discriminatory level of cross-border interconnections, the effective competition and the efficient functioning of the market, andensure a greater transparency of the European electricity transmission network.​The TYNDP builds on national investment plans prepared by the transmission system operators (TSOs) and takes into account the regional investment plans, published every two years.Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) are selected from the TYNDP via a separate process led by the European Commission. The TYNDP should provide essential and comprehensive information for the selection of PCIs, in particular through complete, monetised, and reliable cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and assessment of projects.What is the role of ACER and its overall assessment?ACER issues an opinion on the draft network plan developed by network operators taking into account the objectives of non-discrimination, effective competition, and the efficient and secure functioning of the internal electricity market. 	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-finds-serious-shortcomings-in-ENTSOs%E2%80%99-energy-network-plans---electricity.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0017	2021-04-26	EU gas supply sourcing costs fell to record low in 2020 due mainly to COVID-19 gas demand reductions and record LNG deliveries	 Section 1 Body Html​​​​​Average gas supply sourcing costs declined in 2020 in most EU Member States and the Energy Community Contracting Parties by more than 4 Euros/MWh year on year, according to today's preliminary assessment of the EU Agency for the Cooperation for Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Energy Community. When comparing gas sourcing costs in 2020 to their average between 2012-2019, prices declined by 8 Euros/MWh.The assessment measures the average yearly price at which nationwide suppliers can source their wholesale gas. The calculation considers the prices of products traded at the national hubs as well as declared cross-border gas imports and domestically produced gas.The main drivers of the price decline were the demand reduction caused by COVID-19 and the highest-ever liquefied natural gas (LNG) deliveries registered during the first half of 2020. These resulted in historically low EU hub spot prices in the second quarter of 2020. The decline in the prices of other energy commodities and the above average underground storage stocks at the beginning of the injection season were other contributing factors. Even though hub prices partly recovered from the third quarter, average yearly supply sourcing costs reached their record low since ACER started to assess them in 2012.Convergence in sourcing prices remained overall robust amongst a majority of Member States, with the largest differences rounding about 3 Euros/MWh. This demonstrates the benefits of the Internal Gas Market. For example, in 2013 sourcing cost spreads of more than 5 Euros/MWh were frequent, implying extra yearly expenditure from 40 to 60 Euros for the average final household consumers in higher costing gas markets. Increased convergence in gas sourcing cost is estimated to have yielded​ average annual welfare gains in the range of 3 billion Euros for EU gas consumers since 2013.​Source: ACER and Energy Community calculation based on Eurostat Comext, ICIS Heren and National Regulatory Authorities.Note: Gas sourcing cost within a given Member State vary per shipper and supply period, shaped by the features of the various contracts, hedging strategies as well as distinct supply origins. To infer an average yearly gas supply price, the Agency uses a methodology that considers three main types of sourcing costs (see MMR 2015, Annex 6): i) based on an explicit basket of hub products (in markets with sufficient forward transactional activity), ii) based on declared cross-border imports and iii) based on domestic production prices. The map displays the arithmetic average of all sourcing mechanisms; the report will contain the exact price estimates per supply mechanism.Despite the impact of COVID-19 on gas demand and the enhanced availability of liquefied gas, the average gas price did not decline uniformly across the EU. This resulted in some price gaps between the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) hub-based benchmark and the sourcing costs of some Member States. Prices were higher on average at Member States with a higher reliance on long-term supply contracts indexed either to oil or longer-curve' hub products. The highest average sourcing costs were reported in Southern East, Mediterranean and some Central East Member States. All Baltic countries (excluding Finland), and also Greece, reported very price-competitive import prices in 2020. ACER considers that in both cases this is due to the larger relative indexation to hub prompt products in their more recent LNG supply contracts.Sourcing costs at the Energy Community Contracting Parties were uneven, shaped by the characteristics of the diverse markets. In the majority of them, gas prices continued to be somewhat higher than for the average of EU Member States due to a prevalence of less favourable long-term contracts and more limited upstream supply competition. However for example in Ukraine the price gap have lessened following market reforms that have made import prices more correlated with EU hubs. Ukraine retains also ample cost-competitive domestic gas production.In a related exercise, the upcoming 2020 ACER Gas Wholesale Market Monitoring Report will analyse the level of price convergence of spot products traded at EU hubs. The preliminary results indicate a strong price alignment across the North West European region, where price differences against the TTF benchmark remained below 1 Euro/MWh for almost all trading days, as the figure below illustrates. Hub spreads commonly remain below transportation costs despite the gradual expiration of long-term capacity contracts, which is reducing in turn EU shippers' short-run marginal costs bidding (the Market Monitoring Report will analyse this trend in depth). Record liquefied gas deliveries and flexible North Sea supplies, together with the structural fostering of hub trading at the region, are deemed as limiting price decoupling.While hub price convergence tends to be stronger at regional level, Central and South Eastern hubs, as well as Mediterranean and Baltic ones, still show some higher spreads when comparing against the TTF benchmark. Those differences arise because of higher transportation tariffs as well as from the specific interplay of marginal supply and opportunity pricing at the individual markets.  Nonetheless, overall, spot price alignment increased year on year with lower demand combined with high liquefied gas deliveries and storage stocks. The improvement was notable at the Hungarian, Italian and Spanish hubs. For example, unusually, the Italian hub quoted at a discount to the Austrian hub across the summer months, on the grounds of extra liquefied gas deliveries.Sourcing costs and hub price individual assessments will be further examined in the next edition of the Gas Wholesale Market Monitoring Report, to be published in July 2021. Furthermore, the report will focus on presenting the results of the ACER Gas Target Model metrics for the year 2020 as well as on assessing the effects of gas network codes implementation. It will include a new chapter identifying the contributions that the gas sector can make to the EU decarbonisation ambitions. 	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/EU-gas-supply-sourcing-costs-fell-to-record-low-in-2020-due-mainly-to-COVID-19-gas-demand-reductions-and-record-LNG-deliver.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0018	2021-04-16	Gas tariffs reports: ACER recommends Lithuania to better justify domestic tariffs and mechanisms to compensate the discount granted to Klaipėda LNG entry	 Section 1 Body Html​​In its second report on the implementation of the European Union (EU) Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff Structures for Gas in Lithuania, the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) recommends the Lithuanian national regulatory authority for Energy (VERT) to better substantiate that no discrimination is induced by the difference between the two tariffs applied to domestic consumers. The Agency also recommends to provide a description and a justification for the mechanisms used to compensate the discount granted to Klaipėda LNG entry, in accordance with the Network Code to improve the Lithuanian security of supply.VERT proposes a postage stamp reference price methodology (RPM). This RPM should in theory be simple and should lead to equalised domestic and cross-border exit tariffs. VERT however applies several asset-cost splits and a complex mechanism to compensate the discount granted to Klaipėda LNG entry. These additional complexities aim at improving the cost-reflectivity of the tariffs and at limiting cross-subsidies between domestic and cross-border users. They lead to differentiated tariffs among domestic exits and among cross-border exits. The Agency recommends VERT to publish additional information and to clarify the legal base justifying these complexities. VERT shall take a motivated decision by 17 July 2021. Access the report​.Find out more and access all ACER reports on national tariff consultation documents.	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Gas-tariffs-reports-ACER-recommends-Lithuania-to-better-justify-its-domestic-tariffs-and-the-mechanisms-used-to-compensate-.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0020	2021-04-12	ACER to decide on the electricity cross-zonal capacity allocation methodologies for the exchange of balancing capacity in 19 EU Member States	 Section 1 Body Html​The National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) for energy from the Hansa, Core and Baltic regions asked the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) to decide on the respective region's market-based cross-border capacity allocation process.To take an informed decision, ACER is inviting all interested parties to submit their comments by 2 May 2021.​The Hansa region comprises of 5 countries: Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden.The Core region includes 13 countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Croatia, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia.The Baltic region comprehends 6 countries: Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden.Additionally, regulators from the Core region asked ACER to decide on the regional cross-border capacity allocation process to be based on economic efficiency.What are the benefits?The cross-zonal capacity allocation methodologies ensure efficient, transparent, and non-discriminatory capacity allocation for the exchange of balancing capacity or sharing of reserves. The market-based process applies in case the allocation takes place not more than a week in advance of the provision of balancing capacity, while the process based on economic efficiency applies in case the allocation takes place more than one week in advance of the provision of balancing capacity.How does ACER contribute?ACER Decisions will contribute to the integration of the balancing capacity markets by establishing the rules for allocating the cross-border capacity needed to facilitate the balancing capacity procurement at regional level.Among the next steps:​A Decision will be reached per each capacity calculation region (CCR) by:27th July 2021 (Hansa CCR)22nd August 2021 (Core CCR) 26th August 2021 (Baltic CCR)Would you like to learn more about the topic?

ACER_NEWS_0021	2021-03-30	ACER adopted a Decision on the Amendment of the Fallback Procedures of the Core Capacity Calculation Region	 Section 1 Body Html​The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) adopted a Decision on the Amendment of the Fallback Procedures of the Core Capacity Calculation Region (CCR).In December 2020, the National Regulatory Authorities for energy of 13 Members States​ (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia) - the Core CCR - asked ACER to decide on the amendment of the fallback procedures. What are the fallback procedures?In the event that the single day-ahead market coupling process is unable to produce the results of the day-ahead coupling, the fallback procedures of the Core CCR foresee the execution of shadow auctions. Current shadow auctions in the Core CCR are based on the explicit allocation of electricity in the form of Physical Transmission Rights (PTRs). The procedures for these shadow auctions and the requirements for the participation of market participants are laid down in Annex II of this Decision - Shadow Allocation Rules (SARs)​. What are the consequences of this amendment?With the implementation of this new amendment, there will be a change of the publication deadline of the shadow auction results from 13:50 CET to 14:00 CET on the day preceding the electricity delivery. The change of publication deadline is a result of the change in the Single Day Ahead Coupling (SDAC) operational timings in order to allow more time for the price coupling algorithm to calculate day-ahead results and thus alleviating some burden from the algorithm due to its growing performance requirements. These changes will also increase the harmonization of the procedures among the Joint Allocation Office, Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and market participants, as well as reduce the risk of decoupling.Access the Decision No 02-2021.	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-adopted-a-Decision-on-the-Amendment-of-the-Fallback-Procedures-of-the-Core-Capacity-Calculation-Region.aspx

The benchmarking adjustment, which is also a discount, is foreseen for the purpose of levelling the tariffs for competing pipelines. Both adjustments result in an increase of tariffs at other network points, hence a cross-subsidisation effect. The Agency recommends MEKH to better assess the impact of these adjustments. MEKH shall take a decision by 15 June 2021. Access the report.Access all ACE​R reports on national tariff consultation documents.​	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Gas-tariffs-reports-ACER-recommends-Hungary-to-review-the-storage-discounts-and-the-benchmarking-adjustment-.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0024	2021-03-05	ACER calls for improvements to the European Commission’s current TEN-E Regulation legislative proposals to ensure the best projects for the Green Deal and European consumers	 Section 1 Body Html​ACER and CEER have published a position paper on improving the Regulation on Guid​elines for Trans-European Energy Networks (TEN-E Regulation) setting out how Europe's co-legislators can further improve the Commission's legislative proposals.The ACER-CEER position paper (March 2021) calls for neutral and independent technical assessment of infrastructure projects and improved regulatory oversight so that the projects bringing most benefits for the European Green Deal are supported and to avoid any risks of unjustified costs to European consumers.Tackling the infrastructure needs in an increasingly integrated European energy system is complex and requires proper regulatory scrutiny to safeguard the public interest. ACER and national regulators have a long experience in terms of network development for electricity and gas as well as with the implementation of the TEN-E Regulation. In essence, ACER and the regulators focus on 2 main issues:the quality of the tools to assess infrastructure needs and projects' value according to European energy policy objectives, and the role of regulators and the Agency in the governance of the European Projects of Common Interest (PCI) process, ensuring they can effectively oversee TSOs' tasks and decide on projects implementation.By way of background, already In July 2020, regulators set out their recommendation to the European Commission (as it began developing its proposals on revising the Trans-European Energy Networks Regulation) in the ACER​-CEER position paper on revision of the TEN-E Regulation and Infrastructure Governance​. When the European Commission's revised TEN-E Regulation proposals were published in December 2020, ACER and CEER flagged up the need for further improvement for energy network development (see the ACER-CEER Press Release​).With the exception of the introduction of ACER framework guidelines for scenarios development, ACER's role (in the Commission's proposals) is weakened due to the lack of regulatory scrutiny of offshore network development plans and due to the proposal to limit ACER's and NRAs' ability to assess investment requests. In other areas in need of better regulatory oversight, no structural improvements are included.​The ACER-CEER position paper (March 2021) sets out and makes recommendations on 9 main issues:Assessment of projects through CBAs – facilitating infrastructureAssessment of projects in different futures – scenario developmentOffshore grid planning should be fully integrated in the European grid planningCross border investment decisions should be exclusively a competence of the national regulatory authority (NRA) and, where relevant, ACERSpecific provisions on risk-related incentives are not necessarySimplification of Regional GroupsProjects of mutual interestImplications of amended gas project categoriesImplications of the abolition of natural gas projects.​	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-calls-for-improvements-to-the-current-TEN-E-Regulation-legislative-proposals.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0026	2021-02-24	ACER and energy regulators will draft new Framework Guidelines on sector-specific cybersecurity rules for cross-border electricity flows	 Section 1 Body Html​​​​In a push to further implement the EU's cybersecurity strategy, on 28th January 2021, the European Commission invited the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators​ (ACER) to draft Framework Guidelines on the cybersecurity of cross-border electricity flows. These (non-binding) Framework Guidelines developed by ACER and energy regulators, will serve as a basis for the development of the future (binding) cybersecurity network code in electricity.ACER will run a public consultation in spring (April-May) and will submit the Framework Guidelines to the Commission as soon as possible. Europe reinforces cybersecurity in energy-specific legislation and codes​Europe's 2019 Clean Energy laws are a turning point in the way the European Commission deals with cybersecurity in the electricity sector, by integrating cybersecurity directly into electricity sector-specific legislative acts.Both the recast (2019) Electricity Directive and Electricity Regulation have cybersecurity measures. For example, the Directive deals with issues related to cybersecurity requirements for smart metering solutions. The Electricity Regulation provides the legal grounds for a binding EU-wide cybersecurity network code that will complement and further specify existing cybersecurity Regulations and Directives. This new cybersecurity network code are electricity sector-specific rules for cybersecurity covering issues such as automation and data flows related to cross-border electricity flows, common minimum cybersecurity requirements applicable to all actors for the electricity markets as well as planning, monitoring and reporting obligations.  The Electricity Regulation also provides for a cybersecurity role for the new EU entity for Distribution System Operators (EU DSO entity).In developing these sector-specific Framework Guidelines (which lead to binding network codes), ACER is contributing to Europe's bigger strategy on cybersecurity. Visit the ACER and cybersecurity page for more on what cybersecurity is, the rules in energy and how ACER pro-actively contributes to cybersecurity resilience.Stay updated on the latest news, sign up for our Infoflash.​	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-and-energy-regulators-will-draft-new-Framework-Guidelines-on-sector-specific-cybersecurity-rules-for-cross-border-elec.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0028	2021-02-11	Regulatory treatment of Power-to-Gas: second Paper in the ACER/CEER European Green Deal Regulatory White Paper series	" Section 1 Body Html​​The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) publish today a White Paper with recommendations on how to regulate Power-to-Gas facilities​ in the context of a European Integrated Energy System, which is fundamental to implementing successfully the European Green Deal. Power-to-Gas consists of transforming electricity into renewable gases, and thus contributing to optimise the energy system as a whole with renewables.This paper is the second in a new series of ACER/CEER European Green Deal Regulatory White Papers following the publication of the pure hydrogen networks paper earlier this week. The aim is to deepen understanding on the regulatory aspects of Green Deal issues and to assist the European Commission in assessing various options as part of the preparations for legislation on hydrogen and energy system integration.The paper​ provides the following 7 recommendations on regulating power-to-gas facilities:Revisit the current set of definitions for major activities in the context of integrated gas and electricity sectors Consider investment and management of power-to-gas installations as market-based activities which are open to competition among market playersAllow involvement of system operators in the development and operation of power-to-gas installations only in exceptional cases Include power-to-gas installations and their suitable locations in system needs analysisDefine cost-reflective network tariffs, which should be applied to comparable activities across the electricity and gas sectors in a technologically-neutral wayAvoid distortive effects of taxes and levies on the integrated energy systemEnsure traceability of renewable energy throughout the integrated energy system.Background​​Energy System Integration consists of taking advantage of synergies between the various energy carriers (electricity, heat, cold, gas, solid and liquid fuels) and the end-use sectors (buildings, transport, industry) in order to achieve an EU carbon neutrality by 2050.Following the release of the European Commission's European Union Green Deal at the end of 2019, the European Commission issued the Communication “Powering a climate-neutral economy: An EU Strategy for Energy System Integration"" (July 2020), which proposes policy and legislative measures at EU level to​ gradually shape a new integrated energy system.Do you want to know more about Energy System Integration?​​​​​You can consult the related section of ACER's website, which provides an overview on Energy System Integration and on the work in progress of the European Commission, the European Parliament and of ACER.

ACER_NEWS_0029	2021-02-10	ACER reports on electricity distribution tariff methodologies in Europe and recommends how to improve them	" Section 1 Body Html​​ACER has published a report reviewing the methodologies for electricity distribution tariffs in EU Member States​​​​​​.It provides detailed data across EU Member States on what costs are recovered via the distribution tariffs and how the tariffs are designed. It also touches upon how some energy transition activities (e.g. Power-to-X facilities, Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations and energy communities) are treated in the tariff methodologies, which in turn may play a role in their uptake.​Why are distribution network tariffs important?The electricity transmission and distribution networks are the backbone of the energy systems and play a key role in the energy transition. Network tariffs recover the network operators (Transmission System Operators and Distribution System Operators) costs. In order to support overall system efficiency, tariffs should be designed to provide: appropriate incentives to the system operators to build and operate the networks optimally; and  economic signals to network users.The effectiveness of such signals depends on factors such as the type of network user and the share of the network costs in the final bill.How is the electricity distribution tariff design linked to sustainability and the energy transition?Tariffs can be designed in multiple ways. Finding the right balance between various tariff setting principles (e.g. cost recovery, cost reflectivity, efficiency, non-discrimination, transparency, non-distortion, simplicity, stability, predictability and sustainability) is a complex task. As Europe strives to decarbonise its energy system (with a strong focus on electrification, increased renewables and a more active role of network users) the complexities increase. Hence, how distribution tariffs are designed can become increasingly important, but also increasingly complex.What are the main findings and recommendations of the ACER distribution tariffs report? The ACER report provides various recommendations. For example:There should be a common understanding of the term “distribution tariffs"" by differentiating it from other regulated tariffs paid by users connected to the distribution network;The NRA's role in tariff setting should be strengthened;Tariff methodologies should allow stakeholders to reasonably predict the tariff evolution (e.g. ACER recommends a tariff methodology period of at least 4 years, with a yearly update of the tariff values based on the drivers defined by the tariff methodology and on inflation);Transparent and effective stakeholder involvement should be ensured;Transparency in distribution tariff setting should meet at least a minimum standard;A minimum set of distribution cost categories should be differentiated to facilitate comparison;Distortive effects when setting tariffs for injection and for withdrawal should be avoided;Distribution tariff bases should reflect cost drivers;The interaction between price signals of distribution tariffs and other price signals should be paid attention; Different treatment of the same user group should be avoided, unless properly justified.EU legislation requires ACER to issue (and update every 2 years) a best practices report on electricity tariff methodologies. National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) shall duly take the ACER best practice reports on transmission and distribution tariff methodologies into consideration when fixing or approving transmission and distribution tariffs or their methodologies.This is the first electricity distribution tariffs report. It complements the A​CER 2019 report on electricity transmission tariff methodologies. What's next?ACER will hold a webinar on electricity network tariffs on Friday, 19th March."	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-reports-on-electricity-distribution-tariff-methodologies-in-Europe-and-recommends-how-to-improve-them.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0030	2021-02-10	ACER and ENTSOG publish their Joint Policy Paper with recommendations to mitigate misconduct in EU gas balancing markets	" Section 1 Body Html​​​The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG) have jointly published a policy paper with recommendations to mitigate potential misconduct in EU gas balancing markets. This paper incorporates the feedback received in the public consultation held between 21 September and 3 November 2020.This policy paper includes recommendations related to good practices for ex-ante monitoring checks on balancing and creditworthiness, and cross-border exchange of information. It also includes good practices currently implemented for proactive measures and the possibility for reactive measures in case of balancing misconduct identified in another Member State.The policy paper refers to the following key proactive measures to improve the correct functioning of the market:Follow-up the creditworthiness of the network user to ensure that sufficient financial safeguards are available.Implement “Know your customer"" and “due diligence"" policies to screen obviously fraudulent market participants and remove them from the sales ledgers.Exchange of information at a cross border level amongst balancing operators, ACER, national regulatory authorities and ENTSOG to share intelligence early on about misconduct cases.The policy paper equally highlights that reactive measures with immediate outcome to recover the damage caused or stop its proliferation: Notify and/or drawing guarantees of the network user in case of misconduct.Impose partial restriction to the participation of the network user in the market (nominations restrictions, capacity reservation restrictions).​Suspend the network user's contract or the possibility of the withdrawal of licence.The paper will inform the current European regulatory framework on potential amendments to the Balancing Network Code. In particular, the paper underlines of the provisions of the Balancing Network Code on neutrality principles, that effective actions in a proactive and reactive way should take place to prevent losses due to balancing misconduct. The policy document is available on the ACER website. Access the responses of the public consultation​."	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-and-ENTSOG-publish-their-Joint-Policy-Paper-with-recommendations-to-mitigate-misconduct-in-EU-gas-balancing-markets.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0031	2021-02-09	ACER and CEER recommend when and how to regulate pure hydrogen networks	" Section 1 Body Html​​​With the EU goal of becoming a carbon neutral continent by 2050, hydrogen is set to play a key role in decarbonising Europe's economy.  To realise the European Green Deal's ambitions for hydrogen, the right regulatory framework must be created to facilitate a hydrogen economy in a cost-effective way. European energy regulators (ACER and CEER) have published a set of recommendations on when and how to regulate pure hydrogen networks. The need and scope of hydrogen network regulation will depend on its structure and evolution. This paper is the first in our new series of ACER-CEER European Green Deal Regulatory White Papers. This hydrogen paper examines: The circumstances under which regulating hydrogen networks is needed;How to treat existing hydrogen network infrastructure;How to address regulatory challenges related to the repurposing of gas infrastructure for dedicated hydrogen transport. The aim is to deepen understanding on the regulatory aspects of Green Deal issues and to assist the European Commission in assessing various options as part of the preparations for legislation on hydrogen and energy system integration.What do regulators recommend on regulating hydrogen in this ACER/CEER Hydrogen White Paper?ACER-CEER consider that that when establishing the rules for the future hydrogen market, law-makers and regulators can benefit from the well-established European regulatory framework governing the natural gas and electricity markets. Furthermore, a dynamic regulatory approach might be inspired by the model of the existing EU regulation of the telecommunications sector. ACER and CEER recommend consideration of the following 6 issues when regulating hydrogen:Consider a gradual approach to the regulation of hydrogen networks in line with market and infrastructure development for hydrogenApply a dynamic regulatory approach based on periodic market analysis and monitoring Clarify the regulatory principles from the outsetForesee temporary regulatory exemptions for existing and new hydrogen infrastructure developed as business-to-business networks Value the benefits of repurposing gas assets for hydrogen transportApply cost-reflectivity to avoid cross-subsidisation between the gas and hydrogen networks in case of repurposing gas assets​Pure hydrogen network regulation should be introduced gradually, in line with the hydrogen market development. Periodic market monitoring at national level, based on EU-agreed principles, will identify if a pure hydrogen network is likely to become an essential facility: should that be the case, basic regulatory principles will have to apply. ACER and CEER are open to temporary regulatory exemptions, similarly to that allowed under the existing gas and electricity regulatory framework. Exemptions will allow business-to-business networks to operate without unnecessary burdens. In case the specific market circumstances evolve and regulatory exemptions would not ensure a healthy competitive environment, they should be revoked. Re-use of existing assets should be explored prior to any decommissioning. Existing gas pipelines may be repurposed to become pure hydrogen pipelines. The decision on repurposing shall be based on a case-by-case assessment, relying on cost-benefit analyses (CBAs). The CBAs will have to incorporate inputs from both the gas and hydrogen sectors and take into account societal aspects. In terms of planning the repurposing, candidate pipelines should be identified within the National Development Plans (NDPs). In case of repurposing of existing infrastructure, ACER and CEER underline the important principle of cost-reflectivity: users of each network (natural gas or hydrogen) will only pay for the network they use.  For cost-reflectivity and to avoid cross-subsidisation when repurposed, the transfer of gas assets should be valued, as a reference, based on their residual regulated asset value.  BackgroundThis ACER-CEER “When and How to Regulate Hydrogen Networks?"" White Paper aims to deepen the understanding on regulating hydrogen and to assist the European Commission in assessing various options as part of the preparation for a legislation on hydrogen and energy system integration. In this context, ACER commissioned papers, written White Papers (jointly with CEER) and has been organising / participating in a series of events to spread its main findings and regulatory recommendations. ​Find out more how hydrogen can support the decarbonisation of the gas sector.Want to more about hydrogen?​ACER, in partnership with the Energy Community, is hosting a webinar on hydrogen on Thursday 25 February.

ACER_NEWS_0032	2021-01-15	ACER updates its requirements for Registered Reporting Mechanisms and will resume the registration of Registered Reporting Mechanisms	 Section 1 Body Html​​​​In light of the adoption and entry into application of the European Commission's Decision on fees due to ACER for collecting, handling, processing and analysing of information reported under REMIT, ACER has updated its requirements' document for Registered Reporting Mechanisms (RRMs) and will resume their registration. ACER had informed on 20 November 2019 that it unfortunately had to suspend the processing of pending RRM applications due to its resource limitations.The document defines the technical and organisational requirements for submitting data, as only reporting parties who comply with the requirements will be registered by ACER. The update now integrates the latest provisions: the European Commission's Decision foresees an initial enrolment fee for entities applying to become a RRM and a yearly fee for registered RRMs. As a next step, ACER will resume the RRMs' registration and the provision of all necessary services. This would require ACER to process the numerous pending RRM applications, as well as the potential new ones at the same time. ACER will inform stakeholders about the schedules of these activities in future communications.This registration process remains very labour-intensive due to the ongoing lack of human resources, and therefore ACER thanks all RRM applicants for their cooperation and understanding.​	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/REMIT-News-ACER-updates-its-requirements-for-Registered-Reporting-Mechanisms-and-will-resume-the-registration-of-Registered.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0039	2020-12-21	ACER assesses the consistency of national and European gas network plans and their contribution to energy transition	 Section 1 Body Html​​Every other year, ACER carries out a comprehensive review of the National Development Plans (NDPs) assessing their consistency with the EU-wide Ten-Year Network Development Plans (TYNDPs). This ACER review is based on information provided by NRAs, and covers the methodological and project consistency between the most recent NDPs and the draft EU TYNDP 2020.What's​​ in the ACER Review of gas NPDs?ACER's review of NDPs covers, among other ​topics: the certification of  Transmission System Operators (TSOs); type of unbundling models; the consultation process of the plans; the inputs used and resulting outputs; the most recent publications; and methodological aspects such as the use of network, market and sector integrated studies and cost-benefit analysis. What is new in this ACER review is an analysis of whether the energy transition aspects are covered in the gas NDPs. ACER finds that 89% of the NDPs are gas-specific, of which 75% exclude hydrogen and 4 NDPs (15%) include hydrogen.Sector-specific v's cross-sectoral network planningWhilst it is possible for NDPs to cover several energy sectors (e.g. gas, electricity, oil, heat, etc.), ACER finds that currently only 2 countries (Denmark and Spain) have cross-sectoral (electricity and gas) network development plans.National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) support gas NDPs focusing more on green and low-carbon gases, and evolving towards integrated planning with electricity in order to better align network planning with energy transition goals. Consistency of National and European gas network development plansACER has observed that the level of project consistency of national and EU-wide plans is close to 63% and varying per Member State. ACER notes a falling level of project consistency between NDPs and the present draft EU TYNDP 2020 in comparison to the two previous editions of the EU TYNDP. This decrease in project consistency is largely explained by the inclusion in the EU TYNDP 2020 of energy transition projects which are not part of most recent NDPs. ACER RecommendationsACER's Opinion leads to a number of recommendations for improving the consistency of national and European plans, among which:1.    NDPs should be prepared and published in each Member State at least every 2 years.2.   ​Cooperation between operators during the preparation of the NDPs regarding the development of cross-border capacities and other projects with significant cross-border impact should be improved.​ 3.    Proposed investments in NDPs and TYNDPs should carefully reflect the views of network users on the need for capacity expansions. 4.    Project cost data should be included in all national and EU network plans.5.    The sustainability dimension should be more emphasised in gas network planning, for which initiatives and legislative reforms of the network planning framework at national and EU level may be needed. Network plans should focus more on investments allowing green and low-carbon gases to be injected into the networks.The ACER Opinion and its Annexes​ provide comprehensive information on the most recent gas NDPs. 	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-assesses-the-consistency-of-national-and-European-gas-network-plans-and-their-contribution-to-energy-transition.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0040	2020-12-18	ACER’s first 70% target report on the minimum margin available for cross-zonal electricity trade in the EU	" Section 1 Body Html​​​​​What is the minimum 70% cross-zonal electricity capacity target?​​Europe's Clean Energy Package (CEP) has set a binding minimum 70% target for electricity interconnector capacity for cross-zonal trading (the “minimum 70% target""). Why is monitoring the 'minimum 70% Target' important?The lack of sufficient cross-zonal capacity is one of the main barriers to the integration of electricity markets, and market integration is key to deliver on Europe's energy goals. The CEP established a clear rule – namely a minimum capacity margin available for cross-zonal trade (MACZT), the 'minimum 70% target', to be met by all Transmission System Operators (TSOs). The more interconnector capacity that is made available for cross-zonal trade, the more trading that can occur. The minimum 70% target is legally binding  since the start of 2020, but Member States may also adopt transitory measures, such as action plans or derogations, thus allowing TSOs to reach gradually the minimum 70% target, by the end of 2025 at the latest.ACER's monitoring aims to consistently identify the scope for improvement to meet the minimum cross-zonal capacity target, across the EU.  How are Member States doing? Efforts needed in all countries to reach the 70% targetACER's first “70% Target Report"" provides an overview of the current levels of margins for cross-zonal capacity compared to the minimum legally binding 70 % target for the first half of 2020, and on action plans and derogations.ACER's 70% Target Report finds that:Member States have much more to do to get closer to the legally binding minimum 70% target The levels of margins for cross-zonal capacity is mixed across the EU. Member States should work to meet the 70% minimum target at all times, and to reach their target national transitional targets to gradually reach the 70% minimum.How? Members States can count on several measures at their disposal to improve the level of margin offered such as cost-efficient investments; use of remedial actions; and bidding zone reconfiguration, to help them to reach the target. The levels of cross-zonal capacity are very diverse depending on the type of border and geographical location.On high-voltage Direct Current (DC) borders, the 70% target was met most of the time but with a few notable exceptions.On Alternating Current (AC) borders, there is a very diverse picture with significant room for improvement to meet the 70% target for most regions and borders.ACER's monitoring depends critically on TSOs providing robust and extensive data.  ACER acknowledges the efforts made by a majority of TSOs to improve the provision of data. However, the completeness and quality of this data needs to be further improved. Regarding action plans and derogations, ACER finds significant room for further harmonising their setup across the EU. Regulatory authorities should grant derogations as a last resort measure, and only where necessary for maintaining operational security.For consistency, national regulatory authorities (NRAs) should consider the results of ACER's analysis to assess the compliance of TSOs with the minimum 70% target.Access to the ACER's comprehensive Report and detailed Annexes What's next? ACER 70% target webinar: Thursday, 21 January 2021 (10.00 -11.30) - Registration are now open!​"	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER%E2%80%99s-first-70-target-report-on-the-minimum-margin-available-for-cross-zonal-electricity-trade-in-the-EU.aspx

However, a few National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) confirmed that the implementation of some of the requirements of general application is still outstanding or it has differed from the provisions included in the two Network Codes.Similarly, NRAs reported some requirements in the corresponding national grid codes go beyond those laid down in the EU Regulations.In the report, ACER recommends:Not to withhold connection to the network to a prospective system user that complies with all the requirements and capabilities in the Network Codes, in case it is unable to comply with requirements included only in national regulations.NRAs to complete or promote, if empowered to do so, expeditious implementation of the Network Codes where the implementation has not been yet completed. The Network Code on Demand Connection provides harmonised standards for demand facilities connected to the network. The Network Code on Grid Connection of High Voltage Direct Current Systems and Direct Current-Connected Power Park Modules specifies requirements for long distance direct current connections. These are used to link offshore wind parks to mainland or to connect countries over long distancesThe implementation of a harmonised set of provisions facilitates the competitiveness and the market of generation technologies across Europe.Access the Report.	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Network-Codes-on-Demand-Connection-and-on-Requirements-for-HVDC-Systems-and-DC-Connected-Power-Park-Modules-on-track-in-mos.aspx

Tackling the infrastructure needs in an increasingly integrated European energy system is complex and requires proper regulatory scrutiny to safeguard the public interest. The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) welcome the Commission's efforts to modernise the current framework (called “TEN-E"") with a new focus on sustainability in the European Commission's revised TEN-E Regulation proposals, but the process needs to be robust and proper regulatory scrutiny assured.Regulators welcome the new focus on sustainability and the Green DealACER-CEER welcome the new focus on sustainability and offshore renewables including extending the scope of the Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) to include hydrogen and electrolysers. This is a big step towards the Green Deal.Room to further improve the TEN-E process and ensure regulatory oversightWelcoming the proposals, ACER Director, Christian Zinglersen stated: “Massive energy infrastructure investment is needed to deliver on Europe's climate and energy priorities. Tackling infrastructure needs in an increasingly integrated European energy system is bound to be more complex, and requires a range of assets to achieve the decarbonisation targets. Regulators welcome the European Commission's efforts to make the current framework for trans-European energy infrastructure (“TEN-E"") fit for purpose for the energy transition. We welcome that infrastructure “scenario planning"" will become more neutral with the introduction of ACER guidelines. To reach sector integration, the scenario planning should be developed jointly for electricity and gas in a neutral way. The new process for Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) methodologies is overly complicated, and may not fit well with the agility needed for the Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP) and PCI processes which have a 2-year cycle. To ensure proper regulatory scrutiny over the ENTSO's proposals and for simple and timely processes, ACER should be given the powers to approve the methodologies for the CBA and be able to issue binding guidelines. These CBAs are critical to the reliable and consistent assessment of the TYNDP projects and the selection of the European Projects of Common Interest (PCIs). Europe's legislators should not miss this opportunity to streamline the process and improve the regulatory oversight so that the best projects are delivered.""On the national and European network development plans, CEER President, Annegret Groebel, added: “The European regulatory framework needs to be robust for the identification of the cross-border projects and investments needed for the energy transition, and for projects funding and cost allocation to be subject to regulatory oversight by NRAs in line with the principles of the Internal Energy Market /Clean Energy Package frameworks. To ensure coherence of the TYNDP and the national level plans, national regulators should have the power to approve/amend the National Development Plans and oversight over ENTSOs on the TYNDP process needs to be strengthened. Regulators, who are closest to the projects, are best placed to decide on how to allocate the costs of cross-border energy projects in a coordinated way within ACER to support informed and consistent cross-border cost allocation (CBCA) decisions across Europe.  Regulators' recommendations on how to improve the TEN-E Regulation are set out in the ACER-CEER position paper​ on revision of the Trans-European Energy Networks Regulation (TEN-E) and Infrastructure Governance. ​​Access the full ACER-CEER Press Release​."	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Regulators-welcome-the-Commission%E2%80%99s-Trans-European-Networks-for-Energy-(TEN-E)-proposals-but-see-scope-for-further-improvem.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0045	2020-12-14	ACER to decide on the electricity fallback procedures in 13 EU Member States	 Section 1 Body Html​​​​The National​ Regulatory Authorities for energy  in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia – the so called Core region - asked the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) to decide on their fallback procedures.Fallback procedures ensure efficient, transparent, and non-discriminatory capacity allocation in case the single day-ahead algorithm is unable to produce results on the day-ahead auction. ACER Decision will contribute to increase the procedural harmonization across various market parties and change the operational timing for the publication of the shadow auction results, therefore reducing the risk of decoupling.

ACER_NEWS_0048	2020-12-08	Electricity Regulatory Forum: ACER welcomes discussion on the relevance of the Clean Energy Package implementation	" Section 1 Body Html​The European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) welcomed the valuable discussions at the Electricity Regulatory Forum (#FlorenceForum), held on 7-8 December 2020. The Forum emphasised the critical importance of Clean Energy Package implementation as a key pillar to addressing the challenges of the European Green Deal at lower cost. The Forum, organised by the European Commission, brings together Members States, regulators and industry.Clean Energy Package -  not yet doneIn his key messages on the Green Deal to the Forum, ACER Director, Christian Zinglersen said: “While a lot of progress has been achieved in the electricity sector over the last 10 years, the temptation is sometimes high to move on as attention shifts to new and important challenges, we should not fall for this trap to “tick the box"" on electricity market integration. It is not done yet!' Green Deal issues such as the new off shore wind strategy are underpinned by technical work.  Key issues addressed at this Florence Forum included:bidding zone configurationthe 70% cross-zonal target for interconnectorsresource adequacy cyber security TSO-DSO cooperation flexibilityBidding ZonesACER emphasised the necessity of an unbiased, sound, technical and neutral bidding zone review.Resource Adequacy and Capacity MechanismsThe Forum sees that a well-functioning market should be the first approach to ensure adequacy before introducing a capacity mechanism and for this purpose, the market reform plans have to be implemented in a timely manner by the Member States.ACER in close collaboration with ENTSO-E, took the first steps this year in developing and adopting methodologies underpinning future European-wide resource adequacy assessments, informing the assessment done nationally. Effective cross-border participation in capacity mechanisms shouldReflect actual contributions to resource adequacyEnsure non-discrimination between domestic and foreign capacity providersProvide efficient signals for investment and operationsCapacity Allocation and Congestion Management (CACM) amendmentsACER will consult stakeholders on the scope of the amendments for the ACER recommendation on CACM.70% Cross- Zonal CapacityCalling for Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to make more interconnector capacity available for cross-zonal trade (as per the minimum 70% target), ACER provided a glimpse into its upcoming 70% Report (to be published before year end). Most TSOs made a noticeable effort to provide extensive and accurate data. Data is still an issue for the Nordic and Baltic regions (no data at all) and for Italy North and in France. On DC borders, the 70% target was fulfilled most of the time with few substantial exceptions whereas on AC borders there is significant room for improvement.ACER welcomes that CEP implementation remains the priority in the next yearsACER remains fully committed to this implementation process and, in close coordination with NRAs, to minimising potential delays. In that respect, the following ACER's deliverables will represent key milestones to the market integration process:The implementation of the ACER's decisions on the European resources adequacy assessment The implementation of the ACER's decision on the methodology for the bidding zone review The implementation of the ACER's decisions on cost-sharing of redispatching and countertrading for the Core and SEE regionsThe forthcoming ACER's special edition report on the 70% target ​ACER is also committed to taking its full part to the network codes and guidelines' amendment process.

ACER_NEWS_0052	2020-11-26	ACER to decide on the definition of capacity calculation regions	 Section 1 Body Html​The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) have received a proposal from all Transmission System Operators (TSOs) for the definition of capacity calculation regions. This proposal envisages all European Union's bidding zone borders to be grouped into different capacity calculation regions, taking into consideration the interdependencies between their cross-zonal capacities. Different regional methodologies (such as capacity calculation, re-dispatching and countertrading) will be applied on the various capacity calculation regions.An effective coordination between bidding zone borders allows an optimal use of transmission infrastructure across Europe, resulting in positive welfare gains for consumers. These benefits are often determined on the level of capacity calculation regions and the applications of their respective regional methodologies, which is why an efficient determination of the capacity calculation regions is of significant importance to the internal electricity market. ACER must reach a Decision by 9th May 2021.	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-to-decide-on-the-definition-of-capacity-calculation-regions-.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0054	2020-11-18	ACER rejects the long-term capacity calculation methodology for the Baltic Capacity Calculation Region	 Section 1 Body Html​​​​​The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) published today its ​Decision on the rejection of the capacity calculation methodology for the long-term timeframe of the Baltic capacity calculation region (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Finland and Sweden) in accordance with Article 10 of the Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/1719 establishing a Guideline on Forward Capacity Allocation (FCA Regulation).In May 2020, ACER was informed by the regulatory authorities of the Baltic capacity calculation region (CCR) that they could not agree on the proposal made by the Nordic Transmission System Operators (TSOs) for a capacity calculation methodology for the long-term timeframe, and is therefore competent to decide on this proposal.ACER has decided to reject the proposal and to request the Baltic TSOs to resubmit a new one at the latest 24 months after its decision. The main reason for this rejection is that ACER is not able to revise the Baltic TSOs' proposal to make it compliant with the​​ FCA Regulation given the number and complexity of issues related to the upcoming synchronisation of the Baltic synchronous area with the Continental synchronous area.Read more on ACER Decision No 27/2020. ​	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-rejects-the-long-term-capacity-calculation-methodology-for-the-Baltic-Capacity-Calculation-Region.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0055	2020-11-17	ACER consults to revise gas tariffs formation for short-term capacity	 Section 1 Body Html​The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) launches today a public consultation to assess the possibility of setting a cap for multipliers for day-ahead and within-day capacity products. Multipliers are used to set tariffs for short-term gas transmission capacity products and can affect the balance between short term and long term contracted capacity.The Network code on Harmonised transmission tariff structures for gas sets out that the level for day-ahead and within-day multipliers for standard capacity products shall be no less than 1 and no more than 3. Lower multipliers applied to short-term capacity products can incentivise shorter-term capacity bookings while higher multipliers on those products can incentivise longer-term capacity bookings. The Network Code also provides the possibility for the Agency to issue a recommendation to cap day-ahead and within-day multipliers to 1.5. The objective of this consultation is to gather views and information from stakeholders on the impact of day-ahead and within-day multipliers in order to assess the possibility of publishing a recommendation to limit the level of day-ahead and within-day multipliers.The Agency invites stakeholders to provide their views on the impact of day-ahead and within-day multipliers in order to assess the possibility of publishing a recommendation to limit the level of day-ahead and within-day multipliers.ACER seeks comments of interested stakeholders on the impact of multipliers on market integration.

ACER_NEWS_0058	2020-10-26	Energy bills continue to be very different across EU Member States	" Section 1 Body Html​The prices consumers pay for their energy increased and continue to be very different across the EU. Compared to 2009, average electricity household prices in 2019 increased significantly, faster than inflation. The existence of regulated prices in some Member States can limit the entry of new suppliers and reduce consumer choice. Such choice will be important to enable consumers to unlock cost savings in their energy bills where possible, particularly when some of the non-contestable aspects (network, taxes, levies) may increase in the future to deliver decarbonisation.For consumers to be able to shop around for better prices and services, smart meters and reliable comparison tools are essential. However, the presence of these continues to vary across Member States, albeit with improvement in recent years. Market concentration levels continue to improve, but too slowly, with electricity markets performing better than gas markets. It is worth reflecting on the impact that COVID-19 is currently having on the energy sector, prompting a variety of responses from national regulatory authorities, mainly geared towards protecting energy supply for consumers.These are some of the findings in the latest edition of the Energy Retail and Consumer Protection Volum​e​ of the annual report on the results of monitoring the internal electricity and gas markets in 2019 (MMR), published today by the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER). The report includes two other already-published volumes analysing the electricity and gas wholesale markets. ACER and CEER develop the MMR with the support of the Energy Community Secretariat.  All volumes can be found here.Join us for a joint ACER/CEER webinar to present the results of the latest MMR results at 10:30 CET on 28 October.How did retail energy prices perform in 2019?The report shows that average energy prices in 2019 increased for energy consumers, with the exception of average industrial gas prices, which recorded a decrease. The analysis also shows that the difference between wholesale and retail prices widened in 2019. A strong correlation between retail and wholesale energy prices is observed when wholesale energy prices increase. However, a weaker correlation is noted with regard to a fall in retail prices following a fall in wholesale energy prices. Such “sticky prices"" can result in energy consumers paying higher than needed prices for their energy consumption. While it is not expected that retail prices will always decrease at the same rate as wholesale price reductions, empowering energy consumers may assist in placing downward pressure on suppliers to decrease retail prices. How can consumers be further engaged to find the best prices?The Clean energy for all Europeans package recognises the important role that European energy consumers will play in achieving decarbonisation goals. At present, consumer engagement in retail energy markets is limited in some MS due to the presence of regulated prices. As these MS move to market-based prices, the energy consumer will have a wider choice of retail suppliers. The rate of consumers switching suppliers ranges from 1% to 20% across the EU. As regulated prices are phased out, it is expected that consumer participation will increase. However, consumers need to have the right tools allowing them to make informed decisions. For example, smart meters provide consumers with real-time information on their energy consumption, enabling their active participation in the market. However, a full smart meter roll-out has been completed only in nine MS. Meanwhile, comparison tools, which help consumers find the best offer for their needs, exist in 20 and 15 MSs for electricity and gas, respectively. The report notes that millions of complaints were filed by consumers to their suppliers (and distribution system operators, DSOs) in 2019, most often regarding invoicing issues to their suppliers and metering-related issues to their DSOs."	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Energy-bills-continue-to-be-very-different-across-EU-Member-States.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0059	2020-10-21	Electricity wholesale markets continue to integrate in the EU but cross-border capacity is limited	 Section 1 Body Html​​​Electricity price convergence in the EU increased signalling a further integration of electricity wholesale markets; however, the amount of cross-border capacity available for trade among Member States remains insufficient to meet the minimum EU target of 70%. These are some findings of the Electricity Wholesale Markets Volume of the latest report on the results of monitoring the internal electricity and gas markets (MMR) published today by the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER). The report also finds that several Member States continue to use national capacity mechanisms – policy instruments to ensure the necessary level of resource adequacy – even if they do not always face an adequacy problem. The research covers 2019, but it also includes a preliminary assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on electricity markets.  The latest edition of the MMR consists of three volumes: Electricity Wholesale; Gas Wholesale; and a combined volume including Retail Markets and Consumer Protection, to be published on 26 October. All volumes can be found here. ACER and CEER develop the MMR with the support of the Energy Community Secretariat. ​You can register for a webinar with our experts on the latest MMR results at 10:30 CET on 28 October​.Mixed picture: progress and delaysOn the one hand, some progress was observed in several aspects of market integration. For example, in 2019, prices converged fully almost 50% of the time in the so-called Central-West Europe region, including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxemburg and the Netherlands. Moreover, thanks to the integration of day-ahead markets, cross-border capacity was used efficiently during all hours on more than two thirds of EU borders. On the other hand, the extension of the flow-based market coupling project to Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia in the so-called Core region has been facing recurrent delays. Accomplishing market coupling in all market timeframes across EU borders would render additional welfare benefits of more than 1.5 billion euros per year.How is COVID-19 affecting the EU electricity markets? Electricity demand dropped by 7% in the first half of 2020 compared to 2019 and prices decreased in all EU markets. Despite the pandemic, market integration continued. For example, thanks to the intraday market integration project, intraday liquidity increased by more than 25% compared to the same period of 2019. The use of renewable energy accounted for 40% of the generation mix in the EU in the first half of 2020 and for the first time surpassed the share of fossil fuels in the generation mix.Some of the main challenges: A more coordinated approach to ensure security of supply and sufficient cross-border capacityElectricity systems are facing unprecedented changes, and achieving the desired levels of security of supply at a low cost for end-consumers is essential. Capacity mechanisms remain in several Member States with a total cost of 3.9 billion euros, representing a 73% increase in 2019 compared to 2018. ACER acknowledges that these mechanisms may contribute to ensuring security of supply but recommends that Member States implement them based on a robust and coordinated resource adequacy assessment.Another remarkable challenge refers to the amount of cross-border capacity available for trade, which continues to be insufficient. ACER will soon publish a dedicated report on the issue, in view of the 70% capacity target envisaged in the Clean Energy Package (CEP), covering the first semester of 2020. The CEP offers a portfolio of instruments to achieve the 70% target. In the short term, Member States may opt for transitory measures, such as derogations or action plans, apply remedial actions like redispatching and countertrading, or improve the configuration of bidding zones. In the long term, Member States may expand or reinforce networks. In this respect, ACER is currently involved in two of these instruments. In particular, ACER is in the process of approving a number of regional methodologies for coordinated redispatching and countertrading and is assessing the methodology, assumptions and alternative bidding zone configurations to be considered for the bidding zone review. ​	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Electricity-wholesale-markets-continue-to-integrate-in-the-EU-but-cross-border-capacity-is-limited.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0066	2020-09-24	Most trans-European energy projects allocate costs on a territorial basis, decisions appear to be taken to enable EU grants	" Section 1 Body Html​​​Most Cross-Border Cost Allocation Decisions (CBCA) for trans-European energy infrastructure are based on the so-called territorial principle so each country covers the project costs on its territory without cross-border compensation payments, according to the Fourt​h​ Monitoring Report on CBCA decisions published today by the European Union Age​ncy for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). The Agency also finds that these decisions have a strong link with requests for EU funding for works under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programme aimed at promoting growth through infrastructure.What is a CBCA Decision?​Based on a cost-benefit analysis, CBCA decisions may lead to cost sharing between countries which significantly benefit from the PCIs. For example, one or more net benefiting countries provide compensation payments to one or more countries showing a net negative impact from the project implementation (cost bearers). In practice, however, as the report shows, most decisions follow the so-called territorial principle.​​Main findings of the report:​Only 21% of the CBCA decisions establish cross-border payments between the hosting countries or deviate from the traditional approach in some other way.​Strong link found between CBCA decisions and requests for EU funding for works under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programme. 90% of electricity and 57% of gas projects for which a CBCA decision was taken until June 2019 -deadline for the last concluded CEF call- were awarded grant for works. The number of CBCAs has become balanced between gas and electricity after an initial prevalence of gas projects.75% of the CBCA decisions are concluded for projects located in the Baltic region and between EU Member States in Central and Eastern Europe.NRAs reached agreements in all cases except two, which were referred to ACER.In terms of participation, the NRAs from Latvia (10), Estonia (7), Lithuania (7), Poland (5), Bulgaria (4), France (4) and Romania (4) have been involved the most in CBCA decisions.​The future of CBCAsCBCA decisions may play a more important role for implementing cross-border projects in the years to come. More electricity interconnections will be needed to facilitate the integration of increased renewable power generation in view of decarbonisation objectives, such as the deployment of vast offshore wind generation capacity. These developments may result not only in step-change in electricity infrastructure rollout, but also in a less territorial approach to cost allocation, especially in case many Member States become “transit countries"" as opposed to “off-take countries"".In gas, retrofitted interconnections could enable a pan-European market for decarbonised gases like hydrogen and support the integration of more renewable energy. Robust and reliable cost-benefit analyses are needed to inform decision-makers on the distribution of expected benefits across borders.The ACER-CEER Position on the Revision of the TEN-E Regulation and infrastructure governance reflects on the use of CBCA decisions so far and contains proposals for improving the relationship between the CBCA and the CEF, among others, by reconsidering their mandatory link.​​"	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Most-trans-European-energy-projects-allocate-costs-on-a-territorial-basis,-decisions-appear-to-be-taken-to-enable-EU-g.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0067	2020-09-23	ACER finds EU gas market rules successful and recommends decarbonisation to be built on current market design	 Section 1 Body Html​​​​​Common rules governing gas transportation systems have contributed over the last five years to more competition and better prices in the EU according to the Gas Wholesale Volume​​ of the latest Annual Report on the result​s of monitoring the internal electricity and natural gas markets (MMR) published today by the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of E​nergy Regulators (ACER). In this volume the Agency also recommends that any upgrading of rules aimed at decarbonising the gas sector be built on the current EU market design.This year there will be two other volumes of the MMR analysing the markets in 2019: an Electricity Wholesale market volume and a combined volume including Retail markets and Consumer protection both to be published in mid-October. The MMR is developed in cooperation with the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) and increasingly with the Energy Community Secretariat. All volumes will be published he​re​​.​The EU gas market rules are workingGas market monitoring results show that the common rules governing access and operation of EU gas transportation systems – the Gas Network codes - have contributed to high levels of gas price integration between EU Member States, increased supply side competition and helped create liquid wholesale markets over the period of the last five years.As a result, big gas companies have less market power and more EU gas consumers can benefit from increased competition and lower prices. To safeguard these developments the Agency recommends that the adaptation of Gas Network codes is made more dynamic, so that the market framework can be adjusted in response to evolving market conditions.  The MMR also shows that the presence of increasingly liquid hubs and the large EU regasification and storage capacities are attracting global LNG suppliers to Europe. In an oversupplied market record LNG deliveries arriving from the Middle East, the US and Russia drove down the gas price to record lows in 2019 saving 29 billion euros according to data from the European Commission. Maintaining competition between suppliers from outside of the EU will grow in importance in the coming years as domestic gas production in Member States continues to decrease while gas consumption has been growing in recent years.Decarbonising together at EU levelNew supply of carbon neutral gas could contribute decisively to the EU climate strategy, with the added benefit of further rebalancing the current market power asymmetry between European gas buyers and third-country suppliers. However, monitoring results show that today, carbon neutral gases account for a relatively minor share of EU gas consumption at around 4%, predominantly biogas, which is mostly not injected into the gas grid, and are far from being competitive at current prices.Given the framework of The European Green Deal, particularly the increasing ambitions for reducing emissions by 2030 as well as the resources that have been earmarked for climate projects as part of the EU recovery plan, the low uptake of carbon neutral gases will need to accelerate. Therefore, the Agency recommends that any upgrading of internal gas market rules aimed at decarbonising the sector be built on foundations of the current market design, so that the transition to carbon neutral gas does not lead to market fragmentation along national borders and keeps the significant benefits for consumers in place. The data underlying the Market Monitoring Report is available here. Access the gas wholesale volume.​​​​Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on gas wholesale markets in the EUThe analyses in this report are mostly based on data from 2019 and do not yet fully take into account the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, preliminary analysis by the Agency shows that lockdowns which governments had enacted to control the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a severe drop of energy consumption throughout the EU. Gas demand, which fell by 8% compared to the previous year up to May 2020, has yet to return to pre-lockdown levels though demand has picked-up since the beginning of the summer.Some trends which had started in 2019 have further accelerated: EU hub prices plummeted to new record lows (in June spot prices on the reference TTF hub in the Netherlands were down by 52% compared to the previous year and 77% lower when compared to June 2018); hub trading activity, supported by additional hedging needs, rose by more than a fifth up to June 2020 compared with the same period last year; and record volumes of gas are being held in storage.​ 	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-finds-EU-gas-market-rules-successful-and-recommends-decarbonisation-to-be-built-on-current-market-design.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0070	2020-09-01	ACER assesses that most long-term contracts for gas transportation in Europe will expire in the next ten years	" Section 1 Body Html​The ACER Market Monitoring Report finds that, compared to the end of 2019, 20% of EU gas transportation legacy contracts' volume will expire by the end of this year, while 60% will expire in 2028 and almost all legacy capacity will cease to exist by 2035. This implies that much more capacity will become available for the market, with bookings depending more than in the past on market conditions.Capacity rights are split according to the way and moment the capacity was purchased: acquired before the EU implementation of the Capacity Allocation Mechanisms"" (CAM) network code (legacy contracts) or after that (CAM contracts or other contracts). Legacy contracts were booked according to non-EU harmonised rules.The latest Market Monitoring Report, which will be published at the end of September, includes a 30-years-overview of the progressive expiration of EU gas transportation network capacity rights starting from 2016.  The chart below shows how sharp the decline in long-term legacy contracts is in the years ahead (the blue bars) as well as the situation as of the end of 2019 of new long-term capacity bookings (the yellow and orange bars). ​​While the volumes of legacy contracts will not change until their full expiry, the amount of new bookings will change because new capacity will progressively be booked. Evolution of EU transportation capacity booked by capacity type (2016-2045) - TWh/day​Source: ACER based on ENTSOG.Note: Includes all EU interconnection points' sides directions, also with third countries, which are in the scope of the EU regulation on transportation capacity allocation (CAM Network Code). From 2020, the new products' categories only include volumes allocated in auctions held until 31/12/2019. The legacy capacity for 2020 has been interpolated in the absence of data. *The category “more capacity open season bookings*"" includes specifically the long-term capacity allocated in 2017 via auctions in an ad-hoc open season for two interconnection points located along the routes for further transport from Nord Stream II: Lubmin II and Deutschneudorf-EUGAL. This capacity was assigned before the incremental capacity amendments to the CAM Network Code entered in place. The trend is to book short-termSince the implementation of the EU capacity allocation mechanisms network code prescribing standardised bundled products sold through open auctions, the market trend is to book shorter-term capacity products (up to one-year ahead), with limited volumes booked for longer durations. Given the current global gas markets conditions, network users seek to pursue as much flexibility as possible, while avoiding lock-in effects. This is possible since capacity hoarding through long-term contracts has become much more difficult.This leads to a lower degree of concentration in new capacity contracts compared to legacy capacity contracts, as the former tend to attract additional market participants seeking prompt supply optimisation, thus increasing competition. However, the bookings' degree of concentration of new capacity contracts increases at some specific interconnection points and mainly for the longer-term ones. The reduced interest of EU shippers in new long-term bookings is leading to a rise in the share of upstream producers in such bookings. New long-term bookings are located in a few Member StatesThe new European long-term capacity contracts are concentrated in a few, and relatively big, interconnection points, mainly related to the Nord Stream pipelines and to the routes for further transport from there (in Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia), as shown in the chart below. EU Member States' volumes of longer-term capacity booked from 2016 (2020 – 2039) – Average TWh/day ​ Source: ACER calculation based on GSA, PRISMA, RBP.Notes: Volume of incremental capacity could be included in the allocated auctioned volumes. “Other"" includes the other 14 MSs where CAM NC is implemented. “Germany - OS"" and “Czech Republic – OS"" includes specifically the long-term capacity allocated in 2017 via auctions in an ad-hoc open season for two interconnection points located along the routes for further transport from Nord Stream: Lubmin II and Deutschneudorf-EUGAL.

ACER_NEWS_0072	2020-08-17	ACER publishes four decisions creating a Nordic electricity balancing capacity market	 Section 1 Body Html​The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) publishes today four decisions​ in line with the EU Regulation establishing a Guideline on Electricity Balancing, creating a single Nordic Balancing capacity market for the procurement and exchange of automatic frequency restoration reserves. By procuring balancing capacity, TSOs acquire the option to activate a generation or demand facility to balancing the electricity system in real time. By organising this common procurement and exchange of balancing capacity, the Nordic TSOs increase competition between providers reducing the overall cost for TSOs. Decision 22-2020 establishes a market-based allocation process of cross-zonal capacity for the exchange of balancing capacity. Particularly, the methodology regulates the amount of cross-zonal capacity to be made available for the exchange of balancing capacity. This allocation is based on a forecast of the day ahead (DA) market prices’ differences and actual balancing capacity bids. Decision 21-2020 establishes a methodology for the application of an allocation process of cross-zonal capacity for the exchange of balancing capacity. This methodology allows Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to apply the first methodology in procurement process of balancing capacity defined in the third decision. This decision defines the pre-conditions when TSOs are allowed to start exchanging balancing capacity which – most notably - is that cross-zonal capacity needs to be calculated pursuant the approved Nordic CCM methodology for the DA timeframe. Decision 19-2020 sets out harmonised rules for the procurement and exchange of balancing capacity. This methodology implements the common procurement of balancing capacity for the automatic Frequency Restoration Reserves (aFRR) on the Nordic LFC Block.Decision 20-2020 decides on the exemption to TSOs for not allowing balancing service providers to transfer their obligations to provided balancing capacity. This exemption allows TSOs to only allow transfer of balancing capacity after the procurement process within bidding zones but not across bidding zones borders. ​​Access the decisions​.	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-four-decisions-creating-a-Nordic-electricity-balancing-capacity-market-.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0076	2020-07-23	ACER finds no market interest to invest in gas network expansion	 Section 1 Body Html​​Market players are not interested in expanding gas networks in the European Union (EU) according to a report published today by the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). To achieve better-integrated gas markets the EU introduced in 2017 a process to identify every two years the market demand for incremental capacity by Transmission System Operators (TSOs). ACER has analysed the related projects initiated in the first biennium and included an update on virtual interconnection points for a better management of cross-border gas capacity. The Incremental capacity projects serve to expand efficiently network capacity in a market-based way where market players commit to buying capacity to demonstrate the economic viability of the project. None of the projects fulfilling the criteria of the process attracted sufficient commitments to pass the economic test that determines their economic viability. ​The lack of interest indicates that market participants deem that the current capacity addresses their future needs. “In view of the Green Deal -aiming at making Europe climate neutral by 2050- it will be even more important to base capacity expansion of the gas ne​​twork on robust identification of market needs”, ACER highlights in the report.  Virtual Interconnection PointsThe Report also gives an update on virtual interconnection points, which simplify the entry-exit model by reducing the number of physical points where capacity between two markets can be booked, instead offering capacity products at a single point. The number of virtual points have increased greatly since the first ACER report on the matter in 2016: from three operational virtual points back then to 16 of them throughout Europe. Further virtual interconnection points may be established at the borders of the EU and neighbouring countries such as Ukraine, where the application is voluntary. Access the report.	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-finds-no-market-interest-to-invest-in-gas-network-expansion.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0078	2020-07-16	ACER publishes three decisions harmonising the EU balancing market for electricity	 Section 1 Body Html​The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) publishes today three decisions in line with the EU Regulation establishing a Guideline on Electricity Balancing, harmonising the imbalance settlement and fostering a single EU balancing market.The first decision concerns the methodology for classifying the activation purposes of balancing energy bids. The methodology provides the description and rules for all possible activation purposes, providing the same level of transparency when activating balancing energy bids across Europe.​The second ​establishes the methodology for Transmission System Operators (TSOs)' common settlement rules for all intended exchanges. This should ensure the pricing principles for the settlement between balancing service providers and TSOs are also respected among TSOs.​The third decides on the methodology to further specify and harmonise the imbalance settlement. The imbalance settlement ensures the costs of any shortage or surplus of electricity, bought or sold as balancing energy by each TSO, is allocated to the market participants that caused the imbalance. In case of a surplus, the market participant that supports the system should receive a payment. The new methodology ensures a consistent application of the imbalance settlement process across Member States. Applying these rules across Europe ensures that market participants are incentivised to deliver on the electricity they have bought or sold. This increases the overall efficiency of the electricity system to the benefit of the end consumers.Access ​the Decisions.	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-three-decisions-harmonising-the-EU-balancing-market-for-electricity.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0082	2020-07-10	Most EU gas transportation networks not yet ready to transport hydrogen	 Section 1 Body Html​​For the European Union (EU) to be climate neutral by 2050, gas networks will have to be gradually adapted to carry green gases such as biomethane and hydrogen. 23 national regulatory authorities (NRAs) have looked into the current possibilities for admixing hydrogen and injecting biomethane or transporting pure hydrogen via existing gas networks, as well as network adaptations to allow this in the future and reported via a survey to the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). The results show that 65% of the responding NRAs reported that the transmission system operators (TSOs) do not accept the injection or allow hydrogen volumes into the gas transmission network yet. The report ​on this fact-finding survey is published today, following the unveiling of the EU Hydrogen Strategy by the European Commission earlier this week.  The survey also included questions on national strategies on hydrogen, technical and regulatory aspects, specific projects and investments needed. Main findings:The readiness of gas transmission networks to accept hydrogen or biomethane is very diverse across the EU.In most cases, developments are at an early stage, driven mainly by pilot projects. Most national regulators would support an EU-wide approach for setting hydrogen admixing limits, in pursuit of cross-border gas trading and market integration. Pure hydrogen networks could be built in parallel with the blending of hydrogen in the existing networks, depending on the specific market and network situation. Gas quality standards may need to be revised at EU level to ensure interoperability between Member States.Regardless of the actual choice of a hydrogen concentration limit, some network adaptations and selected investments will be needed. These investments will deserve greater attention in gas network development plans.​It seems that blending of hydrogen would not initially require major changes in the current market design and legislation.ACER and national regulators will continue working together in exploring and applying regulatory options for this to happen in the most efficient way and to the benefit of all energy consumers. Access the Report.	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Most-EU-gas-transportation-networks-not-yet-ready-to-transport-hydrogen-.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0083	2020-07-09	Building trans-European energy infrastructure: ACER reports delays but less project rescheduling	" Section 1 Body Html​The implementation of the Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) for Trans-European Energy Infrastructure continues experiencing delays - 38% for gas and 27% for electricity projects - according to the latest consolidated report published today by the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). However, voluntary rescheduling has decreased significantly, suggesting a more robust PCIs list.  The investment costs of all projects amount to €90 billion.​​​The sixth edition of the ACER annual report on the progress of Projects of Common Interest for trans-European Energy Infrastructure reviews the fourth list of PCIs, published biennially. This list, presented in October by the European Commission, identifies the most important projects interconnecting electricity, gas and smart grids networks across the EU, so that these projects can benefit from simplified permitting and the right to apply for EU funding from the Connecting Europe Facility.Were projects ready to get on the list?Among the 106 projects for electricity and 32 for gas included in the list, ACER often finds a dichotomy between two strategic objectives: getting on the list, which makes a given  project eligible for quick implementation and grants, and getting the project ready in terms of quality planning, permitting, and securing non-subsidised financing. Some project promoters are concentrating on the pursuit of the first at the expense of the second.Promoters of gas PCIs should adapt to the evolution the EU gas sector is facing. Particularly, the economic recovery plans will provide better chances to sustainable, future-proof and “shovel-ready"" projects. Project promoters should also expect that regulators and other decision-makers may wish to insist on specific preconditions in terms of project maturity and proper risk mitigation - including compliance to long-term climate goals -, before seriously considering to finance a project. ACER and CEER have recently published a joint position paper ahead of the upcoming revision of the Trans-European Energy Networks Regulation (TEN-E Regulation). Among other topics, the paper highlights the importance of ensuring that sustainability is taken into account sufficiently for new gas infrastructure projects, as well improving the governance arrangements with respect to energy infrastructure investments.Find out more in the PCI​ Report.​"	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Building-trans-European-energy-infrastructure-ACER-reports-delays-but-less-project-rescheduling.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0084	2020-07-08	ACER consults on cross-border participation in capacity mechanisms	 Section 1 Body Html​The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) has launched today a public consultation to decide on the rules for cross-border participation in capacity mechanisms. These rules enable electricity providers to directly contribute with their resources to security of electricity supply in other European Member States, and to receive payments for their contributions.Mandated by the Clean Energy Package, these rules reflect the benefits of having a truly integrated and pan-European energy market, where electricity resources can be shared between the countries in the most efficient manner, regardless of their location.The rules, developed by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) pursuant to Article 26(11) of recast Electricity Regulation and submitted to ACER for approval, consist of:a methodology for calculating the maximum entry capacity available for cross-border participation in capacity mechanisms. This will define the overall volume of foreign electricity that a country could avail of in meeting its future electricity needs,a methodology for sharing the revenues from selling entry capacity to electricity providers,rules for checking whether electricity providers are available when they are needed by another country,rules for determining when electricity providers are subject to penalties,rules for a registry which would include data on all electricity providers which intend to participate in capacity mechanisms in other  countries, andrules to determine the conditions that electricity providers would need to meet in order to be placed on the registry.To inform our decision, ACER seeks views from all the interested parties during a four-week public consultation, until​ 9 August 2020.Access​ the consultation.Read ACER's Public Notice informing about the initiation of this procedure.​	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-consults-on-cross-border-participation-in-capacity-mechanisms.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0092	2020-05-20	ACER reports on congestion in EU gas markets and how it is managed	" Section 1 Body HtmlThe European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) publishes today the 7th edition of its Report on “contractual congestion in EU gas markets and how it is managed"". Contractual congestion may signal a reduction of market efficiency. It happens when some network users were not able to obtain the capacity product of their choice and had to rely on congestion-mitigating measures to access the gas market. 7th Congestion Report Technical Annex to the 7th Congestion Report ​​The report's main findings​How much congestion? ​In 2019, congestion has increased compared to previous years (37 IP sides in 2019 compared to 31 IP sides in 2018). Most congestion is due to auction premia, which primarily occurred in the auctions of quarterly capacity products.Has any progress been registered? While the number of congested IP sides remains relatively low, local contractual congestion can be severe and reduce market efficiency. About 40% of congested IP sides in 2019 have been found congested before. Much less capacity was made available via secondary capacity trading and or as interruptible capacity at congested IP sides than the amount of capacity that has been unsuccessfully requested by network users in primary auctions of firm capacity products. What comes next? Transmission System Operators ('TSOs') can apply a number of congestion management procedures ('CMPs') to ensure network users can access the network even when they could not obtain some capacity products in the primary capacity auctions. The Oversubscription mechanism remains the most applied CMP, whereas capacities made available via FDA UIOLI and Surrender mechanisms dropped significantly.About half of the congested IP sides are already covered by the FDA UIOLI mechanism, while for the other half the respective National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) need to take action in line with the European Commission's rules on congestion. ACER's main recommendations to the European Commission and to ENTSOG/TSOsThe EC may revise the CMP Guidelines to enhance the effectiveness of the measures. ENTSOG and TSOs should continue improving data reliability to ensure the accuracy of information available at the ENTSOG Transparency Platform. ACER's call on researchers​​The Congestion Report has a narrow scope of analysis, while a substantial amount of congestion data is available for deeper and broader analysis. The Agency shares suggestions for further research and calls on researchers to use the substantial amount of available data to study different aspects of congestion in EU gas markets.ACER offers paid traineeship combining the onsite work experience and the possibility of contributing to the research on congestion, together with our ACER experts.

ACER_NEWS_0093	2020-05-19	EU gas supply sourcing costs fall in 2019 as prices are pressured by record LNG deliveries	 Section 1 Body Html​According to ACER's preliminary assessment, gas supply sourcing costs in most EU Member States (MSs) fell by more than 3 euros/MWh in 2019 compared with 2018. The assessment considers prices of hub traded products, declared imports and domestically produced gas.Record deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) driven by international gas market dynamics, robust pipeline imports from Russia and Norway, and gas storages that had already been well stocked at the beginning of the injection season were some of the major contributing factors to EU hub's spot prices dropping to ten years' lows in 2019. This translated into much lower sourcing costs, even in MSs that do not directly import LNG, as gas flows were directed from low to high price markets. The process has been facilitated by the market design put in place by the third energy package and further refined by gas network codes. Convergence in sourcing cost remained robust in 2019 among the majority of MSs. However, as gas prices did not fall simultaneously and to the same extent across all countries, there were some gas markets where the gap between their and the benchmark sourcing costs based on Title Transfer Facility (TTF) prices grew bigger than in recent years. This gap was largest for less integrated and diversified markets, where reliance on long-term contracts (LTCs) has remained high (prices of oil-indexed LTCs and hub prices tend to diverge in periods of hub price volatility, as the former do not necessarily respond to gas market developments).Source: ACER calculation based on Eurostat Comext, ICIS Heren and NRAs. See MMR 2015, Annex 6 for details on the general methodology and specific data used for selected MSs. Generally, the combination of marginal supply and market opportunity pricing explains the enduring sourcing cost differences between some MSs. Both are in turn affected by factors like competition, transportation costs, predominant sourcing mechanisms and market structure. Price differences may also appear between the various sourcing mechanisms within a country. These aspects will be further examined in the next edition of the Gas Wholesale volume ​o​​f the Market Monitoring Report​, which will be published in September. The report will also contain the exact price estimates per MS and gas supply sourcing mechanism. Overall, in 2019 selected Central-East, South-South-East and Mediterranean MSs showed the highest prices, while most liquid Continental hubs, chiefly those more exposed to LNG, exhibited the cheapest ones.In 2020, sourcing costs are likely to again fall, with the economic slowdown caused by the Coronavirus health crises depressing energy demand and prices. 	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/EU-gas-supply-sourcing-costs-fall-in-2019-as-prices-are-pressured-by-record-LNG-deliveries.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0095	2020-05-12	ACER provides its first Opinion on a bidirectional gas capacity Decision	" Section 1 Body Html​The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) publishes today its Opinion​ on the elements of the Decision to grant an exemption from the obligation to enable permanent physical bi-directional capacity at the ""Deutschneudorf EUGAL ""cross-border interconnection point (IP), between Germany and the Czech Republic. The Decision was taken by Bundesnetzagentur, Germany's National Regulatory Authority and grants the exemption for a period of four years.ACER assessed the elements of the Decision in view of the SoS Regulation and concluded that the Decision generally follows the requirements. ACER found the infrastructure standard indicators foreseen in the SoS Regulation to be already at adequate levels in Germany, in the Czech Republic and in Poland. ACER also notes the existence of available, but unexploited, permanent bi-directional capacity from the Czech Republic to Germany at the nearby Brandov virtual IP. Adding capacity from the Czech Republic to Germany in the short- to medium-term may result in considerable investment costs, which are likely to outweigh the prospective benefits for security of gas supply. ACER further notes that the request for the exemption does not include some key elements for taking a well-informed Decision: such as feasibility study, cost-benefit analysis carried out pursuant to the relevant methodology (foreseen by Regulation (EU) 347/2013), and a meaningful consultation process by the transmission system operators. The Decision could have also included options for monitoring the adequacy level of gas security of supply standards in the longer term, after two years. ACER builds its Opinion on a technical analysis of the available SoS indicators and capacities provided by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC). ACER's Opinion is submitted to the EC for possible further action, and to all competent authorities and national regulatory authorities concerned. Access the Opinion at this link​."	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-provides-its-first-Opinion-on-a-bidirectional-gas-capacity-Decision.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0096	2020-05-08	ACER assesses the draft guideline for cost benefit analysis of electricity grid development projects	 Section 1 Body Html​The Agency published today an Op​inion on the 3rd draft guideline for cost benefit analysis (CBA guideline) of grid development projects, including Projects of Common Interest for trans-European energy infrastructure. The guideline appertains to the proposed methodology by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), which will be applied to the preparation of the Union-wide ten-year network development plan and is updated and improved regularly.In addition to allowing the consistent assessment of transmission and storage projects, including potential Projects of Common Interest in the European Union, the CBA guideline is also used to develop Cross Border Cost Allocation decisions of national regulators, and by Transmission System Operators when developing their national project assessment methodologies.The Agency’s Opinion notes improvements including more transparency, clarity and better analysis of some benefits. However, important shortcomings are identified, such as the need for better alignment with the gas CBA methodology, the need to provide benefit calculations for more study years, the lack of concrete criteria for the construction of the Reference Network, the subjectivity of the assessment of benefits when based on promoters analysis, and the lack of concrete methodologies for the assessment of some benefits.   The Agency urges ENTSO-E to adapt the draft CBA Guideline so it is in line with the considerations included in the ACER Opinion before submitting it to the European Commission for approval. ​​Access the Opinion her​e​.  	https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-assesses-the-draft-guideline-for-cost-benefit-analysis-of-electricity-grid-development-projects.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0006	2020-02-18	Decarbonising the power sector: ACER provides further guidance on CO2 emission limits	" ​​Soon after the European Commission announced a roadmap for the European Green Deal, the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) released its first Opinion covering the topic of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The Opinion provided technical guidance on the calculation of CO2 emission limits in the framework of Capacity Mechanisms. Today, ACER complements that work with a paper providing examples of calculation for different types of production units.These examples range from non-trivial applications of supplementary firing, district heating, co-firing and multi-shaft combined cycle turbines, to the case of a coal-fired generation unit participating in a strategic reserve scheme.ACER's coordination with National Regulatory Authorities and capacity providers to implement CO2 emission limits is part of the overall increased leading role of ACER “to support the EU in achieving its climate objectives"", as underlined by ACER Director Christian Zinglersen in his introductory statement to the European Parliament.Background​In 2019 ACER received a mandate for providing technical guidance on the calculation of CO2 emission limits in the framework of Capacity Mechanisms. Following intensive consultation with interested stakeholders, ACER's Opinion - published in December 2019 - has singled out the principles for a comprehensive, harmonised approach to calculate emission limits at EU level.CO2 emission limits will contain the environmental impact of Capacity Mechanisms by allocating capacity remuneration to generation capacity with lower carbon intensity: an essential tool to move towards the achievement of EU climate objectives.DocumentsYou can access the ACER Paper providing Examples of Calculation for CO2 emission limits here.You can access the ACER Opinion here​.​"	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Decarbonising-the-power-sector-ACER-provides-further-guidance-on-CO2-emission-limits-.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0007	2020-02-03	ACER strengthens rules governing electricity market coupling	 ​ACER publishes today a decision amending the rules which define how Nominated Electricity Market Operators calculate the results of the electricity market coupling in the day-ahead and intraday timeframe as well as the products that market participants can use in these two markets.As regards the market coupling in the day-ahead timeframe, the amended rules adopted by ACER provide stronger requirements and rules for market operators to expand day-ahead coupling to additional Member States and to incorporate advanced features such as the flow-based capacity calculation and 15-minute products. In the context of intraday coupling, new intraday auctions will complement the continuous trading model that is currently implemented within the cross-border intraday (XBID) project. By the end of 2022, three intraday auctions will be performed on a daily basis. These are expected to better allocate scarce interconnector capacities and provide market participants with more opportunities to cross-border trade in the intraday timeframe. This will also contribute to further integrate renewable energy sources. ACER also defined the products that market participants will be able to use in these auctions.

They are also obliged to report UK REMIT data to ACER as specified in the REMIT Implementing Regulation and the ACER guidance.There is no indication that the transition period will be extended. Therefore, as of January 2021 UK market participants willing to continue entering into transactions or placing orders to trade in the European Union's wholesale energy markets will have to register in one of the remaining 27 EU Member States. In the coming eleven months, ACER will continue monitoring the application of EU law to/in the UK and will closely monitor developments in preparation for the end of the transition period. ACER will also engage and provide input as necessary with/to the European Commission.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-update-on-Brexit-implications-for-REMIT.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0009	2020-01-28	ACER adopts decisions towards a single EU electricity balancing market	 ​The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) published today three decisions on the framework for implementation of EU-wide trading platforms for electricity balancing, which will effectively integrate all national balancing markets into one single EU electricity balancing market.A common balancing market will allow EU Member States to share the resources used by their transmission system operators to make generation equal demand. This should help increase security of supply, limit carbon emissions and diminish costs to customers.Two of the ACER decisions govern the electricity balancing from frequency restoration reserves with manual activation (mFRR) and with automatic activation (aFRR). A third decision establishes a harmonised methodology on pricing of balancing energy.Following the ACER decisions, Transmission System Operators (TSOs) will establish two common European trading platforms that will enable all balancing energy bids to compete at EU level and thereby promote competition across EU Member States.The bids for upward or downward balancing energy from balancing service providers across the EU will be available on these two platforms and all TSOs will be able to balance their national transmission systems by activating the cheapest bids available. This will enable TSOs to balance their systems in a more cost-efficient and secure way. The harmonised methodology to price balancing energy will support the establishment of common platforms. All balancing energy bids traded through the platform will receive a marginal price equal to the price of the bid that clears the market. This is a significant step forward as currently most TSOs use pay-as-bid pricing. Marginal pricing provides efficient price signals for existing balancing service providers and for potential new investors.You can access the Decisions he​re. ​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-adopts-decisions-towards-a-single-EU-electricity-balancing-market.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0010	2020-01-10	ACER updates validation rules under REMIT	 ​The Agency is continuously working on improving data reporting guidance to facilitate market participants' (MPs) compliance with their reporting obligations under the Regulation on wholesale market integrity and transparency (REMIT). In order to do so, new validation rules on gas and electricity transportation data will be implemented. Similarly, to other data types, the rules will require that the reported Energy Identification Code (EIC) type X which is used to identify a market participant in the reported data is registered in the Centralised European Register of Market Participants (CEREMP). The Agency has already publicly communicated the issue of 'reporting of inactive, wrong, non-existent and not registered EIC X codes in fundamental and transportation data' in its 2nd Open Letter on REMIT data quality on 19 July 2018. The Agency would like to urge market participants once again to ensure the usage of only one EIC X code when entering into transactions that are reportable according to the REMIT Regulation. The same EIC X code must be registered in CEREMP. MPs should ensure their compliance with the above-mentioned rules by 30 June 2020. The Agency intends to activate validation rules in the second half of 2020, the exact date will be communicated in due time. Upon the activation of the rule, all reported records containing EIC codes as identifiers of MPs that are not present in the CEREMP will be rejected. By the time the validation rule enters into force, the Agency will have provided more than two years for MPs to ensure their compliance with the EIC code reporting.​The Agency will communicate the non-compliant codes reported during Q1-Q3 2019 to Registered Reporting Mechanisms (RRMs) and National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) to further facilitate MPs' compliance by June 2020. The Agency would also like to remind MPs that all EIC codes used for REMIT reporting are considered international and as such should be published on the list managed by the central issuing office (ENTSO-E).About REMITREMIT introduced a sector-specific legal framework for the monitoring of wholesale energy markets. The objective is to detect and to deter market manipulation. Energy trading is screened at EU level to uncover abuses. Market integrity and transparency are essential for well-functioning energy markets and for promoting the confidence of market participants and final consumers.​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-updates-validation-rules-under-REMIT.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0014	2019-12-23	ACER analyses national methodologies for electricity transmission tariffs in the EU	 The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) released today a report reviewing the status of methodologies for electricity transmission tariffs in the European Union Member States. This report​ is a contribution towards the Clean Energy Package objective to increase transparency and comparability in tariff-setting. The report also presents the findings of ACER's monitoring of transmission charges paid by producers. The status review of the distribution tariff structures and the identification of best tariff practices will be subject to future ACER reports. Find below the main findings in different areas.Methodology settingIn all but three jurisdictions/countries the corresponding National Regulatory Authority (NRA) directly sets the transmission tariff methodology or approves a proposal by the transmission system operator. Tariff stability and predictability are pursued when setting transmission tariffs; in most jurisdictions countries, the tariff methodology is set for multiple years (frequently four or five).In all but five countries a public consultation is carried out before the transmission tariff methodology is set, in others at least some key stakeholders are consulted. The information on fundamental tariff elements is usually publicly available.Application of tariffs ​About half of the jurisdictions apply transmission tariffs for injection, beyond the transmission tariffs for withdrawal, which apply in all jurisdictions. The share of costs paid by producers ranges from around 2% up to 35%, depending on the jurisdiction. Full or partial exemptions from the transmission tariffs apply in a few jurisdictions to some network users such as small-capacity producers, energy storage facilities and lower-voltage level connected users.Injection charges have only an energy component in half of the jurisdictions, while in four jurisdictions an additional power-based or a lump sum component is also applied. Three jurisdictions have a capacity-based injection charge. The withdrawal charges mostly have an energy-based and a power-based component. Few jurisdictions apply a pure energy-based charge and one jurisdiction has a charge with a power based and a lump sum component.Costs categories can be recovered by a single transmission tariff or by a combination of different charges. ACER notes that this variety of tariff structures, including the different perimeters of the transmission tariff, makes the comparison of transmission tariffs in Europe a difficult task, where distinguishing at least between network tariffs and charges for system services would be helpful.Economic signals embedded in tariffsIn about 40% of the jurisdictions time signals are embedded in transmission tariffs, mostly in the withdrawal charges. Several time signal types (seasonal, day and night, peak, dynamic pricing) often coexist. In about 20% of the jurisdictions locational signals are incorporated in transmission tariffs, frequently both in the injection charges and in the withdrawal charges.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-analyses-national-methodologies-for-electricity-transmission-tariffs-in-the-EU.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0015	2019-12-19	Capacity mechanisms: ACER publishes technical guidance for CO2 emission limits	 ​The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) published today an Opinion providing technical guidance on the calculation of the CO2 emission limits in generation capacity, in the frame of Capacity Mechanisms as mandated by the European Union's revised Electricity Regulation established this year.The opinion follows intensive consultation with interested stakeholders, including regulatory authorities, capacity providers and transmission system operators.In case of resource adequacy concerns, Capacity Mechanisms are temporary measures taken by EU Member States to ensure that electricity supply can match demand, in times of expected system stress. Acting as a safety net for EU decarbonisation objectives, CO2 emission limits will contain the environmental impact of capacity mechanisms, by filtering out generation units with high carbon intensity. In this context, the Agency's Opinion lays the foundation for a harmonised introduction of emission limits for generation capacity to participate in Capacity Mechanisms: an essential tool to limit the impact of Capacity Mechanisms on EU climate objectives.After setting out the scope of application of the emission limits, the technical guidance introduces a formula for the calculation of the limits and debates key topics of the future electricity systems, including demand side response, carbon capture and storage.Specifications are also provided for generation units that already report their emissions under the EU ETS framework, for which a streamlined process is suggested. Another technical document will be released in early 2020, in order to address specific cases of application of the emission limits and provide stakeholders with calculation examples.Access the Opinion here.The Evaluation of Responses to the Public Consultation is available here.​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Capacity-mechanisms-ACER-publishes-technical-guidance-for-CO2-emission-limits.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0017	2019-12-16	ACER publishes its annual monitoring report on the Inter-Transmission System Operator Compensation mechanism	 ​The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) released today its Report on the implementation of the Inter-Transmission System Operator Compensation (ITC) mechanism in 2018.According to EU legislation, ACER annually reviews the implementation of this mechanism and the management of the ITC Fund established by ENTSO-E for the purpose of compensating Transmission System Operators for the costs incurred on national transmission systems due to hosting cross-border flows of electricity.The Agency notes in its latest report that the ITC Fund remained relatively stable compared to 2017, amounting to €256.5 million. The volume of losses due to transit, after a significant 20% increase from 2016 to 2017, decreased by 13.7% from 2017 to 2018. In parallel, the weighted average value of losses increased by 14% from 35.36 €/MWh to 40.25 €/MWh, which reversed the trend of a gradual decrease of this value since 2012. In 2018, the transmission system use fee paid by non-ITC Parties for their scheduled imports from and scheduled exports to the ITC Parties' networks (i.e. Perimeter countries' fee) increased to 0.6 €/MWh and the contribution of the Perimeter countries to the ITC Fund increased to 5.8% (compared to 0.5 €/MWh and 4.6% in 2017).

ACER_NEWS_0022	2019-11-20	ACER suspends processing of pending applications for registration of REMIT reporting parties	 ​A level of resources incommensurate to its demanding workload, particularly with regard to its activities under the Regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT) has finally forced the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) to suspend, with immediate effect, the processing of the pending applications for registration of reporting parties as Registered Reporting Mechanisms (RRMs).In order to maintain an acceptable level of operational standards in its REMIT implementation, in the last few years the Agency had carried out a wide-ranging re-prioritisation of its activities with regard to data reporting to limit the impact on the continuous collection, management and sharing of high-quality data under REMIT in the most efficient and effective way with the human resources available. ACER has currently registered 120 reporting parties as RRMs, reporting more than 3 million records of transactions on average per day. Any further registration of RRMs would go beyond the number of registered reporting parties expected in the European Commission's legislative proposal for REMIT. The number of registered RRMs is already exceeding by far the number of approved reporting mechanisms in other European and national transaction reporting regimes. ACER is nevertheless still faced with a number of new applications for the registration as RRMs, but it lacks the human resources to process these applications. In ACER's view, there is a limited need for the registration of additional RRMs as the more than 14,000 Market Participants registered with National Regulatory Authorities can already choose among the 120 registered RRMs, including third-party RRMs providing reporting services to Market Participants, to report on their behalf. The Agency may resume the processing of applications as soon as the necessary additional resources become available.​​​​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-suspends-processing-of-pending-applications-for-registration-of-REMIT-reporting-parties.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0023	2019-11-19	Energy Regulators recommend legislative and regulatory action to support the decarbonisation of Europe’s energy sector	" ​In their Bridge Beyond 2025 Conclusions Paper, the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) recommend updating Europe's gas sector legislation and future-proof regulation to facilitate decarbonisation of the energy sector, to promote a competitive Internal Energy Market and to maximise the opportunities arising from sector coupling.The Clean Energy Package (CEP) sets the path to decarbonise the electricity sector. This joint ACER-CEER Conclusions Paper, entitled “The Bridge Beyond 2025"", proposes legislative action (beyond the CEP) to decarbonise the gas sector, and for electricity and gas sector coupling beyond 2025.The Bridge Beyond 2025 Conclusions Paper, which will be presented on 20 November at an event (also live-streamed) in Brussels, follows extensive public consultation by ACER and CEER. The ACER public consultation focused on issues the gas sector faces in the future and a CEER public consultation on regulatory challenges for a sustainable gas sector. The conclusions cover decarbonisation, competition, flexibility and sustainability, as well as the role of ACER and national regulatory authorities (NRAs). Flexibility for decarbonisationACER and CEER believe an updated gas legislation should define and categorise decarbonised gases and integrate them into existing gas markets, with full valuation of their environmental benefits. It should also provide regulatory predictability to enable the emergence of new gases and technologies. The Conclusions Paper recommends new investments in natural gas to be assessed in line with the EU decarbonisation targets and that existing assets are evaluated for possible re-use - following consultation with neighbouring authorities and stakeholders - before decommissioning.ACER and CEER recommend the establishment of a system of dynamic and targeted regulation based on the Gas Target Model (GTM) and the Agency's market monitoring, as well as the analysis of NRAs. The updated legislation, the ACER-CEER Conclusions Paper says, ""should also facilitate new assets and activities, including a sandbox model at EU level for pilot, small scale projects and appropriate differentiation between competitive and monopoly activities"".Increasing competition and fighting fraudACER and CEER recommend that a technology-neutral level playing field is established between different conversion and storage facilities so that they face equivalent treatment of costs, and equivalent recognition of environmental and security of supply benefits. For infrastructure planning, the improvements in network code governance introduced in the CEP for electricity are needed in the gas sector as well, in particular better regulatory oversight over entities which may have an interest in promoting infrastructure investments. With regard to tariffs, both regulators and stakeholders find that, at present, “tariff design does not appear to be causing major issues at a pan-EU level. However, legislative changes can unlock better regulatory tools to address barriers to trade"", the Conclusions Paper notes.Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and NRAs currently face difficulties to act in an effective and timely manner to deal with fraud. ACER and CEER propose several ex-ante measures, which can contribute to mitigating the risk of fraudulent behaviour. See the Bridge Beyond 2025 Paper for further details on the status, challenges and proposed regulatory responses across four themes:Theme A: access and market monitoring;Theme B: governance of infrastructure and oversight of existing and new entities;Theme C: dynamic regulation for new activities and technologies;Theme D: transmission tariffs and cross-border capacity allocation.The Agency's input is based on ACER Recommendation No 02/2019 on the regulatory response to the future challenges emerging from developments in the internal gas market.Note: in the morning of the same day, ACER and CEER present the annual Market Monitoring Report, providing an overview of key data and developments in the state of internal electricity and natural gas markets.

ACER_NEWS_0024	2019-11-11	Electricity wholesale markets: important efforts needed to meet the cross-zonal capacity target established by the Clean Energy Package	 ​​The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) published today the Electricity Wh​olesale Markets Volume​ of the 2018 Market Monitoring Report. Among the main findings, the Report notes that the margin available for cross-zonal trade was on many bidding-zone borders much lower than the minimum 70% target established by the Clean Energy Package. Important efforts to meet this minimum target that will apply from 1 January 2020 are needed.The Report also shows that the average day-ahead elec​​tricity prices increased in all European bidding-zones in 2018, with the exception of the Romanian market. Significant average price differentials were also observed on several European borders (more than 10 euros/MWh in nine borders). This finding suggests that there is room for further price convergence, provided it is cost-efficient.Market coupling contributed to maintaining a high level of efficiency in the usage of available cross-border capacity in the day-ahead timeframe, reaching 87% in 2018. However, a few issues still need to be tackled to finalise the completion of single day-ahead coupling; namely the implementation of a flow-based market coupling for the whole of the Core region, and the integration of the various market coupling projects still coexisting in Europe.​Several Member States also continue to have in place, or plan to establish, a capacity mechanism, whereas a number of them do not seem to face an adequacy problem in either 2020 or 2025. The related costs in 2018 reached 2.5 billion euros in Europe and are foreseen to increase in the coming years. You can find all volumes of the latest edition here.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Electricity-wholesale-markets-important-efforts-needed-to-meet-the-cross-zonal-capacity-target-established-by-the-Clean-Ene.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0027	2019-11-04	ACER organises a public workshop on three electricity balancing decisions	 ​The European Union (EU) Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) opens registration today for a public workshop scheduled on 13 November in Brussels. The workshop will focus on three decisions according to the EU Regulation on Electricity Balancing to provide common rules across Member States:In part I the pricing methodology for balancing energy and cross-zonal capacity will be discussed. This methodology provides the rules for the efficient pricing of the balancing energy that results from bids activation and of the cross-zonal capacity used for the exchange of balancing energy. Part II of the workshop will focus on the implementation framework for establishing a European platform for the exchange of balancing energy from frequency restoration reserves with automatic activation (aFRR). Part III will be dedicated to the implementation framework for establishing a European platform for the exchange of balancing energy from frequency restoration reserves with manual activation (m​FRR). All interested parties are invited to register here by 11 November 2019. ​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-public-workshop-on-three-electricity-balancing-decisions.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0028	2019-11-04	ACER approves amendments to the harmonised allocation rules for cross-border transmission in electricity	 ​The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) published today its decision on amendments to the harmonised allocation rules for long-term cross-border transmission rights in electricity on the basis of the EU Regulation on Forward Capacity Allocation.Before the first ACER decision on this matter in 2017, there were multiple allocation rules across the EU. The objective of the common rules is promoting effective long‐term cross‐border trade by developing a level‐playing field across Europe. Among other provisions, the common rules set out the rights and obligations of registered participants, as well as the requirements for participation in auctions.

ACER_NEWS_0029	2019-10-30	Household bills rise, reflecting wholesale prices in the EU	" ​Contrary to the previous two years, in 2018 the average energy prices paid by final consumers in the European Union (EU) increased by 3.5% for gas and 1.9% for electricity. The rise reflects an increase in wholesale prices. More than a third of European energy consumes have smart meters, empowering them to play an active role in energy markets and to benefit from greater choice and flexibility.​These are among the key findings presented in the latest Annual Report on the Results of Monitoring the Internal Electricity and Natural Gas Markets. This often-called “Market Monitoring Report"" (MMR​) is made up of four volumes of which two covering Retail Markets and Consumer Protection and Empowerment, are released today. The Gas Wholesale Market Volume is already published. The fourth Volume, covering the Wholesale Electricity market, will be published next month. The MMR is produced by the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) in collaboration with the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) and with input from the Energy Community.  For some metrics, the Contracting Parties of the Energy Community are also included in the analysis. Beyond presenting the key results of our assessment of the functioning of the Internal Energy Market (IEM) in 2018, the MMR also contains recommendations on how to address the remaining identified barriers to the completion of the IEM.The energy component is one of the main price drivers of the increase in the energy billThe energy bill is made of four main elements: the energy component and three so-called non-contestable charges: grid costs, renewables support and taxes. With the non-contestable elements stabilising in the last few years, the energy component seems to be the main driver for price variation in the electricity and gas markets. Differences among EU Member States persist though, and the link between retail and wholesale prices is still weak in some countries. The MMR also shows that mark-ups, which assess the level of responsiveness of retail energy prices to changes in prices on wholesale markets - for electricity remain, on average, stable, whereas for gas they trended slightly downwards in 2018 compared to 2017. Among the EU neighbours in South East Europe and the Black Sea region – the Energy Community Contracting Parties - electricity and gas prices for households also rose and contrary to the EU, industrial prices were higher than household prices.  Smart meters empower consumers Up to 35% of European retail electricity consumers have smart meters - Estonia, Italy, Finland, Norway, Spain and Sweden have reached 80% - and, by 2023, more than 72% of EU consumers are expected to have them. Smart meters allow for innovative service offerings, such as time-of-usage contracts with intraday energy prices differentiation available in 16 Member States. Such ongoing innovation increases the active role of energy consumers as foreseen in the European Commission's Clean Energy Package.New in this edition of the MMR is a focus on energy poverty as more and more European countries have set a definition for energy poverty so they can develop measures to address it. People affected by energy poverty in the EU ranges from 4% to 14% depending on the Member State.Market Monitoring Report (MMR) Presentation Event The full set of MMR, including the remaining Electricity Wholesale Market Volume, will be presented at an event on 20 November in Brussels (register here). "	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Household-bills-rise,-reflecting-wholesale-prices-in-the-EU.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0032	2019-10-17	ACER approves the compliance programme of the single gas balancing operator in Belgium and Luxembourg	 The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) published today its decision approving the compliance programme of the gas balancing operator Balansys SA., which is owned in equal shares by the Belgian and Luxembourgish Transmission System Operators (TSOs). ACER's approval is a key element in the further integration of the balancing markets of Belgium and Luxembourg.ACER's analysis showed that the compliance programme contained sufficient guarantees to exclude possible discriminatory and anticompetitive conduct on the part of Balansys. Critical elements that merited particular attention in the decision were Balansys' degree of reliance on the parent TSOs as well as its decision making process and the independence criteria of its key staff.Due to the nature of the tasks being delegated to Balansys, the decision also closely examines the responsibility of the delegating TSOs and the delegated entity. It concludes that, in the current case, the parent TSOs and Balansys are concurrently liable and responsible for the good performance of the delegated balancing tasks. In addition, the decision accepts that the compliance programme criteria and objectives as laid down in the Gas Directive also apply to a joint undertaking of an ownership unbundled TSO and an exempted vertically integrated TSO.

ACER_NEWS_0033	2019-10-04	Gas wholesale markets representing up to 80% of EU gas consumption are working well	 According to the latest Gas Wholesale Market Volume of the annual Market Monitoring Report (MMR) of the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), well-functioning European gas hubs in Member States representing 80% of EU gas consumption are driving the continued improvement of the internal gas market. However, progress in some of the least developed national gas markets in the EU, remains limited.The MMR volumes covering electricity wholesale markets, retail markets and consumer empowerment will be published at the end of October.The latest Gas Wholesale Market Volume​ covering developments in 2018 shows that the divergence between the most liquid hubs – mainly in the North and West of Europe - and the less developed hubs  persists, mainly due to the different level of implementation of the Third Energy Package, in particular of the gas network codes, and to the presence of specific barriers to trading in some Member States. In addition, while spot liquidity is increasing in most countries, forward liquidity seems to be concentrated especially at the TTF hub, the natural gas virtual trading point in the Netherlands, and, to a lesser extent, at the NBP hub in the United Kingdom.The Gas Wholesale Market Volume also shows that in 2018 the differences in gas supply sourcing costs across Member States were in most cases below 1 euro/MWh, highlighting increased competition in the market across Europe, which brings tangible benefits to consumers.  ​The Volume also contains an in-depth assessment of the market effects of gas network codes, which, among others, shows that gas network users are taking advantage of new transmission capacity allocation rules to profile their capacity bookings. This, in turn, gives them the flexibility to respond more effectively to changing fundamentals and market conditions. This is true in particular for North West European and neighbouring gas wholesale markets.This year’s Volume also includes an assessment of the likely effects of the implementation of the gas network code on harmonised transmission tariff structures, which shows that the flexibility provided by the network code implies that some level of tariff competition among Member States will remain. Access the ACER Market Monitoring Report 2018 - Gas Wholesa​​le Markets Volume​.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Gas-wholesale-markets-representing-up-to-80-of-EU-gas-consumption-are-working-well-.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0035	2019-09-27	New Director of the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators designated	" The Administrative Board of the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) has designated Mr Christian Zinglersen as Director of the Agency. The designation took place yesterday and it followed a favourable opinion from the Board of Regulators. Before appointment, Mr Christian Zinglersen will be invited to make a statement before the competent committee of the European Parliament. His term of office is five years (renewable once for up to five years) as of 1 January 2020.  Mr Zinglersen is currently the first Head of the global Clean Energy Ministerial Secretariat hosted at the International Energy Agency in Paris (IEA). He previously served as Deputy Permanent Secretary at the Danish Ministry of Energy, Utilities, and Climate, where he was a member of the Ministry's Executive Board responsible inter alia for the energy policy portfolio. He served as the Danish government's representative and Vice-Chair of the IEA's Governing Board and was the Danish participant in the Director-General meetings on energy policy within the European Union. Prior to that he served as the Danish government's head of the global climate negotiations, culminating in Denmark's Presidency of the Council of the EU in 2012. Mr Zinglersen started his career in the Danish Foreign Service where he focused on EU policy and law, having been posted to Brussels at the Danish Permanent Representation to the European Union. For a number of years he taught Union law at the University of Copenhagen. He holds a Master's Degree in Law from the University of Copenhagen and is a graduate of IESE Business School's Advanced Management Program and Harvard Kennedy School's Senior Managers in Government program. He is married to Christina, a dentist, with whom he has four children.The Chair of the Administrative Board, Dr Romana Jordan, stated: “The Administrative Board warmly welcomes the designation of Mr Zinglersen as Director of the Agency. He is called to act in the interest of the Union and his role will be crucial to ensure the fulfilment of the Agency's growing mandate following the Clean Energy Package for all Europeans and its effectiveness in contributing to the development and evolution of the internal energy market given the increase of cross border flows and the rise of energy production from renewables which pose new challenges and call for stronger integration at a time of budgetary constraints for the Agency"".The Chair of the Board of Regulators, Ms Clara Poletti, stated: “Mr Zinglersen can count on the full support of National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), who lie at the heart of the Agency's structure and whose contribution is vital for the Agency's work. With the implementation of the new Clean Energy Package framework, the Agency will play an even more prominent role in European energy regulation. In this context we look forward to working with the new Director towards an even stronger cooperation of regulatory authorities within the Agency, delivering benefits to consumers across the Union"".Mr Christian Zinglersen will succeed Mr Alberto Pototschnig, the first Director of the Agency, who has been instrumental in establishing and leading the Agency over the last nine years and in delivering on its extensive and growing mandate. Thanks to his pioneering work and leadership as well as the key contribution of the 28 NRAs, the Agency's success has been widely recognised.​Access the Press Release​."	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/New-Director-of-the-European-Union-Agency-for-the-Cooperation-of-Energy-Regulators-designated.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0040	2019-08-09	ACER issues a Recommendation for implementing the 70% minimum margin of capacity available for cross border trade in electricity	 ​The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) published today a Recommendation on the implementation of the 70% minimum margin to be made available for cross-border trade, according to Article 16.8 of the EU Regulation 2019/943 on the internal market for electricity.Historically, electricity cross-border exchanges in the EU were discriminated vis-à-vis exchanges within countries, to the detriment of end consumers. ACER has been working for several years in promoting an increase in cross-border electricity interconnection capacity. This will imply more security of supply and better prices for citizens.In a previous ACER Recommendation, issued in 2016, the Agency proposed three high-level principles, which Transmission System Operators (TSOs) have to take into account when developing capacity calculation and redispatching cost-sharing methodologies to avoid any undue discrimination of cross-zonal exchanges and to ensure that TSOs have incentives to take the right decisions when dealing with network congestion. The Clean Energy Package proposals presented by the European Commission in November 2016 reflected these principles.The recast of the EU Regulation on the internal market for electricity includes a more specific provision on capacity calculation, prescribing that, as from 1 January 2020, TSOs shall make available a minimum binding level of capacity equal to 70% for cross-zonal trade.  The Recommendation published today promotes a consistent implementation of this provision, providing  guidance to TSOs on how to implement the minimum 70% capacity target and to regulatory authorities on how to monitor the achievement of this target in a harmonised and consistent way. The Recommendation will also help Member States to assess how far they are from the target and whether they need to introduce transitory measures.The Recommendation can be accessed here.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Electricity-ACER-issues-a-Recommendation-for-implementing-the-70-minimum-margin-of-capacity-available-for-cross-border-trad.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0041	2019-08-08	ACER decides on the gas capacity booking platform for German-Polish border	 The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) has recently published its Decision for the selection of the gas booking platform to be used at the 'Mallnow' interconnection point and the 'GCP' virtual interconnection point between Germany and Poland. The Decision establishes that the Regional Booking Platform ('RBP'), operated by FGSZ Ltd (Földgázszállító Zrt.) will offer the platform services on the German-Polish border. RBP will offer the services until the concerned transmission system operators come to an agreement on the permanent use of a booking platform and for a maximum of three years.During the decision-making process, the Agency consulted stakeholders in an open consultation process, as well as the concerned transmission system operators and the three booking platforms that are active on the European gas market.​The Agency received offers from the three operational gas booking platforms in response to its Open Call. The offers were evaluated on their eligibility against the legal obligations of Union law and the main obligations deriving from the German national law, as well as a list of IT requirements based on ISO/IEC standards assessed by a certified auditor. The offers were furthermore evaluated based on an IT case study, checking the platform's ability to implement and develop IT projects for offering booking platform services, as well as the financial offer of the platforms. The Agency assessed all these elements and found that RBP submitted overall the most advantageous offer. The Annex to the Decision, containing the evaluation of the offers, will be released in due course following the necessary confidentiality assessment.​You can find the Decision here.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-decides-on-the-gas-capacity-booking-platform-for-German-Polish-border-.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0043	2019-07-29	ACER decides on the methodology for coordinated redispatching and countertrading in Bulgaria, Greece and Romania	 The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) published today a Decision setting the common methodology for coordinated redispatching and countertrading in Bulgaria, Greece and Romania (the South East Europe region). The adopted methodology establishes a coordinated use of redispatching and countertrading resources among the three Transmission System Operators (TSOs): ESO EAD (Bulgaria), ADMIE (Greece) and Transelectrica (Romania). The implementation of the methodology will be achieved by 1st July 2021. Once implemented, it is expected to increase the ability for relevant TSOs and Member States to efficiently use redispatching and countertrading in order to alleviate congestion and avoid unnecessary curtailments of cross-border capacities. The new methodology will also significantly increase the transparency and understanding of how TSOs optimise the use of available redispatching and countertrading resources.Access the Decision here.Access the  adopted methodology for coordinated redispatching and countertrading here​.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-decides-on-the-methodology-for-coordinated-redispatching-and-countertrading-in-Bulgaria,-Greece-and-Romania-.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0044	2019-07-23	ACER consults on the future of gas regulation in the EU	 ​The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) launches today a public consultation on possible actions and legislative proposals for the European energy sector – and, in particular, the gas sector – beyond 2025. The consultation explores policy issues linked to market design and targeted regulatory measures.  The energy transition and decarbonisation policies that lead to a substitution of natural gas with other energy vectors may have consequences for consumers who currently use natural gas to meet their energy needs, and these need to be addressed. It is important to ensure that the transition is based on sound economic principles and leads to the selection of the best-value technologies for decarbonisation. The consultation document takes into account the reflections presented in the Consultation Paper on Regulatory Challenges for a Sustainable Gas Sector produced by the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) in March this year and the responses to it provided by stakeholders.The consultation document focuses on two strategic areas for regulatory action.  They include issues relating to electricity and gas sector coupling, going beyond the regulatory alignment of the gas and electricity sectors:Targeted regulation and market functioning: in the near term, while the European Gas Target Model ​is generally working well, there are some markets where competition is still not effective and consumers' interests are threatened, or where the current system of gas regulation may need review.  Enabling new products and enhancing infrastructure governance: a sustainable future needs decarbonised gases and new technologies (such as power to gas), but the current regulatory framework was not designed with these activities in mind and the lack of regulation for these areas may have unintended consequences, acting as a barrier or hindrance to their development. In this sustainable future, the old roles and responsibilities may no longer be appropriate. The existing unbundling rules may need to be applied to new circumstances.  And, in particular, what was a natural monopoly may now be competing with other services.The consultation document has been developed in cooperation with the European energy regulators.

ACER_NEWS_0046	2019-07-10	ACER publishes annual report on the progress of infrastructure Projects of Common Interest	 ​ACER published recently its fifth consolidated annual report on the progress of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) for trans-European Energy Infrastructure in electricity and gas. The report examines how the projects on the third EU list of PCIs (adopted in November 2017) evolved between January 2018 and January 2019. The Agency notes that 23 electricity and 9 gas PCIs advanced their status during the monitored period. The largest share of PCIs (more than 40%) are in the permitting phase, while about 25% of the electricity and 15% of the gas PCIs are under construction or already commissioned. Despite the overall progress, the commissioning dates for almost half of the PCIs have been delayed or postponed on average by 1.5 years compared to the dates foreseen in previously reported schedules, adding up to the accumulated delays that are repeatedly noted in the Agency's annual PCI monitoring reports. The investment costs for the electricity PCIs amount to €49.5 billion, while for the gas PCIs they amount to €42.9 billion. These figures represent an increase of less than 2% for electricity PCIs and a decrease of 1.4% for gas PCIs compared to the expected overall budget of the same projects in 2018. The interest of the promoters to use the array of available regulatory tools in the EU Regulation for trans-European energy infrastructure remained relatively low. The submission of investment requests and the resulting issuing of cross-border cost allocation (CBCA) decisions are the tools most frequently used by the promoters. The actual and planned filing of applications for project specific risk-related incentives occur only in exceptional cases. The report is available here.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-annual-report-on-the-progress-of-infrastructure-Projects-of-Common-Interest.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0048	2019-07-02	ACER: progress in ENTSOG’s gas network development plan; further improvements needed	 ACER has recently published its Opinion on the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG)’s draft Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP) for 2018. The Agency welcomes the various improvements included in this Plan in comparison to previous editions, and finds that it contributes to the principles of non-discrimination, effective competition, and secure functioning of the gas market.However, the Agency notes that the Plan may not sufficiently contribute to the efficient functioning of the system. In particular, the TYNDP shortcomings are related to the quality and the implementation of the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) methodology, the insufficient analysis of the existing and forecasted use of gas infrastructure, and the inclusion in the plan of a broad portfolio of projects which clearly exceeds the reasonable needs.The Agency encourages ENTSOG to carefully consider the Opinion and implement the Agency’s “short-term” recommendations when finalising the TYNDP 2018. The Agency expects ENTSOG to start working on implementing the Agency’s “long-term” recommendations, for full application in the next TYNDP 2020.Access a summary of recommendations and background here.​Access the Opinion here.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-progress-in-ENTSOG%E2%80%99s-gas-network-development-plan;-further-improvements-needed.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0049	2019-06-21	ACER adopts a decision relevant for outage coordination in electricity	 ​​ACER publishes today a decision – based on the EU Regulation on System Operation in electricity - on the methodology for assessing the relevance of assets for outage coordination. This methodology  sets out harmonised rules for all synchronous areas  and describes in particular the influence computation method. The methodology was originally developed by all TSOs and submitted for approval to National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) before being referred to the Agency. The Agency introduced minor amendments to the all TSOs' proposal in order to improve its legal clarity.  Link to the DecisionLink to the adopted method on assessing the relevance of assets for outage coordination​ BackgroundIn December 2018, the Agency became competent to decide on the methodology for assessing the relevance of assets for outage coordination. In January and February 2019, the Agency consulted all interested stakeholders on this issue (find out more here). All NRAs unanimously decided that the Agency should adopt a decision on the all TSOs' proposal for assessing the relevance of assets for outage coordination. The Agency amended the methodology in few instances where the methodology was unclear and with regard to the implementation planning. The most notable amendment to the methodology is related to the cycle for the re-assessment of assets for outage coordination, which was reduced to 3 years.For more information, please see the Decision. ​ 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-adopts-a-decision-relevant-for-outage-coordination-in-electricity.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0050	2019-06-21	ACER adopts decision on coordinated security analysis in electricity	 ​​​ACER publishes today a decision on the methodology for coordinating operational security analysis for all Transmission System Operators (TSOs). The decision, based on the EU Regulation on System Operation in electricity, will serve as a pan-European frame for the regional proposals on operational security coordination for each capacity calculation region (CCR).Among other things, the decision covers harmonised rules to identify the elements of TSO's observability area and coordination of remedial actions inside a CCR and between CCRs. The methodology was originally developed by all TSOs and submitted for approval to National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), before being referred to the Agency. The Agency introduced some amendments to the proposal in order to improve its legal clarity, but also to impose more concrete and legally enforceable requirements on TSOs and Regional Security Coordinators (RSCs) with regard to their obligations to design and coordinate remedial actions.The Decision also includes a requirement for TSOs to develop a probabilistic approach for risk assessment - to handle the reliability and costs of operation of a power system- and further defines the rules to deal with overlapping zones between CCRs as an amendment to the methodology.  Link to the DecisionLink to the adopted Coordinated Security A​nalysis Methodology BackgroundIn December 2018, the Agency became competent to deci​de on the methodology for coordinated operational security analysis. In January and February 2019, the Agency consulted all interested stakeholders on this issue (find out more here). All NRAs unanimously decided that the Agency should adopt a decision on the all TSOs' proposal for the methodology for coordinating operational security analysis. The Agency amended the methodology in several instances where the methodology was not in line with the EU Regulation on System Operation in electricity, where it insufficiently described the requirements and functionalities of the regional coordination or where it was not clear or lacking with regard to reporting, the implementation time frame and managing future amendments. The most notable amendments to the methodology are related to: The deletion of the distinction between cross-border impacting vs cross-border relevant remedial actions;The inclusion of rules for the design of remedial actions and the identification of cross-border relevant network elements and remedial actions;The inclusion of high-level principles on cross-regional coordination and cost sharing;The requirement for TSOs to develop a probabilistic approach for risk assessment as an amendment to the methodology by 2027.For more information, please see the Decision​. ​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-adopts-decision-on-coordinated-security-analysis-in-electricity.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0052	2019-05-28	ACER reports on contractual gas congestion at interconnection points 28/05/2019	 The Agency publishes today the sixth edition of the Annual Report on Contractual Congestion at Interconnection Points. Contractual congestion occurs when the demand for firm entry or exit capacity services exceeds the offered capacity. In 2018, congestion has been detected at less than 12% of the entry and exit sides of the Interconnection Points ('IPs') within the EU Gas Transmission Network. This report includes the list of contractually congested IPs where the Firm Day Ahead Use-It-or-Lose-It ('FDA UIOLI') mechanism has to be implemented and applied to address congestion at the relevant IPs according to the European Commission's rules on congestion management procedures (CMP). It also reveals to what extent the other CMP have been applied in the European Union and the amount of additional capacity yielded through their use. The findings of this report are based on the analysis of data from ENTSOG's Transparency Platform (TP) for 2018 – 2020, and data from the three capacity booking platforms (GSA, PRISMA, and RBP), using the auction reports for the calendar year 2018. 6th Congestion ReportTechnical Annex to the 6th Congestion Report​How much congestion? Contractual congestion was identified at 31 IP sides, out of which 6 had already been found congested in 2017 and 2 IP sides have been continuously congested from 2015 onwards. For 15 IP sides, contractual congestion was triggered by the non-offer of firm products with the duration of at least one month, whereas the emergence of auction premia and unsuccessful requests indicated contractual congestion for 16 IP sides.  Has any progress been registered? Compared to last year's Congestion Report, where 17 out of 262 IP sides were detected as contractually congested, this year, 31 out of 262 IP sides were congested. Secondary capacity trades were concluded only for five congested IP sides in 2017, compared to seven in 2016. What comes next? The Firm Day-Ahead Use-It-Or-Lose-It (FDA UIOLI) mechanism is already applied at 10 of the 31 IP sides detected as contractually congested. This means that at the remaining 25 contractually congested IP sides, the respective National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) shall require the relevant TSO(s) to implement and apply the FDA UIOLI mechanism or prove that the congested situation is unlikely to reoccur in the following three years. ACER's main recommendation to NRAs, ENTSOG and TSOs Improve data reliability: CMP data availability needs to be further improved by ENTSOG/TSOs, by ensuring that auction results with premia and data on all non-available capacity products are uploaded on the ENTSOG's TP, as required by the CMP Guidelines. The list of CAM relevant IP sides needs to be validated to ensure a correct list of IP sides that have to be evaluated in the congestion report.ACER's recommendations to the European Commission Revise the CMP Guidelines to enhance the effectiveness of the measures. Review the criterion d) of paragraph 2.2.3(1) of the CMP Guidelines to align it with the other congestion criteria.Establish a date after which the Agency no longer has to produce a congestion report. ​​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-reports-on-contractual-gas-congestion-at-interconnection-points-28-05-2019.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0053	2019-05-27	Improved consistency of national Network Development Plans with ENTSO-E European plan	 The Agency publishes today its Opinion on the National electricity Network Development Plans (NDPs) and their consistency with the European Union-wide electricity Ten-year Network Development Plan (EU TYNDP) prepared by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E). The Agency concludes that the consistency of the NDPs with the EU TYNDP improved compared to the past. ACER identified the following improvements:·         A more widespread use of biennial rather than yearly plans.·         A more widespread use of cost-benefit analyses for projects and more benefit categories in the NDP.·         A more widespread inclusion of third-party projects in the NDPs, as well as a more systematic use of a multi-scenario approach. However, the Agency also notes that some of the practices used for the overall development, review and adoption of the NDPs might negatively impact the robustness, credibility and transparency of the NDPs or could result in inconsistencies with the EU TYNDP. Therefore, the Agency identified in this Opinion several areas for improvement, both regarding the EU TYNDP and the NDPs.​Find out more here. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Improved-consistency-of-national-Network-Development-Plans-with-ENTSO-E-European-plan-.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0059	2019-04-11	ACER adopts Decision on gas interconnection between Hungary and Austria	" ACER publishes today its Decision on the incremental capacity project proposal for the Mosonmagyaróvár gas interconnection point - the “HUAT project""- between Hungary and Austria, which was adopted on 9 April after receiving the favourable opinion of the ACER Board of Regulators.Following the completion of the steps foreseen in the EU Regulation establishing a network code on capacity allocation mechanisms in gas transmission systems, the Transmission System Operators in Austria and Hungary - Gas Connect Austria GmbH (GCA) and Földgázszállitó Zártkörüen Müködö Részvénytársaság Zrt (FGSZ) - submitted separately their proposals for the HUAT project for approval to their corresponding National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) Magyar Energetikai és Közmüszabályozási Hivatal (MEKH) and E-Control (ECA). On 27 April 2018, ECA issued a decision approving the HUAT project proposal, and on 5 October 2018 MEKH issued a decision rejecting the HUAT project proposal. Since a coordinated decision was not reached within 6 months of receipt of the HUAT project proposal by the last receiving NRA (ECA, 9 April 2018), the Agency became responsible for issuing a decision on the HUAT project proposal.The Agency was not called to decide on the technical or economic merits of the HUAT project, nor on whether an investment in the HUAT project is to be made, but to define the parameters of the economic test of the HUAT project, so that it can be tested on the market.  The Agency has defined the parameters of the economic test to keep the TSOs' risk and financial position similar to their current state, to ensure, for example, that there are no further risks or potential detrimental effects, including those of stranded assets, and that captive customers are not exposed to undue risks of the investment.The Agency notes that, as required by the network code on capacity allocation mechanisms in gas transmission systems, the HUAT project shall be initiated only if the economic test has a positive outcome on both sides of the Mosonmagyarövár interconnection point for at least one of the two offer levels proposed by the project promoters. With its Decision, the Agency aims to ensure that the HUAT project is tested on the market and possibly implemented on the basis of rules and conditions that are consistent with those of other incremental capacity projects of GCA and FGSZ, regardless of whether those projects are competing or complementary.The Agency's Decision is available here​."	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-adopts-Decision-on-gas-interconnection-between-Hungary-and-Austria-.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0060	2019-04-05	ACER adopts decision on amendment to determination of capacity calculation regions	 ​The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) has adopted a Decision on the proposal of all EU Transmission System Operators (TSOs) for the amendment to the determination of capacity calculation regions.The proposal was initially submitted to all energy regulatory authorities, which could not reach an agreement. They subsequently referred the proposal to the Agency for a decision. The Agency's decision temporally assigns a new bidding zone border between the bidding zones of Denmark 1 and of the Netherlands to the Hansa capacity calculation region, but requires from TSOs to further analyse the optimal determination of the Hansa and Channel regions. The Agency also amended the determination of the Greece-Italy (GRIT) capacity calculation region in order to align it with the changes in the bidding zone borders resulting from the bidding zone review recently performed in Italy.

ACER_NEWS_0061	2019-04-05	ACER reports on gas conditional capacity products in the EU	 The Agency publishes today its Report on the conditionalities stipulated in contracts for standard capacity products for firm capacity and an underlying consultancy Study as required by the EU Regulation establishing a Network Code on Capacity Allocation Mechanisms in gas transmission systems. In order to ensure that gas can be traded independently of its location in the system, network users must be given the freedom to book entry and exit capacity independently from each other. ACER's Report analyses the current restrictions in capacity products that prevent this from happening.  What are conditional contracts?The entry-exit system is a market access model that allows network users to book capacity rights independently at any entry and any exit point of the system. The entry-exit model promotes trading of entry-paid gas at hubs and leads to a dynamic way to transport gas through zones, with easy access to multiple end-users. Current EU legislation recognises firm and interruptible capacity products. It does not mention, nor does it forbid, conditional capacities. Conditionalities exist when a network user is not allowed to book entry and exit capacities independently from one another, or faces restrictions on freely flowing gas from any entry to any exit point of a market area or zone. It also exists when network users can choose not to use the free and fully allocable firm capacity and commit to a more restrictive contract. In such cases, network users are incentivised to limit their capacity rights by discounts. Which countries are concerned? The use of conditional products and legacy contracts with contractual limitations occur in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Great Britain. The underlying Study provides a full review of these situations. What are ACER's recommendations?The main recommendations of the Agency to the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and the transmission system operators (TSOs):create a EU-catalogue of conditional products with product and pricing descriptions;harmonise the discounts concerning conditional products; study the cross-border effects of conditional products and their tariffs in order to limit cross-subsidies between transit and domestic users;provide higher transparency about the traded volumes and capacity tariffs of conditional products on the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG) Transparency Platform;perform a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) for zone mergers potentially creating or increasing the use of conditional products;terminate transit contracts that do not follow the entry-exit model.The Agency supports clarifying in the EU legislation the definition of the entry-exit model and the legal requirements of this model. The Agency, in general, recommends that the national regulatory authorities assess on a case-by-case basis whether conditional capacity products are favourable compared to alternative measures to deal with network restrictions, such as an upgrade of the gas network, by using cross-border CBAs.

ACER_NEWS_0063	2019-03-22	ACER publishes guidance on layering and spoofing in continuous wholesale energy markets	 ACER publishes today a guidance note to further clarify the application of REMIT (EU Regulation on Wholesale Market Integrity and Transparency) in the context of the trading behaviours associated with layering and spoofing. With this publication, ACER aims at sharing its insights on the general framework of assessment that National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) shall use to determine whether a specific behaviour could constitute a breach of REMIT. Layering and spoofing refers to the issuing by a market participant of one large or multiple non-genuine orders to trade on one side of the order book, in order to enter into one or multiple transactions on the other side of the order book.On gas and electricity exchanges and other electronic trading venues, the order book for continuous trading displays the unveiled interest of buyers and sellers in an anonymised manner. In this setting, by issuing one or multiple non-genuine orders, a single market participant can alter the order book that is visible to other players. By design, layering and spoofing behaviours create, through non-genuine orders, the likelihood of sending false or misleading signals regarding the supply, demand or price of a wholesale energy product. They are also likely to secure the price formation process of the wholesale energy product at an artificial level. The perception of layering and spoofing undermines confidence in market signals. If market participants perceive that the order book does not reflect market fundamentals, they may lose confidence in the integrity and transparency of the market, and even withdraw from it. As a result, competition would be adversely affected, to the detriment of all Market Participants and the final consumers of energy.Recent NRA Decisions on market abuse have highlighted the importance of detecting order-based manipulation. ACER has been investing in capabilities for the detection of potentially abusive behaviours based on the issuance of non-genuine orders in the wholesale energy markets. Anomalous instances detected by ACER are shared with the relevant NRA that takes the necessary investigatory and enforcement measures.This is the third guidance note published by ACER in the area of market abuse. The previous guidance notes covered the behaviours of transmission capacity hoarding and wash trades.The guidance note on layering and spoofing is available here.The updated ACER Guidance (4th edition) on the application of REMIT can be found here​.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-guidance-on-layering-and-spoofing-in-continuous-wholesale-energy-markets-.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0070	2019-01-30	First ACER Report on the implementation of the CACM Regulation and the FCA Regulation available online	 ​First ACER Report on the implementation of the CACM Regulation and the FCA Regulation available onlineThe Agency publishes today its first monitoring report ​on the implementation of the Guideline on Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management (CACM Regulation) and the Guideline on Forward Capacity Allocation (FCA Regulation). The CACM Regulation lays down the binding guidelines for the implementation and operation of EU-wide single market coupling in the day ahead and intraday timeframe. The FCA Regulation lays down detailed rules on cross-zonal capacity calculation and allocation in the forward timeframe. Both regulations aim at facilitating electricity trading across the European Union.The report describes the status of the implementation and application of both regulations across the EU Member States. The CACM Regulation is applicable since 14 August 2015, whereas the FCA Regulation is applicable since 17 October 2016. In its first report, beyond the assessment of compliance, the Agency identifies difficulties faced in implementing these regulations. The Agency provided conclusions and recommendations across the EU.Main findings:The implementation of the Code can overall be considered successful and a decisive milestone in the development of fully integrated electricity markets across the EU. The single day ahead coupling is almost complete, mainly as a result of early and voluntary initiatives. This still needs to be transformed into the single day-ahead coupling as formally established by the CACM Regulation and the corresponding terms and conditions or methodologies. Many new detailed terms and conditions or methodologies have been adopted either at EU or regional level while most of them still need to be implemented. This process, though legally and organisationally complex, can be considered a successful approach to develop ​and define all the necessary design elements for an integrated electricity market.Despite this progress, there are still a number of challenges, which will require utmost attention and improvement in the forthcoming years.For the FCA Regulation, the main points of attention include (i) rules related to the harmonisation of the Long Term Transmission Rights, where currently some annexes to the harmonised allocation rules include regional specificities, which in a few instances significantly deviate from the harmonised allocation rules or even from the FCA Regulation itself, and (ii) the regulatory authorities' decisions on cross-zonal risk hedging opportunities, where the Agency recommends the development of harmonised criteria and metrics based on which the need for hedging instruments issued by TSOs could be objectively identified. For the CACM Regulation, the main points of attention include (i) The methodologies related to capacity calculation and to redispatching and countertrading, where the Agency notes that the problem of undue discrimination between internal and cross-zonal exchanges is not properly addressed by the current TSOs' proposals; (ii) The bidding zone configuration as the first bidding zone review failed to deliver its objectives according to the CACM Regulation and the Agency recommends improvements in terms of governance and methodology before this exercise is repeated; (iii) the Market Coupling Operator ('MCO') Function, for which the legal framework is complex and suboptimal and the Agency recommends a revision of the governance of the algorithms and of the associated cost recovery; and (iv) the design of the intraday coupling, not well defined in the CACM Regulation, leading to a risk that the single intraday market be fragmented in terms of timeframes, design and geography.​Beyond the technical issues, the Agency lists possible improvements regarding the Network Code implementation process, such as the avoidance of unnecessary delays in the adoption and implementation of some terms and conditions or methodologies or the improvement of transparency over the process of adoption of these methodologies. Useful   Links:CACM and FCA implementation monitoring reportForward Capacity AllocationCapacity Allocation And Congestion Management​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/First-ACER-Report-on-the-implementation-of-the-CACM-Regulation-and-the-FCA-Regulation-available-online.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0073	2019-01-25	ACER decision on the methodology for pricing cross-border capacity in the intraday electricity market	 ​The Agency published today a decision setting the framework for the pricing of capacity among bidding zones in the intraday electricity market. The intraday market is becoming increasingly important as more renewable power enters the grid.The methodology establishes the framework for the pricing of intraday cross-zonal capacity. The chosen model introduces three pan-European implicit auctions to price cross-zonal capacity, which will complement the already functioning single intraday coupling based on continuous trading. The implementation timeline, and where relevant, the conditions for the implementation of these three intraday auctions, will be developed in the framework of the amendment of the algorithm methodology. Link to the decisionLink to the adopted methodology for pricing cross-border capacity in the intraday electricity market (ANNEX I)  Background In July 2018, the Agency became competent to decide on the proposal from all Electricity Transmission System Operators on the methodology for pricing intraday cross-zonal capacity. The Agency's decision amends the methodology in several instances in which the methodology was not in line with the CACM Regulation or described insufficiently the requirements or functionalities. The main amendment relates to the number of pan-European intraday auctions, which will increase from one to three. The implementation timeline, and where relevant, the conditions for the implementation of these three intraday auctions, will have to be developed in the framework of the amendment of the algorithm methodology.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-decision-on-the-methodology-for-pricing-cross-border-capacity-in-the-intraday-electricity-market.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0074	2019-01-21	ACER finds different status across borders for several electricity interconnection investments	 ​The Agency has published today its Opinion on the implementation of the electricity investments in the European Union-wide electricity Ten-year Network Development Plan (EU TYNDP). The Agency found that 21% of the national investments encountered delays, most frequently due to permit granting reasons, and 26% have been rescheduled by the promoter over the past two years. Moreover, the Agency found that around 25% of the interconnections were subject to a different investment status across the border. While this is not per se proof of an inconsistency in the implementation, it could point to limited cross-border coordination among the parties. Therefore, the Agency recommends to the promoters, Transmission System Operators and National Regulatory Authorities to review jointly the concerned interconnection investments and amend the respective implementation plans in case of inconsistency.Access the opinion here.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-finds-different-status-across-borders-for-several-electricity-interconnection-investments.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0081	2018-10-31	ACER reports on the Inter-Transmission System Operator Compensation mechanism in 2017	 ​The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) released today its “Report on the implementation of the Inter-Transmission System Operator Co​​mpensation (ITC) mechanism in 2017”. According to EU legislation, ACER annually reviews the implementation of this mechanism and the management of the ITC Fund established by ENTSO-E for the purpose of compensating TSOs for the costs incurred on national transmission systems due to hosting cross-border flows of electricity.The Agency notes that the ITC Fund remained relatively stable compared to 2016, amounting to €259.35 million. While the volume of losses due to transits significantly increased (by 20%), its rising impact on the losses component of the ITC Fund was almost fully compensated by a remarkable reduction (by 16.7%) of the weighted average value of losses for the ITC Parties. In 2017 this value was 35.36 €/MWh, which is the lowest figure registered since 2011.​The full report is available here​. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-reports-on-the-Inter-Transmission-System-Operator-Compensation-mechanism-in-2017.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0086	2018-10-22	Lower wholesale energy prices translate into lower retail prices for the second year in a row	 ​Average energy retail prices for households in the EU decreased in 2017, reflecting for the second consecutive year the decline of energy wholesale prices in preceding years, also thanks to market integration. However, the non-contestable part of the bill (network costs, taxes, levies and other charges) continued to increase. Some of the non-contestable components of the bill have supported the development of renewable energies, which are key for the EU to fulfil the objectives of the Paris agreement against climate change.The Annual Report on the Results of Monitoring the Internal Electricity and Natural Gas Markets​ was presented today in Brussels by the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER). For some retail and the gas wholesale market metrics, the Contracting Parties2 of the Energy Community are also included in the analysis.In electricity, the full integration of day-ahead and intraday markets is getting closer, as illustrated, for example, by the high level of efficiency in the use of cross border capacity for day ahead trading - up to 86% in 2017. However, due to the limited capacity available for trading, cross-border exchanges continued to be discriminated against compared to exchanges within countries, to the detriment of end-consumers. In this respect, Alberto Pototschnig, ACER Director, advocated for an “enhanced amount of cross-border commercial capacity to be made available for trading, to bring more security of supply and better prices to citizens”. Gas wholesale markets continue their positive performance in terms of both market functioning and price convergence. However, an EU-wide Internal Gas Market is not a reality yet, as the gap between better functioning markets and those without transparent trading venues continues to widen. Gas network codes are contributing to market functioning in those EU Member States in which gas wholesale markets function well or are improving.CEER President, Garrett Blaney, stated: “The Market Monitoring Report confirms the value of regulators monitoring markets and the enforcement of consumer rights. Whilst it is good to have a Supplier of Last Resort (SOLR) or default supplier, the SOLR mechanism should not lead to consumers remaining inactive on a permanent basis or be used to keep regulated prices in place.”For the Energy Community Contracting Parties, Janez Kopač, Director of the Energy Community Secretariat, highlighted: “On average, we continue to witness positive effects of market liberalisation on both electricity and gas retail markets. However, the majority of the national gas wholesale markets, with the exception of Ukraine, are still import dependent and illiquid. This calls for the continued alignment with the EU acquis and increased efforts to implement the Energy Community law as a precondition for market integration and cross-border trade. “I am pleased that our cooperation with ACER and CEER has deepened – thanks also to the efforts that Contracting Party national energy regulators devote to data provision and analysis”, he added.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Lower-wholesale-energy-prices-translate-into-lower-retail-prices-for-the-second-year-in-a-row.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0087	2018-10-16	ACER decides the capacity booking platform for gas to be used on the border between Germany and Poland	 ​The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) published today a Decision establishing GSA as the booking platform to be used at Mallnow interconnection point (IP) and the 'GCP' virtual interconnection point (VIP) on both sides of the German-Polish border. The Agency became competent to make the decision after the German and Polish transmission system operators (TSOs) and the relevant national regulatory authorities (NRAs) failed to reach an agreement within the legal deadlines foreseen by the network code on capacity allocation mechanisms. The Decision is valid for the following three years unless the concerned TSOs agree on a permanent booking platform before. The Agency encourages TSOs on the German-Polish border to reach a permanent agreement.Access the Decision here. BackgroundThe network code on capacity allocation mechanisms (EU Regulation) requires TSOs to reach a contractual agreement to use a single booking platform to offer capacity on an IP or VIP. The Agency became competent to decide on the matter on 19 April 2018. During the decision-making process, the Agency consulted with the concerned national regulatory authorities, transmission system operators and stakeholders. The Agency requested offers from the three booking platforms active on the European gas market for their capacity booking services. The offers were evaluated against a list of criteria, containing requirements related to legal obligations that the booking platforms in any event need to comply with, and award criteria. The award criteria consisted of a financial aspect, on the one hand, and qualitative criteria, on the other. The Agency assessed all these elements to determine which booking platform submitted the most advantageous offer overall.The Agency's consultation with stakeholders and evaluation of responses can be found here.The Agency's letters requesting offers from the booking platforms can be found here. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-decides-the-capacity-booking-platform-for-gas-to-be-used-on-the-border-between-Germany-and-Poland.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0088	2018-10-16	ACER reports on specific incentives for higher risk trans-European energy infrastructure projects	" ​The Agency publishes today its “Summary Report on practices in the application of project-specific risk-based incentives"" on the basis of the EU Regulation on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure. This regulatory tool aims to ensure that appropriate incentives are granted to those projects of common interest (PCI) which incur higher risks compared to the risks normally incurred by a comparable project.The Agency observes that six requests have been made by PCI promoters for this type of incentives - two in electricity, four in gas - since 2013. One electricity request in the Netherlands and three gas requests - one in Slovakia and two in Lithuania - led to the granting of project-specific risk-based incentives such as higher allowance for operational expenditures, minimum guaranteed revenue, ex-ante cost inclusion, among others.The Agency underlines that the project-specific risk-based incentive schemes have to be read in conjunction with the risk and reward balance that is offered to project promoters through the respective general national regulatory frameworks.The Report is available here. "	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-reports-on-specific-incentives-for-higher-risk-trans-European-energy-infrastructure-projects.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0090	2018-10-08	ACER decision on fallback procedures for the Core Capacity Calculation Region	 ACER decision on fallback procedures for the Core Capacity Calculation Region In a Decision recently published, ACER revised the methodology proposed by Transmission System Operators of Austria, Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia - which will apply a coordinated calculation and allocation of the capacity between bidding zones (the Core Capacity Calculation Region) - for establishing the rules for alternative capacity allocation - fallback procedures - in the event that the single day-ahead coupling process is unable to produce results. For alternative capacity allocation a shadow auction is proposed, such that when single day-ahead coupling fails, the cross-zonal capacity is auctioned as a standalone product, in contrast to single day-ahead coupling where it is auctioned combined with energy.The methodology was originally developed by the TSOs of the above-mentioned countries and submitted for approval to their respective National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs). As NRAs could not reach an agreement, the case was referred to the Agency, which introduced several amendments to the proposal and harmonised the shadow allocation rules. Acces the decision here.Access the Core CCR fallback procedures here.  Background  In March 2018, the Agency became competent to decide on the amended proposal from the Core Capacity Calculation Region (CCR) TSOs on the Core CCR fallback procedures. The decision was referred to the Agency since one regulatory authority could not approve the proposal from the Core TSOs on the grounds that it contains shadow allocation rules. In August 2018, the Agency consulted all interested stakeholders on this issue (see the details here​). The Core TSO proposal contained the main document with fallback procedures and five annexes containing the shadow allocation rules for different bidding zone borders and different timeframes. The Agency’s decision introduced minimum changes to fallback procedures aimed at improving legal clarity and enforceability. Instead of five different shadow allocation rules, the Agency adopted one single set of shadow allocation rules and explained to which bidding zone borders they are applicable. These shadow allocation rules will be applied by the single allocation platform.   The most notable amendments to the methodology are related to:the improvements of the definitions and terms used;the adoption of single set of shadow allocation rules instead of five different ones;the provision of transitional arrangements for the bidding zone borders of the Four Markets Market Coupling region (Czech Republic - Slovakia, Slovakia - Hungary, Hungary - Romania);the alignment of the annexed shadow allocation rules with the harmonised allocation rules established pursuant to the FCA Regulation;the removal of all references to specific CCR from shadow allocation rules, aiming to enable the use of the same shadow allocation rules in other CCRs, whereas region specific requirements would not be contained in the shadow allocation rules, but rather published by the allocation platform.​For more information, please see the De​cision here​.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-decision-on-fallback-procedures-for-the-Core-Capacity-Calculation-Region.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0092	2018-08-06	ACER finds delays and varying performance in the implementation of the Gas Balancing Network Code	 The Agency publishes today its third Report on the implementation of the Balancing Network Code. Rules on gas balancing aim to facilitate gas trading across EU balancing zones and to contribute to the development of short-term markets. In an appropriate trading environment, network users are able to manage their risks and opportunities related to gas imbalances. The Agency invites interested parties to use the Agency’s Balancing Analytical Framework to carry out their own analysis and to offer feedback to the Agency in order to improve the Framework.Main findings:Implementation delays: some Member States need to take the necessary steps to meet the April 2019 deadline for full implementation.Transmission System Operators:  TSOs play an important role in the development of short-term markets. TSOs’ balancing activity needs to stimulate the short-term market, building on the use of short-term standardised products wherever possible.Performance: the discrepancies in the indicators across regimes hint at differences in performance of the various balancing regimes. The indicators can be used to detect areas for regime improvement.Data: The Agency looks forward to getting complete and validated data for all the indicators of the Framework, as a precondition for its next analysis.Main recommendations:National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), TSOs and market players are encouraged to follow up on the evolution of the balancing systems design.The evolution of the neutrality cash-flows and gas accounting should be followed up by NRAs and TSOs.Where significant use of other tools beyond short-term standardised products takes place, their need, appropriateness, transparent use deserves constant regulatory scrutiny.Tolerance removals shall take place step-by-step and Balancing Platforms shall be carefully assessed and preferably ended.You can access the Report here.Previous Reports on the implementation of the CodeSecond ACER Report on the implementation of the Balancing Network Code – 16 November 2017 (Volume I​ and Volume II)ACER Report on the implementation of the Balancing Network Code ​– 7 November 2016 (Technical Annexes)Background: The Agency’s third Report analyses the functioning of the balancing systems of seven balancing zones during Gas Year 2016/17.

It covers also the requirements that both algorithms must fulfil. The methodology was originally developed by all NEMOs and submitted for approval to regulatory authorities. The case was later referred to the Agency. The Agency introduced many amendments to the proposal in order to improve its legal clarity, but also to impose more concrete and legally enforceable requirements on NEMOs with regard to their obligations to develop the algorithms and with regard to the underlying rules for monitoring and changing the algorithms.DecisionAdopted Algorithm methodologyBackgroundIn January 2018, the Agency became competent to decide on the amended proposal from all NEMOs on the price coupling algorithm and the continuous trading matching algorithm. In May 2018, the Agency consulted all interested stakeholders on this issue (see the details here​).All NEMOs submitted an amended proposal for the price coupling algorithm and the continuous trading matching algorithm methodology to all regulatory authorities, but they were not satisfied with the overall quality of the proposal and some proposed concepts and for this reason they referred it to the Agency for a decision. The Agency amended the methodology in several instances where the methodology was not in line with the CACM Regulation, where it insufficiently described the requirements and functionalities of the algorithms or where it was not clear or sufficient with regard to monitoring, transparency and managing changes to the algorithms.The most notable amendments to the methodology are related to:the improvements of the definitions and terms used;the clarification of the management of the algorithm performance with regard to the products and requirements;the introduction of explicit and shorter deadlines for the development of the algorithms;the clarification of the concepts of maximising economic welfare, scalability and repeatability of the algorithms;the transparency and monitoring of the performance of the algorithms by setting procedures, which require the NEMOs to publish various reports and information and to keep the algorithm performance within the required standards;the change management and decision making processes to better reflect the cooperation of NEMOs with TSOs. For more information, please see the Decision.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-adopts-a-decision-on-the-methodology-to-establish-market-coupling-algorithms.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0096	2018-07-27	The Agency publishes its first analysis on Tariff Code implementation for gas	 ​The Agency published today its first Report on the implementation of the Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff Structures for Gas. The code requires the NRA or TSO to consult stakeholders on the proposed tariff structure and forward the consultation document to the Agency, which has to analyse all these consultation documents for completeness and compliance. This Report presents the analysis of the Agency for the transmission system of the Netherlands.The Report analyses the consultation document published by the Dutch regulator, ACM. The Dutch paper is a good example of a consultation document.

ACER_NEWS_0099	2018-07-11	ACER finds mixed progress in the implementation of infrastructure Projects of Common Interest	 ACER published today its fourth consolidated annual report on the progress of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) for trans-European Energy Infrastructure in electricity and gas. The report examines how the projects on the third EU list of PCIs (adopted in November 2017) evolved, covering the -month period from January 2017 to January 2018.Observed delaysA total of 20 electricity and gas PCIs, out of those which were already on the previous PCI lists, advanced their status during the monitored period. At this time, the largest number of PCIs are in the stage of permitting. However, despite the advancement in status of a considerable number of projects, the commissioning dates for almost half of the PCIs have again been shifted by one or two years into the future compared to the dates foreseen in previously reported schedules, adding up to the accumulated delays that are repeatedly noted in the Agency’s annual PCI monitoring reports.In gas, seven PCIs with unchanged scope registered a setback or “reverse progress”, i.e. they are currently in a less advanced status than before.  The Agency finds that such a “reverse progress” of projects with unchanged scope is difficult to explain.For 16 electricity and 10 gas PCIs, no works or activities were reported to have been carried out during 2017. The Agency strongly encourages Regional Groups thoroughly to examine, in the context of the up-coming PCI selection process, the merits of those PCI candidates for which no evidence of implementation efforts can be observed during the time of their presence in the PCI list.Investments costsThe investment costs, as reported by the promoters, amount to €49.3 billion in 2018 values for electricity PCIs and €43.7 billion for gas PCIs. The cost tag is actually even higher, since the expected life-cycle costs of the projects also have to be considered. The total amount spent by 2017 since the establishment of the first PCI list in October 2013 was €5.8 billion for electricity PCIs and €9.65 billion for gas PCIs, representing only 11.8% of the overall PCIs budget for electricity and 22.1% for gas. This reveals that the pace to meet the indicated implementation schedules is insufficient, since around half of the overall projects’ budget should be incurred in the coming 4-5 years.Given some significant discrepancies of project budgets, the Regional Groups should take action to ensure the incorporation of the PCI monitoring results into the next PCI selection in order to help ensure a more realistic cost estimate of future PCIs.Forecasted benefitsRegarding the forecasted benefits of the electricity projects, the overall cost-benefit ratio for transmission PCIs was found to exceed 1.5. Although this ratio has increased compared to 2017, this is seemingly due to the more optimistic Ten Year National Development Plan (TYNDP) scenarios used for the PCI selection 2017, and not due to an efficiency increase. Also, for 18 transmission PCIs it was found that the considered monetised benefits do not outweigh their total expected costs.The assessment of the benefits of the gas PCIs faced serious difficulties and the Agency lacked comprehensive monetised benefits data for gas projects, as it was only reported for six of those. The Agency recommends ENTSOG to foresee in the CBA methodology ways and means that would allow project promoters to assess the value of the lifecycle costs and the benefits of the PCIs. The Agency recommends project promoters to evaluate the costs and the benefits of their projects from the inception of the project and to track the progress of the costs and benefits over the entire project cycle.The report is available here​.​ 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-finds-mixed-progress-in-the-implementation-of-infrastructure-Projects-of-Common-Interest.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0100	2018-07-05	European Commission aims to enhance ACER’s mandate and the powers of its Director	 ​European Commission Vice-President for the Energy Union, Maroš Šefčovič, highlighted today that the EU aims at ensuring an energy system aligned with the high-pace technological change: “Our ambition is not only to keep up with the existing developments, but to lead the way, and we are relying on the important work of ACER in order to achieve these goals. That is why we insisted on expanding ACER's mandate”, he said during a live connection from Brussels, through which he delivered his keynote speech at the Agency’s Annual Conference 2018. “The Agency’s achievements in only seven years have been impressive” completed Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy, Miguel Arias Cañete in a video message. “It was therefore logical that we wanted to enhance the role of the Agency and increase the competences and powers of the Director as a necessity to achieve better and faster results”, he added.  When presenting the aims of the Conference – “An Energy Union for all Europeans” -, ACER Director Alberto Pototschnig highlighted how the current legal framework, once fully implemented, will support the development of the energy sector for the next 5-10 years and “also provides the foundations for the further thinking likely to be necessary beyond this horizon”. On this basis, participants discussed the “smart” future facing the energy sector, the opportunities for sector coupling for a better utilisation of renewable energies, as well as pricing in the EU energy market. The three thematic sessions were moderated by Dr Romana Jordan, Chair of ACER’s Administrative Board, Mr Andris Piebalgs, Chair of ACER’s Board of Appeal, and Garrett Blaney, Chair of ACER’s Board of Regulators. The Conference opened with a welcome address by the Slovenian Minister of Infrastructure, Peter Gašperšič, and a presentation on the priorities of the Austrian EU Presidency in the field of energy by Andrea Steinmetz, Deputy Head of Department of the Austrian Ministry for Sustainability. The Conference also included a video message by Dominique Ristori, Director General for Energy of the European Commission.​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/European-Commission-aims-to-enhance-ACER%E2%80%99s-mandate-and-the-powers-of-its-Director.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0101	2018-06-28	ACER publishes its Decision on the exemption request for the AQUIND interconnector	 ​ACER publishes today a Decision, adopted on 19 June 2018, on the request for exemptions from some regulatory provisions of the EU Electricity Regulation and the Electricity Directive in the Third Energy Package for the AQUIND Interconnector between France and Great Britain. The Agency has decided not to grant the requested exemptions from the provisions on the use of congestion revenues, on unbundling, on third party access and on terms and conditions for connection and access, including tariffs.In the Agency’s view, the AQUIND Interconnector project does not meet one of the conditions set in Article 17 of the EU Electricity Regulation (EC) No 714/2009, which requires that the level of risk attached to the investment be such that the project would not be realised unless an exemption were granted.In particular, the Agency was not able to identify with the required certainty a level of risk for the AQUIND Interconnector that would lead to the project not to be realised without the requested exemptions. In fact, the Agency considered that the status of EU ‘Project of Common Interest (PCI), recently granted to the AQUIND Interconnector, allows the project promoter to submit to the relevant regulatory authorities an investment request, including a request for cross-border cost allocation, that could result in a decision to recover its efficient incurred costs via regulated tariffs.The possibility for the AQUIND interconnector to follow a regulated route is even more relevant when considering  the Agency’s assessment of the need for capacity on the border between France and Great Britain, which concludes that the three new projects under development on that border –AQUIND Interconnector, FAB Link, and GridLink (with a total capacity of 4.8 GW) – appear to be socially beneficial on top of the capacity provided by the existing ‘IFA interconnector’ and the two projects currently under construction: ‘ElecLink’ and ‘IFA2’.Accordingly, the Agency could not identify a level of risk related to a lack of financial underpinning via the regulatory regime which would meet the condition of Article 17 of the EU Electricity Regulation.In addition, the Agency came to the conclusion that other risks claimed by AQUIND Limited, including, among others, technological, construction, operation, policy, and macroeconomic risks, were not such that this condition for exemptions under the mentioned Regulation would be met. You can find the Decision here.BackgroundAccording to Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009, regulatory authorities may grant, upon request, exemptions from the provisions of Article 16(6) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 and Articles 9, 32 and Article 37(6) and (10) of Directive 2009/72/EC, provided that specific conditions are met. One those conditions requires that the level of risk attached to the investment at issue is such that the investment would not take place unless an exemption is granted (Article 17(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009).According to Article 17(4) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009, the regulatory authorities receiving a request for exemption should reach an agreement and take a decision on that request within six months after the receipt of the request by the last regulatory authority; where the regulatory authorities are not able to reach an agreement within that period or upon their joint request, the Agency becomes responsible for adopting the decision concerning the request for exemption.Following a joint request by CRE and Ofgem, on 19 December 2017, the Agency became responsible to adopt a decision concerning AQUIND Limited’s request for exemptions. Before taking its decision, the Agency carried out consultations with the relevant parties. The Agency also invited any third party to send observations regarding AQUIND Limited’s request for exemptions (see relevant public notice and responses here​).  	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-its-Decision-on-the-exemption-request-for-the-AQUIND-interconnector.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0103	2018-05-31	ACER reports on contractual gas congestion at interconnection points	 The Agency publishes today the fifth edition of the Annual Report on Contractual Congestion at Interconnection Points. Contractual congestion occurs when the demand for firm entry or exit capacity services exceeds the offered capacity. In 2017, congestion has been detected at less than 7% of the entry and exit sides of the Interconnection Points ('IPs') within the EU Gas Transmission Network. This report includes the list of contractually congested IPs where the Firm Day Ahead Use-It-or-Lose-It ('FDA UIOLI') mechanism has to be implemented and applied to address congestion at the relevant IPs. It also reveals to what extent the other Congestion Management Procedures ('CMP') have been applied in the European Union and the amount of additional capacity yielded through their use. The findings of this report are based on the analysis of data from ENTSOG's Transparency Platform (TP) for 2017 – 2019, and data from the three capacity booking platforms (GSA, PRISMA, and RBP), using the auction reports for the calendar year 2017. 5th Congestion ReportTechnical Annex to the 5th Congestion ReportHow much congestion? Contractual congestion was identified at 17 IP sides, out of which 9 had already been found congested in 2016 (in 2015 and 2014 they were 10 and 6 respectively).  For 11 IP sides, contractual congestion was triggered by the non-offer of firm products with the duration of at least one month, whereas the emergence of auction premia and unsuccessful requests indicated contractual congestion for 6 IP sides.Where? 12 out of the 17 contractually congested IP sides are cross-border IPs between Germany and its neighbours and at inland German IP sides. Further 3 IP sides were congested in the South South East Region.  Has any progress been registered? Compared to last year's Congestion Report, where 23 IP sides out of 247 were detected contractually congested, this year, only 17 out of 262 IP sides were congested. At the congested points, one IP side applied Surrender, and no application of Oversubscription & Buy Back has been identified.Secondary capacity trades have been concluded only for five congested IP sides in 2017, compared to seven in 2016. What comes next? For the five congested IP sides where the FDA UIOLI has still not been implemented and the Austrian IP side, where FDA UIOLI was not duly reported, National Regulatory Authorities ('NRAs') shall take the relevant measures, which include: to require TSOs to implement and apply the FDA UIOLI mechanism or prove that the congested situation is unlikely to reoccur in the following three years. to improve TSO data reporting.ACER's main recommendation to NRAs, ENTSOG and TSOs Improve data reliability: CMP data availability needs to be further improved by ENTSOG/TSOs, by ensuring that auction results with premia and data on all non-available capacity products are uploaded on the ENTSOG's TP, as required by the CMP Guidelines. The list of CAM relevant IP sides needs to be validated to ensure a correct list of IP sides that have to be evaluated in the congestion report.ACER's recommendations to the European Commission Revise the CMP Guidelines to enhance the effectiveness of the measures. Review the criterion d) of paragraph 2.2.3(1) of the CMP Guidelines to align it with the other congestion criteria.Establish a date after which the Agency no longer has to produce a congestion report. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-reports-on-contractual-gas-congestion-at-interconnection-points.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0104	2018-05-30	ACER organises a workshop on disruption of gas supply and the value of lost load in power supply systems	 ​On 18 June the Agency will hold a workshop in Brussels on the estimation of the cost of disruption of gas supply (CoDG) and the value of lost load in power supply systems (VoLL) in Europe. The purpose is to develop methodologies which allow the evaluation of CoDG and VoLL in monetary terms per EU Member State per type of consumer or, if not feasible per Member State, at regional level. For that purpose, ACER has contracted studies on the matter, which will be discussed during the workshop. The studies are expected to provide practical results which can be used in the context of updating and improving the gas and electricity cost-benefit analysis (CBA) methodologies in line with the EU Regulation for trans-European energy infrastructure. The current CBA methodologies were developed by the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSOG and ENTSO-E) in the context of assessment of new infrastructure, as well as in the context of the regulation concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply (SoS Regulation). In particular, both studies are expected to provide estimates of CoDG and VoLL to be used for a better monetisation of security of supply aspects in the CBA methodologies (and in the SoS Regulation concerning gas security of supply). You can register and find the preliminary Agenda here. As the premises on which the workshop is to take place have limited seating capacity, participation will be allotted on a first come, first served basis until the seating capacity is fully booked. A real-time webcast of the workshop will be provided.Related to the CoDG study, the Agency invites Industrial and Power Sector users of natural gas in the production process or as a fuel to complete until 12 June 2018 an online Questionnaire​ developed by the consultant contracted by the Agency.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-organises-a-workshop-on-disruption-of-gas-supply-and-the-value-of-lost-load-in-power-supply-systems.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0105	2018-05-18	ACER reports on Cross-Border Cost Allocation Decisions for trans-European energy infrastructure	 ​The Agency publishes today the Third Edition of the Summary Report on Cross-Border Cost Allocation (CBCA) decisions for electricity and gas Projects of Common Interest (PCIs). CBCA decisions are one of the regulatory tools provided by the EU Regulation on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure to facilitate the implementation of PCIs. The purpose of this Report, published ahead of the 2018 edition of the Energy Infrastructure Forum, is to provide a factual review of the CBCA processes. The Report may be useful for project promoters and NRAs dealing with investment requests and CBCA decisions, as well as for interested stakeholders.The Report covers all the 30 investment requests that resulted in CBCA decisions adopted by NRAs (28 instances) and the Agency (2 instances). The main findings are:20 decisions are for gas and 10 for electricity PCIs. However, the decisions have been equally split between the gas and the electricity sectors during the past 2 years;14 decisions were taken in 2014 alone, but since 2015 there was a relatively steady stream of 4 to 6 decisions per year;12 decisions were adopted for PCIs belonging to the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan electricity and gas priority corridors;70% of the decisions are for PCIs located in only one country, while 30% are for interconnectors;Overall investment costs of the projects exceed €12 billion (€7.6 billion in gas and €4.5 billion in electricity);Most of the decisions allocated 100% of the investment costs, but in 8 instances the decisions allocated only part of the investment costs, and counted on public funding to fill the remaining financial gap;Most of the decisions are based on cost-benefit analysis showing net positive impacts in the hosting countries, and therefore allocated the investment costs to the country where the actual costs would be incurred. There are 4 instances of non-hosting countries providing CBCA contributions, all for gas projects, amounting to a total of €130 million. In addition, cross-border compensation payments were decided among the hosting countries amounting to about €130 million;All the project promoter(s) who received CBCA decisions expressed an intention to apply for EU grants for works under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) for energy.The overview and main findings is available here.​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-reports-on-Cross-Border-Cost-Allocation-Decisions-for-trans-European-energy-infrastructure.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0107	2018-05-07	ACER adopts a decision on intraday cross-zonal gate opening and closure time	  The Agency decided that the intraday cross-zonal market shall open at 15:00 market time day-ahead and shall close 60 minutes (30 minutes for Estonia-Finland border) before the start of the relevant market time unit. The Agency expects that, in the forthcoming regional intraday capacity calculation methodologies, TSOs will evaluate and justify how much cross-zonal capacity they will be able to offer to the intraday market and when, taking into account the impact on operational security. You can find the decision and the adopted terms and conditions on the intraday cross-zonal gate opening and closure time here. Link to the decisionLink to the adopted the terms and conditions on the intraday cross-zonal gate opening and closure time   Background In October 2017, the Agency became competent to decide on the proposal from all TSOs on the intraday cross-zonal gate opening and closure time. In January 2018, the Agency consulted all interested stakeholders on this issue (see the details here). All TSOs proposed different intraday cross-zonal gate opening times for different capacity calculation regions due to, according to TSOs, different possibilities to offer leftover cross-zonal capacity from the day-ahead timeframe. The Agency decided that, instead, the intraday cross-zonal gate should open at 15:00 market time day-ahead and that the difficulties with regard to the offering of leftover cross-zonal capacity from the day-ahead timeframe should be addressed and justified in the forthcoming regional intraday capacity calculation methodologies. The regulatory authorities will then need to decide on this proposal.With regard to the intraday cross-zonal gate closure time, the Agency approved the TSOs proposal. However, the Agency deemed it necessary to clarify the definition of market time unit on the bidding zone border in order the ensure legal enforceability of this definition. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-adopts-a-decision-on-intraday-cross-zonal-gate-opening-and-closure-time.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0114	2018-03-22	ACER publishes guidance on capacity hoarding in intraday electricity markets that could constitute market manipulation	 ​With the aim of ensuring the integrity of valuable EU cross-border trading capacities, ACER publishes today a guidance note on capacity hoarding in intraday electricity markets that could constitute market manipulation under REMIT (EU Regulation on Wholesale Market Integrity and Transparency). Capacity hoarding consists of the acquisition of available transmission capacity without using it or without using it effectively. In Europe, cross-border capacities for electricity in the intraday time frame couple markets and open up opportunities to trade close to real time. If efficiently used, they reduce the need for balancing services and thus contribute to lower network fees, which benefit all consumers.Currently these capacities represent approximately 27% of the total available*. Due to the growing importance of intermittent generation, intraday cross-border trading is expected to grow further in the coming years.The Agency is committed to ensuring that available capacities benefit European consumers of electricity. In particular, the guidance note aims to advise National Regulatory Authorities for energy on how to assess the hoarding of valuable transmission capacities under REMIT.The guidance note on transmission capacity hoarding is available here.The updated ACER Guidance (4th edition) on the application of REMIT can be found here​.*Estimated value, based on, intraday offered capacities in the ‘economic’ direction and national intraday volumes for a selection of EU borders in 2016, considering the extrapolation of the results to all the EU borders.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-guidance-on-capacity-hoarding-in-intraday-electricity-markets-that-could-constitute-market-manipulation.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0121	2017-12-21	ACER publishes its monitoring report on the Inter-Transmission System Operator Compensation mechanism	 The Agency released today its Report on the implementation of the Inter-Transmission System Operator Compensation (ITC) mechanism in 2016. According to EU legislation, ACER annually reviews the implementation of this mechanism and the management of the ITC Fund established by ENTSO-E for the purpose of compensating TSOs for the costs incurred on national transmission systems due to hosting cross-border flows of electricity.  The Agency notes in its latest report that the losses component of the ITC Fund, further increased slightly compared to 2015, reaching €158.5 million (+ 3.6%). This was mainly triggered by an increase in the volume of losses incurred by transit. At the same time the weighted average value of losses used for the 2016 ITC mechanism decreased.

For example, market participants can report to the relevant National Regulatory Authority(s) for energy and ACER suspicious transactions, delayed disclosure of inside information and transactions to cover immediate physical loss in respect of the exemption of the prohibition of insider trading.The Notification Platform is accessible through the REMIT portal​.  	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-launches-an-improved-version-of-the-REMIT-Notification-Platform.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0123	2017-12-06	Montenegro joins ACER Working Groups	 ​ACER Director, Alberto Pototschnig, and the President of the National Regulatory Agency of Montenegro (RAE), Branislav Prelević, signed today an Administrative Arrangement which will allow experts from RAE to join the Agency’s Electricity Working Group and Gas Working Group as of January 2018. The working groups, composed of representatives of ACER, national regulators and the European Commission, provide input to the Director for the preparation of opinions, recommendations and decisions and provide information to the Agency’s Board of Regulators on the issues relevant to the Director’s proposals. Participation in ACER’s working groups is in general limited to EU regulatory authorities, however admission of third country’s regulators is possible when the country has made satisfactory progress towards adopting and applying EU law in the field of energy, as well as the measures ensuring the effective independence of its NRA. The Agency was supported in the assessment of the implementation of the EU energy acquis in Montenegro by the Energy Community Secretariat.On the occasion of the signature of the Administrative Agreement, Director Pototschnig stated:  “I am very pleased that RAE joins the Agency’s working groups as the first national regulator from the Energy Community Contracting Parties.” Janez Kopač, Director of the Energy Community Secretariat, said that “today's event represent the essence of the Energy Community, which is dedicated to bringing together EU and its neighbours which are part of the same internal market. They cannot be really part of the same family if they are not part of the same institutions. Montenegro is the most advanced Energy Community country, without a single infringement procedure and am sure will be a most reliable partner”.President Prelević thanked the support of the Energy Community and its Secretariat and stressed that “RAE feels honoured with this observer chair at ACER”. “We will try to continue developing our institutional capacities further – he added - and will also try to give back through active participation in ACER working groups, as we have done so during the last several years within the ECRB working groups”.Find more about ACER working groups here​.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Montenegro-joins-ACER-Working-Groups.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0124	2017-12-04	ACER reports on implementation of Interoperability and Data Exchange Network Code	 ​The Agency publishes today its first ACER Report on the implementation of the Interoperability and Data Exchange Network Code, which aims at aligning the complex technical procedures used between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and between TSOs and network users within the EU. The Report explores the effectiveness of the implementation of this code in the EU Member States. Rules on interoperability and data exchange cover ways in which network operators manage gas flows across borders, deal with differences in gas quality and exchange data between themselves and market players. The Code is applicable since 1 May 2016.The Report evaluates the key features of the national implementation and reflects on the extent to which they achieve the primary objectives of the Code. To compare these approaches, the Report uses an assessment tool which describes in a standard manner the different national approaches to interoperability and data exchange. It provides conclusions and recommendations to strengthen the application of this code across the EU.The Report contains an enhanced review of the country assessments for 19 Member States: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Denmark, Greece, Spain, France Croatia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Slovenia, Slovakia and United Kingdom. The Report focuses on Interconnection Agreements, Gas Quality and Odourisation, and Data Exchange. Main findings:Most Interconnection Agreements -arrangements among TSOs at a given interconnection point- are in place, but regulatory supervision is insufficient. The Agency observes that the quality of the Interconnection Agreements could be improved. National Regulatory Authorities for Energy (NRAs) should proactively assess the Interconnection Agreements in place using the standard methodology set in the Report. Alternatively, NRAs with less or limited technical resources may delegate this assessment to the Agency.The harmonisation of data exchanges is not achieved yet. The process faced initial delays and it is still on-going. As an outcome, the standard developed by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas is not applied everywhere in the European Union.While Gas Quality and Odourisation do not currently cause barriers to trade, the transparency standard set in the Code is not met, in particular regarding information on short-term gas quality variations.NRAs should promote the implementation of the ENTSOG Data Exchange standard by TSOs, called the Common Network Operation Tool (“CNOT”).The Agency will further monitor the evolution of the implementation of the provisions of the Code in the coming years with a focus on the outstanding issues.Access the report here.Additional links:Interoperability page on Network Code and code developmentEU Regulation establishing a network code on interoperability and data exchange rulesEU Regulation on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks ​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-reports-on-implementation-of-Interoperability-and-Data-Exchange-Network-Code-.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0128	2017-11-16	Second ACER Report on the implementation of the Balancing Network Code available online	" The Agency publishes today its second Report on the implementation of the Balancing Network Code​, which sheds light on the different features of balancing design. Rules on gas balancing aim at facilitating gas trading across European Union balancing zones and at contributing to the development of short-term markets and their liquidity. Harmonised Union-wide rules on balancing have the objective to create an appropriate environment for network users to manage their balance positions in the different balancing zones of the Union in an economically efficient and comparable way.  The Report describes the status of the implementation and application of the Code across the EU Member States. The Code is applicable since 1 October 2015. The implementation challenge is greater for those Member States that have not yet enabled short-term markets. For its second Report, the Agency developed a new Balancing Analytical Framework to allow effective balancing regime comparison by quantifying the performances for the balancing regimes of National Grid Group (GB-UK), the H-Cal Zone Fluxys (BeLux), NCG (Germany), Energinet.dk (Denmark), GRTgaz Nord (France), Plinovodi (Slovenia) and Enagas (Spain). This year, the Agency has also acquired a better understanding about a broader set of balancing regimes, including the ones most lagging behind (Romania, Bulgaria and Greece). In addition the Report aims to continue the assessment of the various balancing regimes across the EU. In this context, it presents the results of an enhanced review of the country assessments for 26 balancing zones, updated for this year, using the same evaluation framework as last year  Main findings:​ The implementation of the Code is still patchy: some regimes are in a well-developed stage, while others have made some or no progress at all. NRAs and TSOs should work together with market players to progress the implementation of the Balancing Code by promoting greater access to short-term commercial opportunities, lively trading platforms, and revision of the limited access to transit infrastructures. 	 Consumer benefits can only be reaped where markets work effectively. The Agency promotes the use of the Balancing Analytical Framework to assess balancing regime effectiveness and further the evolution of these regimes. 	 The Balancing Analytical Framework builds strongly on analysing neutrality, which is a key indicator to understand robust gas accounting and wider regime performance. Another aim of the Balancing Analytical Framework is to make initial steps to understand the underlying relationship between the physical linepack -volume of gas in the system at a given point in time- and commercial imbalances, the latter including both TSO actions and network users imbalances, to help improve the effectiveness of the operational regime. 	 The Agency looks forward to acquiring good information for all the indicators used in the Report to enable future monitoring, including better linepack information. The Agency requests that ENTSOG facilitates the usage of the Balancing Analytical Framework and the collection of the relevant data applied by this framework.Useful Links: Balancing page on Network Code and code developmentFirst ACER report and Early Implementation Reports         First ACER Report on the implementation of the Balancing Network Code on 7 November 2016 Second ACER-ENTSOG Report on the status of the implementation of the Balancing Network Code on 5 November 2015         ACER-ENTSOG Report on the early implementation of the Balancing Network Code (BAL NC)​ on 22 October 2014 ​​​"	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Second-ACER-Report-on-the-implementation-of-the-Balancing-Network-Code-available-online.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0129	2017-11-07	ACER publishes its first Implementation Monitoring Report on Requirements for Generators	 In the first implementation monitoring report​ of its kind, the Agency finds that implementation of the Network Code on Requirements for Grid Connection of Generators (NC RfG) is well on track. However, full implementation is still outstanding in the areas of the publication of criteria for granting derogations and the transitional arrangements for emerging technologies. The basis for this assessment is the non-binding guidance on implementation by ENTSO-E and the list of the relevant information for implementation monitoring by the Agency.    Based on National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) answers to questionnaires and detailed analyses, the first Implementation Monitoring Report of the Network Code on Requirements for Grid Connection of Generators delivers the following recommendations:   ​Granting derogations: the Agency understands NRAs may amend the criteria for granting derogations once per year at the most. The Agency recommends that, in doing so, NRAs take into account best practice, as shared in the framework of the Agency.    Transitional arrangements for emerging technologies: the Agency recommends NRAs to coordinate any withdrawal of classification as emerging technology with other NRAs, using the framework of the Agency. Also, the Agency recommends that the cumulative maximum capacity of power-generating modules classified as emerging technologies for each Member State be published on a dedicated website. All NRAs and/or other authorities, where applicable in Member States, should commit to provide the Agency with relevant information on a regular basis.    NRA empowerment: the lack of NRA empowerment for the approval and withdrawal of classification as emerging technology influences the efficiency of coordination at the Synchronous Area level. Therefore, the Agency urges MSs to empower their NRAs for the approval and withdrawal of classification as emerging technology, so as to ensure that all relevant information is taken into account when deciding on the approval and withdrawal of classification as emerging technology.Access the report here​.     ​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-its-first-Implementation-Monitoring-Report-on-Requirements-for-Generators.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0130	2017-10-24	Households and businesses benefit from falling EU energy prices	 Electricity and gas retail prices generally fell in the EU for both household and industrial consumers. European households paid 8.4% less for their gas in 2016 compared to 2015, mostly thanks to improved gas markets, while the electricity household prices went down by 2.1% - first registered decrease for households since 2008 - thanks to the steady decline of electricity wholesale prices in recent years.  The Annual Report on the Results of Monitoring the Internal Electricity and Natural Gas Markets​ was presented today in Brussels by the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER). For the first time, the Report includes some data on the Energy Community Contracting Parties.  Barrier to further EU energy market integration still persist  EU energy prices fell thanks to improved gas market functioning, among other factors, and despite limited capacity available for electricity cross-border trading. Hence, European energy regulators see opportunities for further benefits for EU energy consumers. For example, electricity Transmission System Operators (TSOs) should make a larger share of the existing cross-border capacity available for trading, given that only half of what is technically possible is offered today to the market.   Commenting on this significant barrier to market integration, Alberto Pototschnig, ACER Director, called for “more TSO coordination and the equal treatment of intra-zonal and cross-zonal exchanges of power, so as to deliver additional benefits to consumers”.   Gas markets are working better in terms of hub functioning and price convergence, with the volume of hub-traded gas increasing by 20% from 2015 to 2016. But, important barriers remain, in particular in South-East Europe, that negatively affect market functioning and liquidity.  Whilst the EU gas network codes are making a difference for the better, market conditions, including oversupply and overcapacity, limit their impact. Further TSO and NRA coordination on network codes implementation will enhance market integration.  Switching supplier should be even faster and reliable comparison tools are needed  Consumer protection and empowerment rights are generally well established. Disconnection rate are about 1% (for electricity and gas). The time it takes to switch supplier has improved (now 12 working days), but is still longer than the 24-hour switching period that regulators would like to see, and it takes 5-6 weeks to receive the final bill after switching supplier.    Smart meter roll across Europe is low (25% of electricity households and only 4 countries for gas) and not enough countries have reliable comparison tools (22 in electricity and 18 in gas). Lord Mogg, Chair of ACER’s Board of Regulators and CEER President, said: “Consumers’ empowerment is essential. Reliable comparison tools are a must. Switching within 24-hours is the target. Bills must be kept simple and smart meters must have minimum functionalities that deliver benefits for consumers”.  The Energy Community Secretariat’s Director Janez Kopač said: “The present report, which for the first time also encompasses Contracting Parties of the Energy Community, brings us closer in the realisation of the pan-European Energy Union. Internal energy market integration efforts must not stop at the EU’s borders and this report is a stepping stone in the construction of the Energy Union's governance”. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Households-and-businesses-benefit-from-falling-EU-energy-prices.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0131	2017-10-06	Continued gas wholesale market integration, but electricity market integration at risk	 The latest ACER-CEER Market Monitoring Report (MMR), whose wholesale and retail volumes were published today, shows that for electricity wholesale markets the limited amount of cross-zonal capacity made available for trading by TSOs is one of the most significant barriers to further market integration in Europe. Ensuring the equal treatment of internal - within bidding-zones - and cross-zonal exchanges, as well as increasing the level of TSO coordination, are utmost priorities to overcome this situation.  Gas markets are working better in terms of hub functioning and price convergence, but the situation is diverse geographically. Important barriers remain in some Member States, in particular in South-East Europe, negatively affecting market functioning and liquidity.  The gas network codes, where implemented, bring a positive impact.  The downward trend of wholesale energy prices (both electricity and gas) continued in most of the EU in 2016. Retail prices are also showing more and more a downward trend. For electricity for industrial consumers and for gas, this has already been the case for a couple of years, but this now also extends to electricity household prices.  This MMR also covers the Energy Community Contracting Parties for some retail and gas wholesale topics, thanks to the support and cooperation of the Energy Community Secretariat. Industrial electricity and gas prices in these countries tend to be higher than household prices, with an upward trend for households and a downward one for industrial consumers.  The results of the MMR will be presented in Brussels on October 24th. Registration can be done via the ACER website.

ACER_NEWS_0133	2017-09-25	ACER Work Programme for 2018 is available online	 The Agency’s 2018 Programming Document, which includes the 2018 Work Programme, was published today, following its adoption last week by ACER’s Administrative Board. The document, which was previously approved by the Board of Regulators, is now available online here. As in previous years, the document is structured according the format of the Programming Document for EU Agencies. The Agency’s multiannual outlook for the 2018 – 2020 period has been updated, but remains fully consistent with the one published last year. Pending the adoption and the entry into force of the legislative acts of the Commission’s “Clean Energy for all Europeans” package, the Agency’s legal mandate and priorities remain, for the time-being, the same as those in 2017. The document thus focuses on the four main areas on which the Agency expects to concentrate its activities: the (post-2014) completion of the Internal Energy Market, the infrastructure challenge, the monitoring of wholesale energy markets and the longer-term regulatory challenges such as the integration of renewables.  As an innovation with respect to previous years, however, the tasks in the 2018 Work Programme have been classified according to three priority levels (critical, important and relevant). As in 2017, the monitoring of trading in EU wholesale energy markets on the basis of the reported trade and fundamental data remains one of the Agency’s main challenges. The Agency’s effectiveness in such a monitoring activity continues to depend crucially on it being assigned the significant additional resources that it has been requesting since 2014, and which the Agency is again requesting for 2018.  Access all the work programmes of the Agency here. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-Work-Programme-for-2018-is-available-online.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0138	2017-08-30	ACER workshop on Harmonized Allocation Rules for long-term electricity transmission rights	 The Agency is organising a workshop in Ljubljana on 11 September on the main body of the Harmonized Allocation Rules (HAR) for long-term electricity transmission rights submitted by all TSOs in accordance with the EU Regulation establishing a Guideline on Forward Capacity Allocation. Harmonized Allocation Rules aim at creating a level-playing field across Europe.      The National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) did not reach an agreement on the required credit rating for banks issuing collaterals for market participants and have requested ACER to take a decision.      You can register for the workshop here​.      Background      On 17 August 2017, the Agency received a letter on behalf of all NRAs requesting it to adopt a decision pursuant to Article 4(10) of Regulation 2016/1719 on the all Transmission System Operators (TSOs)’ proposal for HAR.      The point of disagreement among NRAs lies in the provisions of Article 21(1)h of the proposed HAR, concerning the required credit rating for banks issuing collaterals for market participants: while the TSOs’ proposal states that, in case of an industry-wide downgrade of financial institutions, the Allocation Platform may decrease the required rating below BBB+ for a limited period of time, one NRA would prefer instead either (i) to maintain the default required credit rating level BBB+ even though there is an industry-wide downgrade, or (ii) to delete all provisions of credit rating and leave the decision completely to TSOs.      On 26 August, in compliance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) 713/2009, the Agency launched a consultation among the national regulatory authorities and the transmission system operators concerned. This consultation will remain open until 8 September.      In addition, the Agency would also like to give other stakeholders a chance to provide comments on its proposal.      The Agency’s proposal for an amended version of the HAR is attached to this invitation. This version keeps the TSOs’ proposal as regards Article 21(1)h and includes a few other minor amendments (mainly for clarification and alignment with the Regulation 2016/1719) already communicated by NRAs early this year.       	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-workshop-on-Harmonized-Allocation-Rules-for-long-term-electricity-transmission-rights.aspx

Other comments on the proposals are also welcome.  All interested stakeholders are invited to submit their comments by 15 September 2017, 23.59 hrs (CET).                The decision on these proposals will be taken in accordance with the CACM Regulation.                 More information this consultation can be find here​.                                   	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-consults-on-the-maximum-and-minimum-prices-in-the-day-ahead-and-intraday-coupling.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0140	2017-08-01	ACER and ENTSOG upgrade the functionality platform to support the implementation of gas network codes	 From today, the functionality platform launched by ACER and ENTSOG last year to gather potential implementation issues with the gas network codes, allows more stakeholders to provide feedback on a wider range of topics.                   The “Functionality Process for Gas Network Codes” is a process which was set up jointly by ACER and ENTSOG with the support of the European Commission. To facilitate this process, the functionality platform was developed as a web based tool to allow all relevant parties (as defined in the tool’s Terms of Use), to participate by addressing their issues, as well as to get involved in the development of proposals of issue solutions.                   Alberto Pototschnig, ACER Director commented that the enlarged scope of the Functionality Platform shows the Agency’s commitment to promote stakeholder engagement in the implementation of Network Codes. We continue to encourage stakeholders to put forward gas Network Code issues, so that the Agency in cooperation with the European Commission and ENTSOG can deal with them in a structured way.’                    One of the new features of the functionality platform is the posting of an issue by any relevant party, not only by those directly affected. In addition, any issue regarding a network code and guidelines can be reported, not only implementation issues. Issues which have been addressed previously will be reconsidered if a material change can be shown. A preliminary and indicative assessment of costs and benefits of the proposed solution may also be undertaken.                    ACER and ENTSOG would like to invite stakeholders to comment on the new scope of the functionality process before the 30 September 2017. Please navigate to a-two question survey using the following link.                    The “functionality platform” is available here​.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-and-ENTSOG-upgrade-the-functionality-platform-to-support-the-implementation-of-gas-network-codes.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0143	2017-07-07	ACER finds a mixed picture in the implementation of Infrastructure Projects of Common Interest	 ACER published today its third consolidated annual report on the progress of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) in electricity and gas. The report examines how the projects on the second EU list of PCIs (adopted in November 2015) evolved, with a focus on the 12-month period from January 2016 to January 2017. The Agency’s main findings are the following:   Several promoters of electricity and gas PCIs reported progress in the implementation of the projects and an advancement in their status compared to 2016. In most instances, the projects entered the permit granting process after completing earlier project development stages. In contrast, some PCIs did not report on any work or activity being done since 2015, which casts doubt on the viability of these projects. Approximately half of the PCIs fell behind last year’s schedule. In electricity, this was mainly due to delays in permitting, while in gas it was typically due to rescheduling (i.e. voluntary postponement by a promoter, for example, due to less urgent need for the investment or re-prioritisation of the project vis-à-vis other investments). Over the last two years, only one-third of all the PCIs have managed to keep their original commissioning date. The investment costs, as estimated and reported by the promoters, amount to €49.8 billion for electricity PCIs and €52.7 billion for gas PCIs. Since 2015, promoters have spent approximately €6 billion on gas and €4.3 billion on electricity PCIs. Regarding the benefits which the projects would bring, in electricity the reported monetised benefits amount to €66.1 billion. The Agency was not able to evaluate the benefits of the gas PCIs as the promoters did not provide sufficient monetised benefits data for gas projects, due to a lack of monetisation of benefits in the ENTSOG CBA methodology. The interest of the promoters in using the regulatory tools made available by Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 and exemptions remained low.  The report is ​a​vailable here​.         	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-finds-a-mixed-picture-in-the-implementation-of-Infrastructure-Projects-of-Common-Interest-.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0144	2017-07-03	ACER calls for stakeholders to join new Expert group on wholesale energy market trading	 The Agency launches today a call for a new consultative expert group on wholesale energy market trading. This group will advise the Agency on topics related to the EU Regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT) replacing the Ad hoc REMIT Expert Group, which ended on 28 February 2017.       The group will mainly focus on providing advice on REMIT policy matters, including compliance with the obligation on market participants to disclose inside information, as well as other EU regulations impacting on energy trading and market functioning regulation on energy markets, including financial market regulation. It may also be called on to provide advice on the REMIT Regulation more broadly in order to develop proposals for any future review.      As previous Expert Groups, it may submit opinions and advice on any issue related to the tasks of the Agency according to REMIT, with particular focus on the above-mentioned areas.       The deadline for applications is 31 July 2017.      The deadline for applications has been extended until Monday 14 August 2017.

ACER_NEWS_0145	2017-06-30	Norman Bay, former Chairman of US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission visits ACER	 Norman Bay, the former Chairman of the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), this week visited the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). The visit was organised to coincide with ACER’s 2017 Annual Conference “Regions for the Internal Energy Market”, held yesterday, at which the former FERC Chairman delivered a keynote speech. On Wednesday, Mr Bay met with ACER’s experts from the operational departments to exchange views on developments in European and US energy markets. Mr Bay’s visit was concluded today with a general meeting with ACER staff, in which he provided insights into the US energy sector and its regulation.            Mr Bay served as FERC Commissioner in 2014 and 2015, when he was appointed FERC Chairman, a position that he held until January 2017. He previously served as Director of the Office of Enforcement at FERC and as US Attorney for the District of New Mexico.                   	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Norman-Bay,-former-Chairman-of-US-Federal-Energy-Regulatory-Commission-visits-ACER.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0146	2017-06-29	Regional cooperation: cornerstone of the Energy Union Governance	 European Commission Vice-President for the Energy Union, Maroš Šefčovič, highlighted today that cooperation among Member States in different regions of the EU will be a cornerstone of the Energy Union Governance. “I am a strong believer that the road to the fully integrated energy system in Europe leads through an improved and intensified cooperation at regional level”, he said while connecting live from Bratislava during his keynote speech at ACER’s Annual Conference 2017.       In his opening speech, ACER Director Alberto Pototschnig underlined the successful experience in the past with regional voluntary cooperation: “Without such an early implementation effort, EU consumers would have had to wait a lot longer, and most probably would still be waiting, before reaping the benefits of an integrated internal energy market”. The Conference, entitled “Regions for the Internal Energy Market”, was structured in three sessions, focussing respectively on which aspects are best dealt at regional level, the geographical scope of regional cooperation and the governance and regulatory aspects.     The “Clean Energy for all Europeans” package presented by the Commission in November promotes strong regional cooperation as the most efficient and effective means to reach the Energy Union objectives. According to the Commission, better regional cooperation among governments, regulators, transmission system operators and even research centres will lead to a fully integrated energy system at EU level, which will bring savings of up to 9 billion euros a year compared to a purely national approach.               What will ACER do in this context?       The November Package foresees a stronger role for ACER in coordinating regional decision-making. Among other new tasks, ACER will oversee Regional Operational Centres for Transmission System Operators (TSOs), supervise nominated electricity market operators and develop the methodologies for the EU wide generation adequacy assessment.               Morten Helveg Petersen, Vice-Chair of the European Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) underlined in a video message that “ACER’s job is absolutely key in order to ensure a well-functioning energy market that will benefit all energy consumers all over Europe”. However, “ACER should have adequate resources and the tools to conduct oversight, and the Agency currently lacks both,” he said. Petersen also suggested that for a stable funding of the Agency, the institutions should look into the possibility of ACER being able to collect fees for certain services.       The Conference opened with a welcome address by the Slovenian Minister of Infrastructure, Peter Gašperšič. Consumer associations also intervened on their expectations from the regional approach to market integration. One of the highlights of the day was a keynote speech by Norman Bay, former Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of the United States. The sessions were moderated by Lord Mogg, Chair of ACER’s Board of Regulators; Dr Romana Jordan, Chair of ACER’s Administrative Board; and Mr Andris Piebalgs, Chair of ACER’s Board of Appeal. The concluding remarks were provided by Dominique Ristori, European Commission Director General for Energy.              You can access the Conference website here.       	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Regional-cooperation-cornerstone-of-the-Energy-Union-Governance.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0147	NULL	ACER still finds contractual congestion in the European Gas Transmission Network	 The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) publishes today its fourth report on Contractual Congestion, a situation in which the level of firm capacity demand exceeds the technical capacity. ACER has identified congestion at 9% of the entry and exist sides of the Interconnection Points (‘IPs’) within the EU Gas Transmission Network. This year only 23 interconnection sides out of the 247 IPs analysed were congested, compared to the 41 out of 246 identified in the Agency’s previous report. On the other hand, for another 55 IP sides the Gas Year 2017/18 product was not offered in 2016. In 2015 only 23 IP sides were in a similar condition. This means that it is difficult to assess whether contractual congestion has improved overall in Europe. At the congested points a slight increase of FDA UIOLI was observed, and no application of Oversubscription & Buy Back has been identified.  This Report develops on the list of contractually congested IPs where the Firm Day Ahead Use-It-or-Lose-It (‘FDA UIOLI’) mechanism has to be applied, as of 1 July, in order to guarantee that unused capacity will be brought back to the market. It also reveals to what extent the other Congestion Management Procedures (‘CMP’) have been applied in the European Union and the amount of additional capacity yielded through their use.  The findings of this Report are based on the analysis of data from the Transparency Platform (TP) for 2016 – 2018 of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG). The study has also used data from the three capacity booking platforms (PRISMA, RBP and GSA), using the auction results for 2016 and March 2017.  How much congestion? Contractual congestion was identified at 23 IP sides, 17 of which had already been identified as congested in the previous version of the report. For 14 IP sides, contractual congestion was triggered by the non-offer of firm products with the duration of at least one month, whereas the use of auction premia and unsuccessful requests indicated contractual congestion for other 9 IP sides.  Where?   More than half of the contractual congestion occurred at cross-border IPs between Germany and its neighbours and at inland German IP sides. Around 10 IP sides were congested in the South and South South-East Regions.  Has any progress been achieved?   Secondary capacity trades have been concluded only for 7 congested IP sides. Data availability on the secondary market has further increased this year.  What next?   For the 10 congested IP sides where the FDA UIOLI has still not been implemented and the other 3 German IP sides where FDA UIOLI was not duly reported, National Regulatory Authorities (‘NRAs’) should take the relevant measures, which include:  To require TSOs to implement and apply the FDA UIOLI mechanism or prove that the congested situation is unlikely to reoccur in the following three years. To improve TSO data reporting. ACER’s main recommendations to NRAs, ENTSOG and TSOs    Improve data reliability: CMP data availability needs to be further improved by ENTSOG/TSOs, by ensuring that auction results with premia and data on all non-available capacity products are uploaded on the ENTSOG’s TP, as required by the CMP Guidelines. ENTSOG’s TP should also aim to incorporate information on bundled capacities. ACER’s recommendation to the European Commission Revise the CMP Guidelines to enhance the effectiveness of the measures. Offer more flexibility with regards to the application of the FDA UIOLI. Review the fourth criterion of the CMP Guidelines with regard to the Firm day-ahead use-it-or-lose-it mechanism (where no firm capacity product with a duration of one month or more has been offered) to align it with the other congestion criteria. Define contractual congestion for the day-ahead timeframes between hubs. Establish a deadline by which the Agency shall produce congestion reports in the future.

ACER_NEWS_0149	2017-05-11	Regulators call for priority dispatch of existing Renewables to be removed	 Today Energy Regulators (ACER and CEER), in their White Paper on Renewables in the Wholesale Market, called for EU legislators to bring Renewable Energy Sources (RES) fully into the market in the clean energy transition. Regulators recommend 3 changes to the European Commission’s Clean Energy proposals.                   Remove priority dispatch for existing Renewables Extend the prohibition of priority dispatch (i.e. priority running) also to existing RES plants (and not only to new RES as proposed by the Commission), so that all technologies complete fairly in the market to deliver the lowest possible cost to consumers.                    Avoid non-market approach to redispatch and RES curtailment                    Remove the proposed 90% compensation for RES curtailment. Regulators support the proposals for market-based prices being the driver for compensation paid to renewables that are curtailed when there is congestion, and for Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to perform market-based (rather than technology-based) curtailments.                    Avoid net metering and ensure fair cost allocation                    Avoid net metering to ensure that self-generators pay their fair share of network and system costs. Alberto Pototschnig, ACER Director, remarked that “as European Energy Regulators, we believe that the Clean Energy Package should ensure that, when it comes to participation in the market, all technologies compete on a level-laying field. This requires market-based dispatching of all resources.”                    Lord Mogg, Chair of ACER Board of Regulators and CEER President added “regulators support the Clean Energy efforts to make renewables central to the market and to allow consumers be prosumers. The integration of renewables must be fair and cost-efficient and without cross subsidisation between renewable self-generators and other consumers.”                    RES White Paper is the first in series of Regulatory White Papers                    This Renewables White Paper is the first in a series of the European Energy Regulators’ White Papers on the Clean Energy proposals covering wholesale, network and consumer issues. These White Papers build on the “European Energy Regulators’ Overview Paper - Initial Reactions to the European Commission’s Proposals on Clean Energy​”, published by CEER and ACER on 23 January”.                     ​​ Find out more in the related press release here.                                    ​​        	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Regulators-call-for-priority-dispatch-of-existing-Renewables-to-be-removed.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0150	2017-05-03	The Network Codes for the Energy Union: Joining forces on implementation	" “Fairer prices and more choice for European energy consumers”, this is the goal of the energy liberalisation and market integration. Network codes, jointly developed by the European Commission, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the European Network for Transmission System Operators for gas and electricity, (ENTSOG and ENTSO-E), with the key involvement of stakeholders, provide European answers on technical and market issues. By the end of 2017 they will all be adopted. It is time to look into achievements but also the implementation and monitoring challenges. A joint conference​ is organised in Brussels to celebrate this common achievement and to discuss the next steps.       In 2009, European market participants faced barriers to entry, cross-border congestions, limited interconnections, lack of competition and transparency to name a few. Regulatory heterogeneity translated into limited trading volumes and price spreads between countries. The Third Energy Package and the network codes aimed to tackle this situation.   Where are we now?       The cooperation among Transmission System Operators (TSOs) is ensured through the ENTSOs. ACER’s establishment contributes to reinforcing cooperation by National Regulatory Authorities and to filling the regulatory gap resulting from market integration as national regulators have responsibilities over their national jurisdictions. Europeans benefit from more security of supply and better network planning. System operation and market rules have been harmonised and are more transparent. Greater stakeholders’ participation was crucial in developing robust proposals.       The various network codes for electricity and gas are in different stages of implementation but conference organisers already emphasise their added value:       For Klaus-Dieter Borchardt, European Commission: “The network codes lead to the opening of markets, to the unhindered flow of electricity and gas across Europe and to the improvement of the Internal Energy Markets. These integrated markets will bring benefits to the consumers such as more competition, fairer prices and diversified services.”       Alberto Pototschnig, ACER, comments that ‘as the network codes are now being implemented and enforced by National Regulatory Authorities, the benefits which we were expecting, in terms of greater market integration, promoting increased competition and enhanced security of supply, and more efficient use of infrastructure are materialising. In the electricity sector, market coupling is already providing benefits in the order of 1 billion euros per year. In this and in other areas, more benefits are still to be delivered”’. In addition, Lord Mogg noted that “the challenge is to make sure that these benefits reach consumers. The most recent evidence from the Agency’s market monitoring activity shows that this is finally happening"".       Laurent Schmitt, ENTSO-E, “Network codes have proven to be powerful instruments in tackling market & renewables integration even if a lot of work still lays ahead. The energy transition is increasing the need for flexible services. The digitisation of the power system is raising questions regarding cybersecurity. EU codes on distributed flexibility and cybersecurity may be needed sooner than later. Co-creation, collaboration and transparency will be our focus there”, insisted Laurent Schmitt, ENTSO-E Secretary-General.       Jan Ingwersen, ENTSOG, concludes that: ‘The balanced process was a key to the success of the initial development of the gas network codes. When it comes to the further development of the network codes in the sake of the European energy market, we should establish a process that will be clear, consistent and inclusive for all the stakeholders. To improve the functionality of the NCs, ENTSOG is continuously developing tailor made facilitation and advice for European TSOs and continues dialogue with the market players.’       All parties underline the need for full and timely implementation of the codes to unlock all the benefits for European consumers.       To allow all interested parties to participate, even remotely, the European Network Codes Conference will be web streamed​. The Commission, ACER and the ENTSOs set up an online training with the Florence School of Regulation and will develop other initiatives to share network codes value with a broad audience. They will cooperate on implementation and amendments but also potentially new codes. The participation of stakeholders in all this is central.      About the Network Codes:      The Network Codes are sets of rules applying to the energy sector, aiming at harmonising and coordinating the different processes of the energy markets and systems. All Network Codes have entered or will enter into force one by one and be an integral part of the European Regulations, covering topics for gas (such as harmonised transmission tariff structures, balancing rules, capacity allocation mechanisms and interoperability rules) and for electricity (such as market integration, grid connection, and operational security).      ACER’s vision for a successful implementation of the Network Codes​        "	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/The-Network-Codes-for-the-Energy-Union-Joining-forces-on-implementation.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0152	2017-04-10	Survey commissioned by ACER finds market participants still experiencing barriers to EU gas wholesale market trading	 ​The Agency publishes today the results of a survey conducted among wholesale market participants - mainly shippers, suppliers, traders and energy intensive customers - across the EU on the remaining barriers to gas wholesale market trading. The survey was commissioned by the Agency and conducted by a Consultant. The results of the survey provide input into the assessment of developments in gas wholesale markets which the Agency performs every year for the preparation of its Market Monitoring Report (MMR). In fact, one of the legal requirements of the MMR is to detect and assess market barriers hindering the implementation of the European Internal Energy Market. However, at this stage the results of the survey only reflect the opinions of those market participants that participated in the survey. They do not necessarily reflect the views of the Agency nor those of the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs). The main identified barriers were categorised by the Consultant by hub development category. Whereas the most important barriers for established, advanced and emerging hubs overlap to a large degree - albeit at different levels of intensity - those experienced in illiquid hubs differ significantly.      Main barriers identified by market participants in established, advanced and emerging hubs  For established hubs (Great Britain, Netherlands), advanced hubs (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy) and emerging hubs (Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland, Spain): non-competitive transmission tariffs, for both short-term and long-term capacity and non-competitive short-term capacity products at interconnection points.       ​Regulatory transparency related to transmission tariffs at the interconnection points (methodology and setting) and the overall regulatory framework such as consultations, could be further enhanced.       Main barriers identified by market participants in illiquid hubs For illiquid hubs (Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia) weakpolitical support to wholesale market development and the absence of an organised gas hub are cited the most.       Insufficient flexibility in the products offered at the hub and/or at the exchange as well as a lack of a reference (or at least import) wholesale price or unclear price formation mechanism are other major barriers.       The Consultant’s report can be downloaded here. You can find the latest Market Monitoring Report here. The Agency intends to publish a new edition covering 2016 in November.​     	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Survey-commissioned-by-ACER-finds-market-participants-still-experiencing-barriers-to-EU-gas-wholesale-market-trading.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0153	2017-04-07	ACER calls for further improvements in Union-wide and national electricity network development plans	 ​The Agency has recently published two opinions on electricity network development plans, one on the draft Union-wide Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP 2016) and another one regarding its consistency with the national network development plans. ACER finds the draft TYNDP 2016 prepared by ENTSO-E has improved when compared with previous plans, but it also identifies some shortcomings. Among them, insufficient alignment with the national network development plans.          ACER Opinion on draft Union-wide Ten-Year Network Development Plan 2016       The ACER Opinion on the draft TYNDP 2016 considers that the plan has improved in identifying the economic-efficient target capacities at 10 boundaries of the European system where power exchange bottlenecks were identified, corresponding to more than 30 individual borders. ACER also finds the scenario development included in the plan better prepared and explained. It also praises the classification of projects into “mid-term”, “long-term” or “future projects” categories, reflecting different advancement level and implementation dates, and the analysis of a mid-term study horizon for 2020 in addition to the one for 2030.          Suggested improvements for the plan at EU level include:        Further transparency about the TYNDP building process and calculation of target capacities; Process for selecting projects to be included in the TYNDP; Explanation of the link between the projects and the infrastructure investment needs; Provision of the target capacities for each boundary, solely based on technical-economic assessments; Assessment of resilience of the system and of security of supply benefits by each project; Adequacy forecast and its linkage to the TYNDP; Overall fitness of the TYNDP for the selection of the projects of common interest. Access this ACER Opinion here.         ACER opinion on the consistency of the Union-wide and the national network development plans      ACER has also published an Opinion on electricity projects in the national network development plans (NDPs) and their consistency with the project clusters in the TYNDP 2016.        The Agency notes that 33% of the national parts of the TYNDP 2016 clusters are not included in the respective NDPs, while an additional 4% are included only partially. Further, the Agency identified a few projects which are deemed by the relevant NRA as having cross-border relevance, but do not appear in the TYNDP 2016. This mismatch between the plans has significantly increased compared to previous years. The most frequent reason for this mismatch is that the commissioning date of the cluster or part of it is beyond the time horizon of the NDP, followed by reasons of non-sufficient advancement and lack of confirmation of the necessity of the project.           The Agency raises concerns about the credibility and feasibility of many clusters included in the “future project” category (projects which are still “under consideration” and/or expected to be commissioned beyond more than 10 years). This category constitutes the vast majority (71%) of the absent national parts and corresponds to about 40% of TYNDP clusters and more than half of the TYNDP expected investment costs (78 billion Euro out of a total around 150 billion Euro).          In order to improve consistency between the NDPs and the TYNDP, the Agency recommends ENTSO-E to include all NDP projects with cross-border relevance in future TYNDPs as well as to define and apply a procedure for inclusion of additional candidate non-NDP projects. Those projects which are opposed by all relevant NRAs should not be part of the TYNDP. Finally, the Agency notes that NDPs should include studies, even if they may go beyond the time horizon of the NDP, while their necessity should be carefully assessed by the NRAs.     Access this ACER Opinion here​. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-calls-for-further-improvements-in-Union-wide-and-national-electricity-network-development-plans.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0154	2017-03-23	ACER publishes an overview of cross-border cost allocation decisions	 The Agency publishes today an updated overview of cross-border cost allocation (CBCA) decisions for electricity and gas infrastructure projects of common interest (PCIs). CBCA decisions are one of the regulatory tools provided by the trans-European energy infrastructure EU Regulation to facilitate the implementation of PCIs.   Apart from a few exceptions in 2014, NRAs and the Agency, based on project specific cost-benefit analysis (CBA) showing in general net positive impacts in the hosting countries, decided to allocate investment costs following the “territorial principle”, meaning that costs are borne by the country where the project is located. In some cases, NRAs allocated only part of the investment costs due to expected excessive increase in transmission tariffs, and relied on EU funds to fill the financing gap. In all the cases, including for projects located in one Member State only, the project promoter(s) expressed their intention to apply for EU grants. ​​​​ The Agency also notes a decreasing trend in the applications for CBCA over time with a more even distribution between the gas and electricity sectors in the past two years. Almost half of the CBCA decisions referred to PCIs belonging to the Baltic electricity and gas priority corridors. The Agency’s findings also confirmed the trend that the vast majority of the investment requests are for projects located in only one Member State.     The overview and main findings is available here .              	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-an-overview-of-cross-border-cost-allocation-decisions.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0155	2017-02-08	ACER finds progress in the voluntary regional cooperation towards the single EU gas market	 ACER publishes today the latest edition of its Gas Regional Initiative Status Review Report  informing on the voluntary progress made towards the regional gas markets’ integration. The Report brings to light accomplishments such as the approval of a coordinated mechanism to manage congestion between France, Portugal and Spain (South Region) and the completion of fact-finding surveys and studies in the South South-East Region.              Beyond the achievement in the field of Congestion Management Procedures, in 2016 the South Region took promising steps towards a coherent implementation of the Network Code for Gas Balancing. Moreover, National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and Transmission System Operators (TSOs) cooperated in revising the existing Interconnection Agreements at their virtual cross-border interconnection points, to ensure compliance with the Network Code for Interoperability and Data Exchange. Portugal and Spain took an important step towards regional market integration through the creation of the common trading platform MIBGAS.           In the South-South East Region, NRAs completed surveys on the functioning of the Virtual Trading Points and on the implementation state of the Third Energy Package provisions, and studies on gas quality and data transparency. The latter studies were promoted by the Energy Community and saw active participation of the Energy Community Contracting Parties. The ROHUAT project (developed jointly by Romania, Hungary and Austria), aimed at offering incremental capacity through the route from the Black Sea to the Austrian hub, has entered the open season design phase. The allocation of cross-border capacity between Greece and Bulgaria and the coordination of the balancing interim measures between the two countries have proceeded only slowly. The same can be observed about the project aimed at minimising the burden associated with wholesale trading licensing and the respective reporting obligations.           The new role taken by the Serbian NRA (AERS) as a co-chair of the South-South East Region, starting from January 2017, marked an important milestone in the cooperation between the Agency and the Energy Community.       Find out more here .               	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-finds-progress-in-the-voluntary-regional-cooperation-towards-the-single-EU-gas-market.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0158	2016-12-21	ACER reviews EU gas network developments	 The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) has recently published an Opinion on gas network developments. The Opinion reviews national gas network development plans (NDPs) and assesses their consistency with the EU Ten-Year Network Development Plan (EU TYNDP). The opinion also contains the results of the Agency’s monitoring of the implementation of the EU TYNDP and investments to create new interconnector capacity between EU Member States.                  The main findings and recommendations of the Opinion concern various aspects of the NDP and TYNDP methodologies, coordination, consultations, transparency (particularly regarding costs and benefits), as well as other issues which could lead to a more efficient and effective implementation of the NDPs and the EU TYNDP. The Agency notes that there is a need to strengthen the regulatory oversight of the NDP in the Member States in which this oversight has so far been limited.            The Opinion and its Annexes can be found here.            	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-reviews-EU-gas-network-developments.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0161	2016-11-21	ACER has published its monitoring report on the 2015 Inter-Transmission System Operator Compensation mechanism	  On 15 November the Agency released its Report to the European Commission on the implementation of the Inter-Transmission System Operator Compensation (ITC) mechanism in 2015. Pursuant to Commission Regulation (EU) No 838/2010 on laying down guidelines relating to the ITC mechanism, ACER annually reviews the implementation of the ITC mechanism established by ENTSO-E for the purpose of compensating TSOs for the costs incurred on national transmission systems due to hosting cross-border flows of electricity.   The Agency notes in its latest report that that losses component of the ITC Fund increased by 19% compared to 2014 up to €153 million, which was mainly triggered by a significant increase of the volume of losses incurred by transit. At the same time the weighted average value of losses used for the 2015 ITC mechanism decreased. The full report is available here. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-has-published-its-monitoring-report-on-the-2015-Inter-Transmission-System-Operator-Compensation-mechanism.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0162	2016-11-18	ACER decides on the electricity TSOs’ proposal for Capacity Calculation Regions	 ​Today ACER has issued a Decision on the electricity Transmission System Operators’ proposal for the determination of the Capacity Calculation Regions (CCRs Proposal) in accordance with Article 9(11) of EU Regulation 2015/1222 on Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management (CACM Regulation) and Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 713/2009 (the Agency’s Founding Regulation). In this context, ACER confirms also the TSOs’ proposal to create a new bidding zone border between Germany and Austria.  ACER’s call for a direct merger of the CWE and CEE regions rests on the strong interdependency between the two regions, which, according to point 3.1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009, can only be handled with a common congestion management procedure at the level of the two regions. ACER’s confirmation of the TSOs’  proposal to create a new bidding zone border between Germany and Austria is based on the finding that the German-Austrian interconnector can accommodate all physical flows resulting from international trade requested by market participants only at the expense of major structural congestions on the neighbouring borders, but also within Germany. Therefore, the German-Austrian interconnector is to be considered as usually and structurally congested, requiring the implementation of a capacity allocation method pursuant to points 1.2 and 1.4 of the Guidelines annexed to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009.    The implementation of a new bidding zone border between Germany and Austria should be implemented according to a calendar to be agreed upon by the relevant regulatory authorities and TSOs and at the latest by the time when implementation of flow-based capacity calculation takes places in the merged CWE-CEE capacity calculation region in accordance with the CACM Regulation.  The definition of bidding zone borders in this Decision is without prejudice to the outcome of the bidding zone review process under Articles 32 to 34 of the CACM Regulation and shall be reviewed if such a process results in a different bidding zone configuration.   Background Information   An Agency’s Decision was requested on 17 May 2016 by the Chair of the Energy Regulators’ Forum - i.e. the regulatory authorities’ platform to consult and cooperate for reaching a unanimous agreement on a TSOs’ proposal – after the regulatory authorities, despite their best endeavours, could not reach a unanimous decision on the TSOs’ CCRs Proposal.  As in its Market Monitoring Report 2015, in today’s Decision the Agency yet again points at unscheduled/loop flows as one of the main obstacles to market integration in the CEE region. The cross-border flows on the German-Austrian border are increasing and represent respectively 54.5% and 42.5% of all cross-border exchanges observed in the CWE and CEE regions in 2015, i.e. the highest volume, of cross-border exchanges observed in the CWE and CEE regions. A significant share (i.e. 58.8% on average) of these exchanges is being realised through the neighbouring CWE and CEE networks and therefore significantly impacts cross-border trade and system security in the whole region.

ACER_NEWS_0163	2016-11-14	ACER calls for limiting the discrimination between internal and cross-zonal electricity exchanges	 ACER publishes today a Recommendation on the common capacity calculation and redispatching and countertrading cost sharing methodologies. This Recommendation establishes a set of high-level principles that aim to ensure that cross-zonal exchanges are not unduly discriminated against internal exchanges. The existing methodologies are indeed based on the assumption that the network must be able to accommodate all flows resulting from internal electricity exchanges, whereas cross-zonal capacities are used as an adjustment variable such that the total flows arising from internal and cross-zonal electricity exchanges comply with operational security limits. As a consequence of this approach, requests for internal electricity exchanges get unlimited and prioritised access to the scarce network capacity, whereas the requests for cross-zonal electricity exchanges can access only that part of the scarce network capacity which is not already used by internal electricity exchanges. The Recommendation therefore proposes that, unless dully and transparently justified by reasons of overall market efficiency and operational security, cross-zonal capacities not be reduced anymore in order to solve congestions created by internal electricity exchanges and that the latter be addressed with proper reconfiguration of bidding zones in the mid-term, appropriate network investments in the long term and by applying remedial actions (e.g. countertrading or redispatching) until the mid-term and long term solutions can be implemented.  Until a proper bidding zone configuration is in place and/or the appropriate investments to reinforce the network are implemented, the Agency’s Recommendation may have an impact on how and to which degree TSOs apply redispatching and countertrading actions. Therefore, the Agency’s Recommendation also addresses the problem of sharing the costs of these actions. These costs should be shared according to the “polluter-pays” principle, where the internal exchanges causing congestions, which need to be relieved by redispatching or countertrading, should be considered as polluters.  Background Information In recent years significant reductions of cross-zonal capacities have been observed on several interconnections in Europe. The cause of these reductions has been identified as the ever-increasing congestions created by electricity exchanges inside bidding zones, which, in turn, reduce the capacity of the networks available for cross-zonal trade. The problem has been presented and analysed in the last few issues of the Agency’s Market Monitoring Report (see the latest electricity wholesale volume​ for details). This Recommendation is addressed to all TSOs and regulatory authorities, which have the task, respectively, to develop and approve the common capacity calculation and redispatching and countertrading methodologies pursuant to the Guideline on Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management. The Agency calls on these methodologies to be compliant with the principles established in the Agency’s Recommendation.

ACER_NEWS_0164	2016-11-09	Gas consumers finally start to benefit from lower wholesale energy prices	 Many EU energy consumers are finally beginning to reap the benefits of the single energy market in terms of lower prices. The average household gas bill decreased by 4.2% in 2015, compared to the previous year, according to the latest Market Monitoring Report​ presented today in Brussels by the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER). The downward trend of wholesale prices observed in many countries over the last few years is finally reflected in the energy bills of industrial customers and in the gas bills of domestic consumers, but not for electricity households.      ACER’s Director Alberto Pototschnig highlighted:  “In 2015, wholesale gas prices decreased across Europe, as a result of declining oil prices, increased gas-to-gas competition and a greater availability of LNG. Electricity wholesale prices also continued their declining trend in many countries and remained below 2008 levels. This trend is due, at least in part, to more renewables and an overcapacity in generation. Both for gas and electricity, a better utilisation of the networks, as well as greater competition, have played an important role”.     Why have electricity retail prices not fallen?     In half the EU Member States, the price residential consumers pay for electricity has not fallen. This is because of an increase in the level of non-contestable charges in the consumers’ energy bills (e.g. related to the funding of renewables support schemes and, in some cases, capacity remuneration mechanisms and other system services). Regulators consider that the continued increase of these non-energy related charges in consumers’ energy bills hinders consumers’ ability to take advantage of the greater choice and better prices that the energy sector liberalisation is expected to deliver.      Progress in customer protection and empowerment     The Report shows that the legal provisions for consumer protection and empowerments are generally well established in national legislation and in practice. On average, it takes around 14 working days to switch (electricity or gas) supplier which is within the 3-week maximum period mandated by EU energy laws, and around 5 weeks to receive the final bill after switching supplier. Regulators have set a more ambitious goal of switching within 24 hours by the year 2025 (see our Bridge to 2025 recommendations). In 2015, 17 countries have minimal functionalities for smart meters specified in law to ensure benefits to household consumers. 20 countries have reliable price comparison tools in electricity and 15 in gas.     Commenting on consumers’ experiences with the market, Lord Mogg, Chair of ACER’s Board of Regulators and CEER President, said:     “Consumers’ empowerment is essential if consumers are to benefit from the greater choice available in the market. Smart meters, if they are equipped with proper functionalities, are a key enabler of demand response which in turn provides much needed flexibility in energy systems. As regulators we will continue our work to remove barriers to retail markets, to unlock demand response and to ensure consumers have access to reliable comparison tools.”    Access the report here. ​    	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Gas-consumers-finally-start-to-benefit-from-lower-wholesale-energy-prices-.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0165	NULL	First ACER report on the implementation of the Balancing Network Code available online	 ​The Agency publishes today its first Report on the implementation of the Balancing Network Code (‘Code’). The Report describes the status of the implementation and application of the Code across the EU Member States. The Code is applicable since 1 October 2015.The Report’s main objective is to assess progress in the Code implementation and the effectiveness of the balancing regimes, based on the best information available to the Agency during the compilation of this Report.          Rules on gas balancing aim at facilitating gas trading across EU balancing zones and at contributing to the development of short markets, including market liquidity. Union-wide rules on balancing have the objective to create an appropriate environment for network users to manage their balance positions in the different balancing zones of the Union in an economically efficient and comparable way.           Main findings of the Report:            Certain legal interpretations of the Code do not take into account the intent of the Code and its main objective, which is to deliver functioning short term wholesale markets. The terminology of the Code is not used consistently across EU Member States, leading to varying interpretations and inconsistent national implementations. Implementation optionality and flexibility undermine the intent of the Code. While their intent was to reflect local constraints, the current options offered by the Code triggered inconsistent implementation and delays. The delays mainly apply to the countries opting for interim and/or transitory measures. Full implementation is not yet achieved and will require further effort across the EU. While the challenge is greater for countries that have not yet enabled short term markets, most countries show some degree of incompliance and/or inconsistent implementation.  The implementation frontrunners are the United Kingdom, France , Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Poland.  The Report found Bulgaria, Romania and Greece to be significantly behind. In these countries market facilitation shall be revised and put on track to create the conditions for a market based balancing.  Interim measures countries are advised to keep track annually of the deliverables that would results in a full implementation of the Code by 2019. These annual reviews in most cases suffer delays and are not on track. Member States where the national implementations were foreseen by 1 October 2016, will be closely reviewed in the next edition of the Report. Spain made a good progress within this group. Main recommendations:   Regulators and stakeholders in each country should regularly monitor progress. Communication must be improved between stakeholders and regulators within countries. Stakeholders and regulators must regularly assess the progress made in implementing the Code and reflect on local market development to deliver the best possible outcomes for these markets and ultimately for the consumers. NRAs have an important role to play in this process. They shall take responsibility when evaluating policy options against each other within the local market conditions to deliver the best possible outcomes for the network users and consumers. Formal compliance with the provisions of the Code is not necessarily the end of balancing regime development, given that the market environment will continuously evolve.          It is necessary to improve knowledge sharing and dialogue across the EU. Best practices in creating liquid short-term markets must be shared across the EU, possibly with the support of the Agency and ENTSOG. This dialogue shall also take account of the evolution of the growing local markets.          European Commission may consider taking enforcement actions in the coming years. The observed slow implementation of the Code will be reassessed in the next edition of the Report. Delays in the implementation of key features of the Code may justify enforcement or infringement processes initiated by the European Commission.          ​The Report can be found here.                  The Technical Annex can be found here​.      Links:        Balancing page on Network Code and code development            Early Implementation Reports          ACER-​ENTSOG Report on the early implementation of the Balancing Network Code (BAL NC) on 22 October 2014         Second ACER-ENTSOG Report on the status of the implementation of the Balancing Network Code​ on 5 November 2015         Background:       The current Report explores the effectiveness of the balancing regimes in achieving a market-based approach to balancing. It uses a detailed assessment methodology consistently applied to each national balancing regime. It provides conclusions and recommendations across the EU, for the policies considered and per country evaluated.           The ACER-ENTSOG 2014 Report on the early implementation of the Balancing Network and the Second ACER-ENTSOG 2015 Report on the status of the implementation of the Balancing Network Code assessed the legal implementation of the provisions in the Balancing Network Code (Regulation (EU) No 312/2014). These reports revealed that the implementation of the Code was progressing along multiple time schedules and along several options.           The Code was published in Commission Regulation (EU) No 312/2014 of 26 March 2014. It foresees three implementation timelines: 1 October 2015, 1 October 2016 and 16 April 2019.                                                                                                                                              	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/First-ACER-report-on-the-implementation-of-the-Balancing-Network-Code-available-online.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0166	2016-10-27	Implementation of Network Code on Capacity Allocation Mechanisms well on track, but not yet completed	" One year after the application date of the Network Code on Capacity Allocation Mechanisms (NC CAM), the Agency publishes today an Implementation Monitoring Report in which it presents the achievements as well as shortcomings and delays in the implementation process of the NC CAM. The Agency urges Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) to promptly implement all the remaining provisions of the EU legislation, giving priority to capacity bundling, virtual interconnection points and capacity maximisation. The NC CAM applies to European Interconnection Points (IPs) since 1 November 2015. The Agency is in charge of monitoring the implementation of the Network Codes and evaluating their effects. The first NC CAM report exhibits a total average implementation level of 82% of NC CAM provisions across the Member States. The implementation level is high on the core requirements such as the auctioning of standard capacity products via booking platforms (94%). Nevertheless, a full implementation was only achieved by Belgium and the UK, while a few Member States are lagging behind. Main findings: Bundled capacity offers via booking platforms and the single nomination procedure should be promptly implemented where this is not the case yet. This should enable network users to easily access and nominate cross-zonal capacities. The Agency supports the further development of Virtual Interconnection Points (VIPs) as another important measure to simplify the commercial layer of gas transport and capacity handling for network users. Therefore, the Agency urges TSOs to start or continue their analyses and subsequently realise all possible VIPs before 4.11.2018. The Agency observed some implementation issues on the maximization of capacity (offers) at a number of Interconnection Points (IPs), in particular regarding 	-    the application of a joint method to analyse and remove technical capacity mismatches of both sides of an IP, 	-    the dynamic recalculation of technical capacities at a frequency jointly agreed among TSOs at each IP, as well as 	-    the use of network user data, where users provided it, on their expected future flows in the capacity calculations. 	​A proper capacity maximisation should be a priority for the involved TSOs especially at potentially contractually congested IPs. A dynamic re-calculation of technical capacity at a higher frequency by TSOs could contribute to the maximization of the capacity offer. 	  ​​The NC CAM indicators calculated for 2014 and 2015 show limited effects so far. The Agency observed an increase in bundled capacity offers (still at a low level), a visible increase in total bookings for peak days and rather stable total physical flows. However, these initial observations are based on just two years of incomplete data. Trends can only be observed over a longer assessment period. Transport data availability and quality at ENTSOG’s Transparency Platform requires further improvements with the help of TSOs and NRAs. Focus and approach of the report: ACER’s first NC CAM Implementation Monitoring Report focuses on the formal implementation of each of the respective CAM provisions by gas TSOs and NRAs in 2015/16. It is based on surveys run among TSOs and NRAs from 10/2015 to 3/2016. Data provided in these surveys was updated by NRAs until mid-October 2016.     The Agency evaluated the implementation level for the following NC CAM chapters:   Allocation of Firm Capacity, Bundling of Cross-Border Capacity, Interruptible Capacity, Tariffs & Capacity Booking Platforms. The Agency also calculated certain monitoring indicators for 2014 and 2015 in order to start evaluating possible effects of the NC CAM application. The underlying data stems from publicly available sources, such as ENTSOG’s Transparency Platform and the Capacity Booking Platform PRISMA.        Links: NC CAM Implementation Monitoring Report Regulation (EU) No 984/2013 (NC CAM) ENTSOG’s CAM NC Implementation Monitoring Report 2015, 8 June 2016​ Background: The Network Code on Capacity Allocation Methods (NC CAM) entered into force in November 2013. It became applicable at Interconnection Points (IPs) of the EU gas transmission networks on 1 November 2015. The implementation of the NC CAM provisions facilitates gas transport and gas trading across the EU. The code promotes and defines harmonised capacity allocation mechanisms in the form of auction procedures and a small set of standardised bundled cross border capacity products at IPs between entry-exit zones. The code, taking account of general commercial and technical rules related to capacity allocation, also specifies how adjacent transmission system operators shall cooperate to facilitate the sale and usage of bundled capacity.                  "	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Implementation-of-Network-Code-on-Capacity-Allocation-Mechanisms-well-on-track,-but-not-yet-completed.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0167	2016-10-14	ACER and ENTSOG organise second joint workshop on Gas Balancing in Warsaw	 On 9 November (10.00-16.30), ACER and the European Network of Transport System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG) will organise their second joint workshop on the Gas Balancing Network code implementation. The event will be held in Warsaw at the premises of URE, the Polish National Regulatory Authority at Al. Jerozolimskie 181.   This year the full day workshop covers four thematic sessions: planning national implementation, information provision, daily imbalance charges and neutrality.  The workshop will provide an opportunity to discuss the implementation practices and how daily imbalance charges are moving to a locally based reference price. National regulators, transmission system operators and network users are encouraged to join the event. Speakers will include representatives from ACER, ENTSOG, EFET, national regulators and transmission system operators.  The aim of the workshop is to foster the knowledge sharing across the Member states and to support implementation and the development of best practices. It is highly recommended for countries facing implementation challenges.  To participate at the event please register here. Registration will finish by 5pm on 7 November 2016. The draft agenda for the workshop is available here. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-and-ENTSOG-organise-second-joint-workshop-on-Gas-Balancing-in-Warsaw.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0168	2016-10-10	ACER invites gas companies to participate in e-survey on barriers in gas wholesale markets in EU Member States	 ACER invites gas companies to participate in an e-survey with the aim of identifying barriers faced by market participants in the gas wholesale markets in the European Union Member States.  The Agency has commissioned Kantor Management Consultants to carry out a study on barriers in wholesale gas markets in the European Union. The study’s findings will be included in ACER’s Market Monitoring Report, which will also make recommendations for overcoming the identified barriers.  An important part of this study involves launching an e-survey addressed to market players involved in gas wholesale trading activities across the EU.  The e-survey is addressed to:    Companies carrying out trading activities in one or more gas markets of the European Union and/or Trading companies which have analysed the possibility to enter into other European gas markets or Customers procuring gas directly in the gas wholesale markets. The e-survey will be accessible during October 2016.  You are invited to contact esurvey_gas@kantor-group.eu to access the e-survey. ​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-invites-gas-companies-to-participate-in-e-survey-on-barriers-in-gas-wholesale-markets-in-EU-Member-States.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0169	2016-10-07	One year of successful data collection under REMIT	 The Agency completed on 7 October 2016 one full year of data collection under the EU Regulation on Wholesale Energy Integrity and Transparency (REMIT). On this occasion the Agency is publishing the REMIT Annual Report 2016 for the Agency’s REMIT activities during 2015, as well as a new edition of the REMIT Quarterly, with the most recent updates on REMIT-related matters. The Agency is currently receiving more than 1m records of transactions, including orders to trade, on average per day and more than 35m records per month. This considerably exceeds the prudent estimates made before data collection began. The Agency notes that a high number of transactions in all likelihood reflects liquid and competitive markets. However, it also poses an additional challenge to the Agency. The Agency now receives the information it needs in order to monitor the market efficiently. Using the reported data, the Agency can detect and deter market manipulation and trading based on inside information. In the longer run, this will enhance market integrity and transparency for the benefit of European energy consumers and citizens.    More: REMIT Annual Report REMIT Quarterly Issue 6 Press Release   	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/One-year-of-successful-data-collection-under-REMIT.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0170	2016-09-28	ACER Work Programme for 2017 is available online	 The Agency’s 2017 Programming Document, which includes the 2017 Work Programme was published today following its adoption last week by ACER’s Administrative Board. The document, which was approved by the Board of Regulators on 14 September, is now available online here.  The document is structured according the format of the Programming Document for EU Agencies. The Agency’s multiannual outlook for the 2016 – 2019 period has been updated, but remains fully consistent with the one published last year. The Agency is not able at present to foresee the potential additional tasks that it may be given in the coming years in the framework of the Energy Union.   The document focuses on the four main areas on which the Agency expects to concentrate its activities in 2017 and in the coming years: the (post-2014) completion of the Internal Energy Market, the infrastructure challenge, the monitoring of wholesale energy markets and the longer-term regulatory challenges such as the integration of renewables.   While in 2016 the implementation of the monitoring framework of the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) has been completed, monitoring of trading in EU wholesale energy markets on the basis of the reported trade and fundamental data remains one of the Agency’s main challenges. The Agency’s effectiveness in such a monitoring activity crucially depends on it being assigned the significant additional resources that it has been requesting since 2014, and which the Agency is again requesting for 2017.  The 2017 Work Programme was adopted in line with the estimate of expenditure approved by the Administrative Board in January 2016, with a supportive opinion by the Board of Regulators, and without prejudice to the annual budgetary procedure.  Access all the work programmes of the Agency here. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-Work-Programme-for-2017-is-available-online.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0171	2016-09-21	ACER urges TSOs and NRAs to complete the implementation of congestion management measures in gas	 Two years after the first ACER Implementation Monitoring Report on gas Congestion Management Procedures (CMP), the Agency publishes today an updated Report in which it presents numerous shortcomings and delays in the implementation process. The Agency urges Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) to implement all the remaining actions foreseen in the EU legislation as soon as possible.  The European Commission (EC) Guidelines on Congestion Management Procedures (CMPs) are binding since October 2013.  The Agency is in charge of monitoring the implementation of the CMP guidelines and the Network Codes.  The current update shows the most recent implementation status across the EU. Although improvements are visible since 2014, the full implementation was not achieved.     Main findings:  CMPs are fully implemented in most Member States except Bulgaria, Italy, Hungary, Portugal, Romania and Spain. Actual CMP application was limited in 2015, except at Dutch, German and Austrian interconnection points (IPs). A dynamic re-calculation of technical and additional capacity by all TSOs at a higher frequency would contribute to the maximization of the capacity offer. The capacity products’ range for the surrender mechanism has to be enlarged in some Member States to be in line with the legal obligations. The harmonisation and coordination of CMP applications could be further improved, building on positive practical experiences in terms of coordination, such as those of the South Gas Regional Initiative. Transport and CMP data quality and completeness at ENTSOG’s Transparency Platform requires further improvements with the help of TSOs and NRAs. Focus of the report  ACER’s CMP Implementation Monitoring Report focuses on the formal implementation of each of the respective CMP provisions by Gas Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) in 2015/16. The provisions include the following mechanisms to relieve contractual congestion at interconnection points:  Oversubscription and Buy-Back (OS & BB), Firm day-ahead Use-It-Or-Lose-It (FDA UIOLI), Long-Term Use-It-Or-Lose-It (LT UIOLI), and Capacity Surrender. The Agency also monitors and reports on the actual application of CMPs at European Interconnection Points, based on publicly available data of ENTSOG’s Transparency Platform. This data is also used to calculate certain indicators in order to evaluate the effects of the CMP application.     Links:  Access the latest Implementation Monitoring Report on Congestion Management Procedures (Update 2016) here​  Previous edition of the report CMP Guidelines    Background  The Guidelines on Congestion Management Procedures (CMPs) are applicable in the EU as of 1 October 2013. The CMP Guidelines require the implementation of the above-mentioned congestion management procedures and their application at congested interconnection points. They also set out additional transparency requirements for TSOs and ENTSOG (the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas), including the publication of CMP related data on ENTSOG’s Transparency Platform.     	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-urges-TSOs-and-NRAs-to-complete-the-implementation-of-congestion-management-measures-in-gas.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0172	2016-09-19	Wholesale gas prices continue to fall in the EU but electricity prices end their decreasing trend in some countries	 The downward trend of wholesale energy prices continued in most of the EU in 2015, according to the latest ACER/CEER Market Monitoring Report, whose wholesale volumes were published today. The results will be discussed with stakeholders in a workshop next week in Ljubljana, which given the interest raised, will be accessible remotely via adobe connect. Find out more about the workshop here. Gas prices decreased across Europe as a result of declining oil prices, a greater availability of gas and increased gas-to-gas competition. For the first time since 2008 average electricity prices increased in a few countries in 2015; however overall prices remained far below 2008 levels. In some countries this can be explained by a high share of renewable energy and overcapacity in generation. Find out more on the findings within ACER press release​.         	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Wholesale-gas-prices-continue-to-fall-in-the-EU-but-electricity-prices-end-their-decreasing-trend-in-some-countries.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0173	2016-08-17	ACER invites stakeholders to discuss Market Monitoring findings on wholesale electricity and gas markets	 ACER invites stakeholders to a workshop to discuss its findings, as part of the Market Monitoring Report, on the state of the EU wholesale electricity and gas markets in 2015. The workshop will take place on 21 September in Ljubljana. Contrary to previous years, this year the Agency will launch separate chapters of the Market Monitoring Report once they are ready. This allows for the earlier publication of the wholesale electricity and gas chapters. These chapters will be available on the Agency’s website by half September. The workshop will provide an opportunity for stakeholders to hear first-hand from the Agency about its key findings on both markets, and to discuss those findings.   You can register and access the draft agenda here.     	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-invites-stakeholders-to-discuss-Market-Monitoring-findings-on-wholesale-electricity-and-gas-markets.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0174	2016-08-09	ACER consults stakeholders on the “congestion indicators” for gas interconnection points	 ACER launches today a call for Evidence on the “congestion indicators” included in the European Commission Guidelines on Congestion Management Procedures. According to this piece of EU legislation, National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) shall require Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to apply the Firm Day-Ahead Use-It-Or-Loose-It mechanism (FDA UIOLI) at the interconnection points where ACER finds that gas capacity demand exceeded the offer. However, some stakeholders have expressed doubts on the appropriateness of the current “congestion indicators” to properly detect contractual congestion and on the FDA UIOLI to address such congestion. Thus, the Agency invites stakeholders to propose alternative or additional “congestion indicators” to be used by the Agency in its congestion analysis, and to comment on the FDA UIOLI.  There are currently four “congestion indicators” triggering the application of FDA UIOLI, linked to the over-demand of products with specific durations or to the non-offer of products.  Stakeholders can share their views via the Call for Evidence from 9 August to 15 September 2016. The Agency will assess all comments received and will take into consideration those proposing clear improvements to the current provisions. With its congestion analysis and the present survey, the Agency aims to promote the efficient use of infrastructures to the benefit of the European energy consumers.  Commission Guidelines on Congestion Management Procedures  You can access the public consultation here.  	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-consults-stakeholders-on-the-%E2%80%9Ccongestion-indicators%E2%80%9D-for-gas-interconnection-points.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0175	2016-07-06	ACER publishes its Position Paper on the regulatory oversight of (new) entities performing monopoly or near-monopoly functions at EU wide or regional level	 The regional approach is an important component of the Energy Union Strategy. The implementation of the Third Energy Package envisages the establishment of new entities performing (new) monopoly or near monopoly functions. Some of these entities/functions have a clear EU-wide coverage (e.g. MCO function operator), while others have a regional scope (e.g. RSCs in electricity; and capacity allocation platforms in gas) with a potential to grow into EU-wide entities. This Agency’s Position Paper outlines an approach for an effective regulatory oversight of entities performing monopoly or near-monopoly functions at EU-wide or regional level, taking the principle of proportionality and subsidiarity into account and based on the complementarity of regulatory action at national and EU level. The Agency proposes that the responsibility for the regulatory oversight of these entities is assigned to the Agency itself when they perform monopoly or near-monopoly functions at EU-wide level, or at regional level with a clear roadmap for EU-wide integration. National Regulatory Authorities cooperating at regional level should instead be responsible for the regulatory oversight of entities performing monopoly or near-monopoly functions at regional level. In this latter case, the Agency will monitor that such entities and their regulatory oversight remain in line with the Internal Energy Market principles. The exact form of such an oversight will have to be defined on the basis of an assessment of the specific functions that the entities perform, the way in which such functions are performed and the risks to the integration and well-functioning of the Internal Energy Market. The Position Paper is available here. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-its-Position-Paper-on-the-regulatory-oversight-of-(new)-entities-performing-monopoly-or-near-monopoly-functi.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0176	2016-07-05	ACER: limited progress in implementation of Projects of Common Interest	" ACER published today its second consolidated annual report on the progress of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) in electricity and gas. The report contains the results of the monitoring of the progress of the projects on the second EU list of PCIs adopted in November 2015, for the 12-month period from January 2015 to January 2016.   The main findings of the report are the following: Overall, progress in implementing the PCIs is limited. The vast majority of the PCIs are delayed compared to their original schedule. For about a quarter of the electricity and gas PCIs, no progress was reported during last year. Permit granting difficulties are cited as one of the main causes for such delays. 	  Most commissioning of the PCIs is expected to take place in the coming 7 years. However, for this to be realised, the pace of asset construction would need to be considerably higher than what it was in the past year, which seems highly unrealistic. Also, according to the project promoters, 82 billion euros should be invested for gas and electricity PCIs together between now and 2022. In comparison with historical investment levels, this seems unrealistically high. 	  Project promoters indicate a limited interest in regulatory incentives or public financial support. The Agency’s findings may serve as an input to the European Commission’s report (due in 2017) evaluating the implementation of the PCIs and the effectiveness of Regulation (EU) No 347/2013. The report can be found here. "	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-limited-progress-in-implementation-of-Projects-of-Common-Interest.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0177	2016-06-23	ACER publishes its Position Paper on improving the effectiveness of the European framework for energy infrastructure development	 The Third Package and the Energy Infrastructure Package (EIP) aim at facilitating the development of the European energy networks. The Agency believes that the EIP could and should play a stronger role in improving the efficiency of energy network development. This is vital for delivering the Energy Union strategy and the transition towards a more secure and sustainable energy system which will require major investments including in networks. The Agency and national regulatory authorities have been closely involved in the implementation of the EIP. Following the adoption of the second list of projects of common interest and, drawing from the experience gained in the last three years, this Position Paper outlines the current thinking of the Agency towards defining a more coherent and efficient architecture for infrastructure development in four key areas:   Providing a more comprehensive understanding of infrastructure needs;  Addressing these needs by enabling efficient network development; Providing reliable information and ensuring efficient monitoring; Enhancing coordination between decision makers on the financing framework. The Agency is of the view that the TYNDPs should transparently identify and describe infrastructure needs, independently of the possible projects which could address them. The identification of the needs in the TYNDPs should allow Regional Groups to discuss and agree on the “European priority infrastructure needs”, and on the countries interested in solving a given infrastructure need. By providing a solid platform for all developers to propose solutions on an equal basis, such a process would pave the way to a sound PCI selection, building on detailed and reliable information to be provided by project promoters, in particular to allow an adequate and timely assessment of the proposed projects by NRAs.    It should however be clearly acknowledged that in complex cases, selecting the most efficient project is far from straightforward, as a project can be dependent on future market and network developments or compete with other projects.  For these reasons, not all PCIs should necessarily be built.   For the projects progressing towards implementation, the various financing and funding options made available by the EIP should be used, where necessary, based on the particular characteristics of each given project, as supported by the results of a monetised CBA. A clearer definition of which instruments should be used for which purpose is therefore needed, to help avoid overlaps, optimise the use of public funds and network tariffs, and facilitate an increased coordination of decision-makers, while maintaining their respective roles and responsibilities.   Most of the proposals could be implemented under the current legislative framework, while some will need to be considered in the context of the envisaged EIP review.   The Position Paper is available here.      	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-its-Position-Paper-on-improving-the-effectiveness-of-the-European-framework-for-energy-infrastructure-develo.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0178	2016-06-16	ACER to have a key role in the new EU energy landscape	 During ACER’s 5th Annual Conference: ‘ACER, Past, Present and Future’ held today in Ljubljana, Jerzy Buzek, Chairman of the European Parliament’s Committee for Industry, Research and Energy stated in a video message that according to the European Parliament ACER should have a key regulatory role in system management at regional level”. The new market design proposal is to be presented by the Commission by the end of the year. “With growing responsibilities, new resources are needed and ACER can count with our support to have a full and active role for delivering a truly common internal energy market in the frame of the Energy Union”, Buzek added.   Representing the European Commission, Mr Christopher Jones, Deputy Director General for Energy, confirmed that the role of ACER will have to evolve. The Commission is considering, he said, “a role for ACER in overseeing emerging regional entities, working rules and principles, as well as coordinated decisions”.    ​The Conference overall aimed to define how the Agency can best contribute to the common goal of completing a well-functioning, competitive, sustainable and secure Internal Energy Market in the context of the Energy Union. ACER Director Alberto Pototsching highlighted how “the ambitious climate change objectives the EU has set itself mean we will have more and more renewables in our energy mix, and therefore we need a more flexible energy system to respond to a greater share of renewable-based generation”.    The first Session, moderated by Lord Mogg, Chairman of our Board of Regulators, focused on the rationale behind the establishment of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, as part of the new regulatory framework defined by the Third Energy Package. The second Session, moderated by Mr Razvan Nicolescu, Chairman of our Administrative Board from 2014 to 2016, analysed the performance and milestones of ACER in its first five years of existence. The third Session, moderated by Dr Romana Jordan, the current Chair of the Administrative Board, looked at what the future role of ACER should be for effectively contributing to delivering the Energy Union.    The opening addresses were delivered by ACER Director, Mr Alberto Pototschnig, Slovenian Minister for Infrastructure, Mr Peter Gašperšič and Mr Zoran Jankovič, Mayor of Ljubljana. The Ambassador of the Netherlands to Slovenia, H.E. Mr Bart Twaalfhoven, illustrated the energy priorities of the Netherlands EU Presidency. Other high-level speakers at the Conference included representatives of the Energy consumers’ associations and market participants.      	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-to-have-a-key-role-in-the-new-EU-energy-landscape.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0179	2016-06-02	Energy regulators should be independent and sufficiently staffed	 Through the ACER Board of Regulators, the national regulatory authorities and the Director have been working to enhance regulatory cooperation at the European level. The Agency and the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) have complementary duties and powers, and a shared responsibility to deliver a well-functioning internal energy market. Close cooperation is key to achieving this goal. Indeed, NRAs already commit the equivalent of roughly 200 full-time staff to supporting the work of the Agency and to cooperation within its structures. Nevertheless, following up on the commitment in the “Bridge to 2025” conclusions paper, a Summit of the Agency’s Board of Regulators and the Director was held in September 2015 to explore ways of enhancing regulatory cooperation and ensuring that collaborative practices within the Agency remain fit for meeting the challenges ahead. The main outcomes and deliverables emerging from the Summit are described, along with the context and background, in this Executive Summary. A key deliverable emerging from the Summit is an ACER Recommendation on ensuring the independence of the Agency and NRAs. Although the independence requirements in the Third Package are generally robust, the Recommendation proposes measures to the European Institutions for reinforcing the framework already provided to ensure that the Agency and NRAs have the powers, autonomy and resources to carry out their duties effectively – including cooperating at European level. The Recommendation drew, in part, on conclusions of the European Court of Auditors – in the Special Report (16/2015) ‘Improving the security of energy supply by developing the internal energy market: more efforts needed’ – that “NRAs should have sufficient resources available for their activities, including allowing them to participate fully in EU-level cooperation activities.” To support the Recommendation, the Agency gathered comparable data from NRAs on how many staff members they have overall and how many of these they commit to work within ACER. This internal stock taking of NRAs’ human resources highlighted that while NRAs of all sizes commit resources to cooperation through the Agency, insufficient resources puts regulatory independence at serious risk.

ACER_NEWS_0180	2016-06-01	Over 28 million data records received in a month – REMIT data reporting progressing well	 The second phase of data collection under the EU Regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT) started on Thursday 7 April, when the system was opened for the registration of over-the-counter wholesale energy contracts, transportations contracts and additional fundamental data. Since then the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) has received more than 28 million records of wholesale energy market transactions. The Agency, together with the National Regulatory Authorities from the 28 Member States, has been observing the progress of reporting parties in complying with their obligations. This second phase complements the first phase of data collection of wholesale energy market transactions, including orders to trade, executed at organised market places which started on 7 October 2015. In the meantime, the Agency has approved 100 Registered Reporting Mechanisms (RRMs) for the reporting of trade and fundamental data. For the second phase of data collection, 67 new reporting parties were registered as RRMs in addition to the 33 RRMs which were already registered for the 1st phase of data collection. The Agency urges entities with reporting obligations to undertake all necessary steps to be registered as Market Participants with the competent National Regulatory Authority and to select a registered RRM to fulfil their obligations. 5th issue of the REMIT Quarterly published Read more about the latest developments, including recent updates of the REMIT Reporting User Package in order to further facilitate reporting, in the 5th issue of the REMIT Quarterly covering the period Q1/2016 here.

ACER_NEWS_0181	2016-05-31	ACER finds still contractual congestion in European Gas Networks	 Contractual congestion, a situation where firm capacity demand exceeds the technical capacity, has been detected at 17% of the entry and exit sides at interconnection points (IPs) across the EU. The Agency’s Annual Congestion Report includes a list specifying at which interconnection points the so-called Firm Day-Ahead Use-It-Or-Lose-It (FDA UIOLI) mechanism will have to be applied as a congestion management procedure (CMP) from 1 July 2016. The report analyses data from ENTSOG’s Transparency Platform (TP) from 2015 to 2017, as well as 2015 auction data from the 3 capacity booking platforms (PRISMA, RBP, GSA). ACER’s main findings   How much congestion? Contractual congestion was identified at 41 IP sides, out of which 20 had already been found congested in the previous report. Congestion was mainly triggered by the non-offer of firm capacity products with a duration of at least one month; while in some cases it was triggered by the occurrence of auction premia. Where? Contractual congestion was found at some borders all across the EU, although in the North-West region congestion is mitigated by active secondary trading and CMP application resulting in firm day-ahead capacity offers. Is there progress? Congestion Management Procedures are increasingly applied at IPs in the EU. Together with the use of interruptible capacity and secondary capacity trading, contractual congestion was alleviated in some cases, as also confirmed by the latest auction results of March 2016. What comes next? At 19 congested individual IP sides (of the 247 IP sides within the scope of the CMP Guidelines), the FDA UIOLI is not yet implemented. National regulatory authorities should require the respective transmission system operators to implement and apply the FDA UIOLI at the respective IP sides by 1 July 2016.    ACER’s main recommendations Improve data reliability: Although progress on transparency and data availability on ENTSOG’s TP was made, TSOs and ENTSOG are requested to ensure that all data are fully available on the TP, reliable, checked and consistent (e.g. with PRISMA auction data). Refining congestion definition: ACER requests the Commission to consider clarifying and extending the scope of “contractual congestion”.

ACER_NEWS_0182	2016-05-11	ACER’s Annual Conference: A look into the future as the Agency turns five	 ACER’s Annual Conference 2016, “ACER: Past, Present and Future”, will take place on 16 June. The Conference will aim to define how the Agency can best contribute to the common goal of completing a well-functioning, competitive, sustainable and secure Internal Energy Market in the context of the Energy Union. The Conference, which will be opened by Slovenian national authorities and key EU representatives, will be structured in three sessions. The first session - “How ACER came about” - will focus on the rationale behind the establishment of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, as part of the new regulatory framework defined by the Third Energy Package. Which gaps was the Agency called to fill and what were the expectations on the role of the Agency in promoting the Internal Energy Market? In March 2016 the Agency turned five. The second session will thus focus on the Agency’s challenges and achievements in its first years of existence, as seen from the perspective of its stakeholders and institutional partners. Particular emphasis will be given to the key lessons learned in the course of these five years, which may help the Agency improve its functioning in the future. The third session will consider ACER’s role in the future, particularly in the framework of the Energy Union.  What should the priorities be for its action? In which areas, if any, should the Agency extend its activities and be given stronger powers? How could the Agency improve its functioning to respond to the challenges facing the energy sector in the years to come and to ensure that EU energy consumers fully reap the benefits of the Internal Energy Market?

ACER_NEWS_0184	2016-04-13	Second phase of REMIT data reporting has started as planned	 The second phase of data reporting under the EU Regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT) started on the 7 April as planned. This phase covers contracts concluded “Over-The-Counter”, standard and non-standard supply contracts and transportation contracts from market participants, as well as reportable fundamental data from Transmission System Operators, LNG System Operators and Storage System Operators. It complements the first phase of data reporting which started on 7 October 2015 with records of transactions in wholesale energy contracts, including orders to trade, admitted to trading at Organised Market Places and fundamental data from the ENTSOs’ central information transparency platforms. Data reporting during the first phase has exceeded all expectations, with more than 1 million data records submitted to the Agency daily since 7 October 2015. Through the system developed for this purpose (ACER’s REMIT Information System, ARIS), the Agency is collecting the data for assessing and monitoring wholesale energy markets in order to detect and prevent trading based on inside information and market manipulation. The National Regulatory Authorities from the 28 Member States and the Agency will observe progress on reporting to ensure that all entities with reporting obligations take adequate steps to comply with these obligations. Specific information about data reporting requirements can be found on the REMIT Portal and in the Agency’s REMIT Q&A and FAQ papers which are updated on a regular basis.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Second-phase-of-REMIT-data-reporting-has-started-as-planned.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0185	2016-03-07	One month ahead: ACER is ready for 2nd phase of REMIT data collection	 On 7 April 2016, the obligation for market participants to report wholesale energy supply contracts executed over-the-counter, transportation contracts and additional fundamental data under the EU Regulation on Wholesale Energy Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) enters into application. This 2nd phase of data collection will complement the Agency’s data collection of wholesale energy market transactions, including orders to trade, executed at organised market places and of fundamental data from the European Networks of Transmission System Operators for electricity and gas that began 7 October 2015. In parallel with its effort to register reporting parties as Registered Reporting Mechanisms (RRMs), the Agency has provided a comprehensive set of guidance on transaction and fundamental data reporting. In addition, the Agency will publish further REMIT Q&As and FAQs on transaction and fundamental data reporting as required. Market participants should therefore be well prepared for data reporting as of 7 April 2016.​ Alberto Pototschnig, Director of ACER, emphasised that “the second phase completes the reporting of trade and fundamental data to the Agency, thus giving us the full picture of trading in wholesale energy markets in the EU. With this information, the Agency will be able to monitor these markets more effectively, to promote their integrity and transparency”.   RRM registration for the 2nd phase of data collection   The Agency and National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) are well prepared for the final stage of data collection as of 7 April 2016. In parallel to the ongoing registration of market participants by NRAs, the Agency has already approved 45 RRMs. The Agency is managing numerous additional RRM applications, mostly from self-reporting market participants. In the light of the Agency’s limited resources, it will continue to prioritise the RRM applications from third-party RRMs and from Transmission System Operators, Storage System Operators and LNG System Operators. This means that the Agency will only perform the registration of self-reporting market participants on a best effort-basis. Given that the RRM registration process typically takes at least three months, the Agency expects those RRM applicants who are not yet in the final testing stage of the RRM registration process to rely on third-party RRMs. The Agency therefore strongly advises market participants to approach one of the registered third-party RRMs in order to fulfil their reporting obligation as of 7 April 2016. The Agency has recently published on the REMIT Portal a list of RRMs which also indicates the data types for which the RRMs were approved.   Guidance on transaction and fundamental data reporting as of 7 April 2016   On 16 February 2016, the Agency organised the 11th public workshop on REMIT implementation which was attended by 140 participants. The workshop focussed on transaction and fundamental data reporting for the 2nd phase of data collection under REMIT as of 7 April 2016. During the workshop, third-party RRMs providing services for 2nd phase reporting were invited to present themselves and given the opportunity to network with potential future clients. In the margins of the workshop, the Agency published another update of its Q&As on REMIT and FAQs on transaction reporting, along with four instructional videos on how to become registered as an RRM. In this way, the Agency is doing its utmost to assist stakeholders to fulfil their obligations under REMIT. The Agency will continue to provide further guidance through the publication of additional REMIT Q&As and FAQs on transaction and fundamental data reporting in the course of the month and beyond, as required.   Commitment to facilitate data reporting for the purpose of market monitoring   The Agency is fully focussed on data collection as of 7 April 2016 and has therefore dedicated its limited resources to provide guidance and support to market participants in order to facilitate their reporting. The Agency is constantly aiming to improve its interaction with stakeholders through public workshops, roundtable meetings, Q&As and FAQs. It has established a Central Service Desk for reporting parties. It also introduced contingency measures for RRMs, including for RRM applicants, at the testing stage of the RRM registration process, facing technical reporting issues. However, the Agency’s commitment to facilitate data reporting for reporting parties is constrained by the Agency’s limited resources.   More specifically, the Agency has decided to maintain all XML schemas for the 1st and 2nd phases of reporting, therefore the electronic formats for reporting remain unchanged. This will smoothen the process despite some stakeholders’ requests for changes. The current schemas resulted from public consultations with stakeholders in 2014. Any potential future revisions of the current XML schemas will hence not take place before spring 2017 and following a consultation with relevant stakeholders.   The preservation of the current schemas will ensure operational reliability and legal certainty for both the Agency and reporting parties during the start-up phase of transaction reporting under REMIT.   In addition, the Agency has postponed the start of the collection of inside information through web-feeds by 6 months to 1 January 2017. In the same way the possibility for market participants to make sample transaction data requests from ARIS in order to verify the completeness, accuracy and timeliness of data submission has been postponed by 9 months to 1 January 2017.   Background   The purpose of data collection is market monitoring. REMIT establishes a new, unprecedented, sector-specific market monitoring framework to detect and prevent market abuse in European wholesale energy markets, where energy should be traded according to the highest transparency and integrity standards. The full implementation of REMIT is vital to guarantee well-functioning markets to the benefits of European energy consumers. This is even more important now that the single market is being completed through rules directly applicable throughout the Union and other developments such as a single day-ahead market for electricity, which operates from the Iberian Peninsula to Scandinavia and a common platform for allocating cross-border gas capacity on a growing number of interconnection points.   Useful links: List of RRMs Q&A on REMIT and FAQs on REMIT Transaction and Fundamental Data Reporting Data reporting requirements 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/One-month-ahead-ACER-is-ready-for-2nd-phase-of-REMIT-data-collection.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0186	2016-02-15	Reducing the administrative burden for reporting about key energy infrastructure projects	 ​ACER publishes today a Memorandum of Understanding signed with the Competent Authorities in 25 Member States responsible for facilitating and coordinating the permit granting process for the development of key energy infrastructure projects in Europe. These projects of common interest (PCIs) are essential for completing the European internal energy market and for reaching the EU's energy policy objectives of affordable, secure and sustainable energy. The agreement will allow promoters of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) to do a single reporting on the progress of their projects of common interest (PCI) to both ACER and the relevant national Competent Authorities responsible for permitting. ACER will provide a single reporting window to reduce their administrative burden. Furthermore this Memorandum of Understanding enables the participating Competent Authorities to have access to the most up-to-date PCI information, and carry out their PCI monitoring tasks in an efficient, coordinated and consistent way. At the same time project promoters are safeguarded with regard to the confidentiality, integrity and protection of the information they provide. The agreement was signed by the competent authorities in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK.

ACER_NEWS_0189	2016-02-11	ACER and ENTSOG launch a joint platform to facilitate a smooth gas network code implementation	 ​A newly created web-based platform www.gasncfunc.eu launched today by ACER and ENTSOG will allow stakeholders to notify implementation and operational issues related to gas network codes already in force. A joint process between ACER and ENTSOG aims to develop commonly recommended guidance on how to address such issues. ACER Director Alberto Pototschnig said: “I am very pleased that, through this new tool, we are now able to offer network users and other relevant stakeholders the possibility to notify us of problems related to the implementation of the Network Codes and Guidelines. The Platform will also make the assessment of these notifications by the Agency and ENTSOG, in their respective ambits of responsibility, more efficient, so that we will be able to respond more rapidly and therefore to contribute better to achieving the EU single energy market”. The new “Joint Functionality Process for Gas Network Codes” has been set up jointly by ACER and ENTSOG with the support of the European Commission. With this new process, all relevant parties can notify issues through a web-based platform and be involved in finding solutions. The process covers all gas network codes already in force. Participation in the process will require online registration. Non-registered users will have access to the list of submitted issues with a short description. The functionality process and the web-based platform will initially be considered as a pilot project which will be evaluated by ACER and ENTSOG after sufficient experience has been obtained. The gas network codes and guidelines already in place are the ones related to Capacity Allocation Mechanisms (CAM), Congestion Management Procedures (CMP), Balancing (BAL) and Interoperability and Data Exchange Rules (INT). The joint “Gas Network Codes Functionality Platform” is available at www.gasncfunc.eu A webinar to explain the process and illustrate all necessary details on how to use the platform will be held on 17 February at 16.00 CET (You will be able to access the webinar here).	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-and-ENTSOG-launch-a-joint-platform-to-facilitate-a-smooth-gas-network-code-implementation.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0190	2016-02-09	ACER publishes a report with main voluntary achievements towards the single EU energy market	 ​ACER publishes today the latest edition of its Regional Initiatives Status Review Report updating on the progress made on voluntary regional and cross-regional market integration. The reports highlights important milestones such as the early implementation of the European Harmonised Allocation Rules (HAR) for the electricity market. The report also shows the progress made in the pilot projects in different gas areas such as implementation of the third package and Network Codes (NC) and market integration. Furthermore, the report describes the obstacles faced in 2015 and the challenges ahead with regard to the early implementation process of the Network Codes and Guidelines.  In the electricity field, the entry into force of the Capacity Calculation and Congestion Management Guideline (CACM GL) in August 2015 as well as the positive vote in Comitology on the Forward Capacity Allocation Guideline (FCA GL) in October 2015 have moved most projects from a voluntary to a mandatory process. In the gas field, regional initiative will remain focused on those areas where it can bring a relevant contribution to the achievement of the IEM. That will include completing the application of already mandatory rules that still lack full implementation such as NCs on Capacity Allocation and Balancing, as well as developments on market integration and infrastructure.

ACER_NEWS_0194	2016-01-11	ACER workshop on cross-border cost allocation to be held on 2 February 2016	 Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 introduced cross-border cost allocation (CBCA) as an improved regulatory tool to facilitate the implementation of projects of common interest (PCIs), taking into account the distribution of costs and benefits across borders. On 18 December the Agency issued its Recommendation No 05/2015 to help project promoters and National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) in future cross-border cost allocation procedures and to facilitate a consistent EU-wide approach for CBCA cases by sharing good practices. Recommendation 05/2015 is accompanied by a summary report of CBCA decisions taken till September 2015. In this context, on 2 February 2016 the Agency will hold a public workshop at its premises in Ljubljana. All interested stakeholders are invited to participate. On this occasion the Agency will present its new recommendation on CBCA, including its approach for the submission of an investment request and the principles that NRAs should consider when assessing an investment request, with a focus on practical aspects. The workshop will also provide an opportunity to discuss the current challenges of the CBCA process. The Workshop’s webpage and registration is available here. Deadline for registration is 26 January 2016. Stakeholders are also invited to submit questions regarding the Agency’s CBCA Recommendation by 26 January to cbca-workshop@acer.europa.eu  	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-holds-a-workshop-on-cross-border-cost-allocation-on-2-February-2016.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0195	2016-01-08	REMIT implementation enters final stage	 ​Data reporting under the EU Regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT) has exceeded all expectations, with more than 1 million data records submitted to the Agency daily since 7 October 2015. It has been challenging in 2015 for all those concerned – market participants, organised market places, Registered Reporting Mechanisms, the Agency and the National Regulatory Authorities alike. The issues that appeared during the first weeks of operations have been solved and the Agency’s REMIT Information System (ARIS) is collecting data in a stable manner ever since. The Agency is now preparing for the next stage of data collection as of 7 April 2016. At the same time, in late 2015, the first two breaches of REMIT, in Estonia and in Spain, were sanctioned by the competent National Regulatory Authorities. REMIT implementation has now entered its final stage. More: ACER Press release (PR-01-16)REMIT Quarterly	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/REMIT-implementation-enters-final-stage.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0196	2015-12-21	ACER adopted a new Recommendation on cross-border cost allocation (CBCA)	 ​On 18 December 2015, the Agency adopted a new Recommendation  regarding good practices for the treatment of the investment requests including cross border cost allocation (CBCA) requests for electricity and gas projects of common interest (PCI). This Recommendation aims to facilitate future CBCA processes and to provide guidelines to and share good practices with project promoters and NRAs. It replaces the Agency’s Recommendation No 07/2013  on CBCA. The new Recommendation is built upon the experience gained with the first investment requests for PCIs and addresses a number of challenges and open issues raised by NRAs and stakeholders, as briefly described in the Agency’s Summary report “Experience with Cross-Border Cost Allocation” of September 2015. The new Recommendation provides: a) project promoters with guidelines to better fulfil the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 when submitting an investment request; b) NRAs with the main principles to be followed when treating an investment request and deciding on the cost allocation across borders. Background: Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 aims to facilitate PCIs implementation by envisaging decisions by NRAs or by the Agency on the allocation of the costs of such projects across borders if project promoters submit an investment request including a request for CBCA. Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 specifies the legal requirements regarding the submission of investment requests, including a CBCA decision. The Agency has deemed essential to provide clarifications and details with regard to certain elements of the “CBCA procedure” and thus assist NRAs and promoters of PCIs in adopting a consistent and streamlined EU-wide approach to investment requests. The Agency’s first CBCA Recommendation,  adopted on 25 September 2013, referred to the investment requests submitted in the framework of the first Union list of electricity and gas PCIs. This first CBCA recommendation foresaw its revision and completion before the deadline for the submission of CBCA requests following the adoption of the second Union list of PCIs. New elements: The Agency’s first CBCA Recommendation has been revised in many parts, including the assessment of project maturity, information requirements of an investment request, as well as the main principles for cross-border compensation and cost allocation. The new Recommendation clarifies that CBCA decisions shall be final, while they may contain specific ex-ante mechanisms for adjustments. Moreover, the new Recommendation also provides guidance on: treatment of uncertainties, CBA calculations, TSO consultation process, submission of investment requests, reporting requirements, cross border payments and evaluation of impacts on network tariffs.  	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-adopted-a-new-Recommendation-on-cross-border-cost-allocation-(CBCA).aspx

ACER_NEWS_0198	2015-12-17	ACER Administrative Board endorses closer cooperation with FERC	 ​Today the Administrative Board of ACER, the governing body of the Agency, has endorsed an agreement for further cooperation with the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). This development builds on the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between ACER and FERC early this year to enhance consultation, relating to the monitoring of cross-border wholesale energy markets. The Chairman of the ACER Administrative Board, Mr Razvan Nicolescu welcomed “closer cooperation between FERC and ACER, which will include an exchange of staff, and increase the capabilities of both bodies to handle the challenges to ensure the well-functioning of our energy market”. ACER Director, Mr Alberto Pototschnig stressed “the importance for the Agency to be able to take advantage of the experience of FERC in monitoring trading in wholesale energy markets”. He also expressed his “gratitude to FERC Chairman, Mr Norman Bay for seconding FERC staff to support the Agency in the implementation of REMIT, the EU regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency”. The general aim of this collaboration is to share knowledge, experience and best practices, and to provide support to each other in the process of monitoring wholesale energy markets in the European Union and in the United States of America.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-Administrative-Board-endorses-closer-cooperation-with-FERC.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0199	2015-12-02	ACER publishes conclusions and next steps in electricity transmission tariff scoping	 ​ACER published today the conclusions of the electricity transmission tariff structures scoping activity, undertaken during 2015. This document also sets out further steps to be undertaken during 2016 onwards. The Agency’s considerations and anticipated way forward have been informed by consultancy findings and recommendations, consulted through stakeholder questionnaire and two public events, and in consultation with ENTSO-E and the European Commission. The document, a consultancy report and other supporting documents, including further background, can be accessed here. Transmission tariffs enable the transmission operators to recover the allowed revenues which are usually based on the efficient costs for operating the network, including an appropriate return on network investment. In addition, tariffs should also provide economic signals for the efficient operation and location of producers and consumers, where appropriate.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Electricity-transmission-tariff-scoping.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0200	2015-11-30	ACER Market Monitoring Report 2015 - Fall in wholesale energy prices still not reflected at retail level	 ​Wholesale energy prices continued to decrease in 2014. This fall had a positive impact on the prices paid by industrial consumers, but often not on the energy bills of residential customers. According to the latest Market Monitoring Report presented today by the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER), 2014, household electricity bills in the EU increased, on average, by 2.6% with respect to the previous year, and gas bills by 2.1%. Alberto Pototschnig, ACER Director, highlighted that “whilst half of the household bill is non-contestable, the other half of the bill is open to competition. There needs to be competition both at wholesale and retail level to ensure that EU energy consumers reap the full benefits of market liberalisation. Market integration efforts should continue and be intensified. Social welfare losses for Europeans due to unscheduled electricity flows alone total about 1 billion euro every year”. The Report highlights the need to: fully implement the gas and electricity target models; integrate renewables into the energy system at least costs; and use cross-border network capacity in the most efficient manner. The Report confirms that day-ahead market coupling in electricity has enabled a more efficient use of capacity and helps price formation. It calls for coupling to be implemented on the remaining 12 (out of 40) borders within the EU. Also, national security of supply approaches should be coordinated, including through a European-wide adequacy assessment. For gas, the Report reveals there is an increasing price convergence among EU hubs as well as a narrowing gap between hub and long-term contract prices. Although gaps persist, recent infrastructure investments, in particular in reverse flow capabilities, are bearing fruit. Any benefits for final consumers? Although the lower wholesale prices did not result in lower retail prices in most countries, the Report shows that countries with longer experience of open markets generally offered more choice (including price preservation periods, dual-fuel offers or specific renewable features)  to consumers who were in turn more active. Retail market concentration, however, remained high in general and higher in gas than in electricity. Commenting on the consumer’s experience with energy markets, Lord Mogg, Chair of ACER’s Board of Regulators and CEER President, said: “More than half of all consumer complaints were related to prices, contracts and bills. Much more needs to be done to improve the functioning of retail markets and to gain the trust of customers to engage in our markets, including ensuring they get the information and services they need. Also, more than 80% of EU energy consumers remain with their original suppliers seven years after retail market liberalisation. Promoting well-functioning retail markets is therefore a core focus for regulators”. Which are the main barriers to competition? Despite the progress registered during 2014 towards completion of the Internal Energy Market, barriers to full market integration remain in most Member States, with the Baltic region and the South Eastern part of the EU facing the greatest challenges. According to the Report, in these regions the functioning of wholesale markets and transparency in price formation should be improved, while infrastructure should be further developed to support market integration.

ACER_NEWS_0201	2015-11-13	ACER and ENTSOG publish the Final CAM Roadmap	 ​ACER and ENTSOG published yesterday the last Capacity Allocation Mechanisms (CAM) Roadmap. This document primarily updates on the progress on pilot projects and gives a compliance analysis on the capacity booking platforms, but also reviews other CAM-related issues. Since 1 November 2015, the Network Code on Capacity Allocation Mechanisms (NC CAM) is applicable. National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and booking platforms had initiated an early implementation process of the CAM Roadmap to ensure timely compliance with the code. Among the findings of the report, TSOs are at the moment, incompliant with the code at six interconnection points, either because they did not decide to join any booking platform, or because they did not agree on auctioning bundled capacity at shared IPs on the same single platform. The report includes an analysis of the compliance of the booking platform operators, PRISMA, GSA and RBP with the NC CAM, using the results from a consultancy study. The actual evolution of the TSOs’ and booking platforms’ compliance will be analysed in subsequent implementation monitoring reports of ACER planned for 2016. The report also contains a section on CAM-related issues, which still represent interpretative and implementation challenge, like voluntary bundling of existing capacity contracts, harmonization of capacity contracts, capacity calculation and maximization as well as matching. The CAM Roadmap also presents pilot projects for the allocation of capacity according to the allocation mechanisms designed by NC CAM. These pilot projects were undertaken by TSOs and booking platform operators in 2015. Finally, the report updates the NC CAM IP Scope list, a full list of interconnection points to which NC CAM applies. You can access the Roadmap here.

ACER_NEWS_0202	2015-11-09	The 2nd ACER-ENTSOG joint Report on implementation of the Balancing Network Code is available online	 ​ACER publishes today the 2nd ACER-ENTSOG Report on the status of the implementation of the Balancing Network Code. The report monitors the early application of the Code across the EU Member States. Information for each country was provided by the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and the Transmission System Operators (TSOs) in a joint response to ACER and ENTSOG. Data are updated until the end of September 2015. The Balancing Network Code is applicable since 1 October 2015. The Code seeks to improve the economic efficiency of gas balancing by creating market places where network users trade imbalance positions and TSOs procure balancing services from network users in a non-discriminatory basis. The report can be found here.Access the network code here. Main findings: The implementation of the Code is progressing along multiple time schedules and along several regulatory options. Across the EU as a whole, almost all of the possibilities offered by the Code have been used by the responding countries.  Concerning the implementation dates: 10 countries implemented the Code by 1 October 2015; 5 countries reported that implementation will be ready by 1 October 2016; 9 countries and Northern Ireland apply interim measures, which are planned to expire by April 2019. These countries should make these plans transparent and also plan for how a timely transition moving away from the interim measures will be conducted. Additional findings: The information provision requirement is not put in place fully by one third of the countries, which would hinder network users to take care of their imbalance positions. In 14 countries and Northern Ireland, balancing services are still used or planned to be used and 13 countries foresee or allow the TSOs to trade in adjacent balancing zones. While both measures are subject to an annual regulatory review, a consideration should be made how these measures contribute to a market-based daily balancing regime, where TSOs procure balancing services from network users on a non-discriminatory basis. ACER considers that detailed analyses on the charges and merit order is required in the future to reveal whether the chosen balancing designs progress towards market-based daily balancing.    	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/The-2nd-ACER-ENTSOG-joint-Report-on-implementation-of-the-Balancing-Network-Codeis-available-online.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0204	2015-11-05	ACER publishes a report on the progress made on voluntary gas capacity bundling at interconnection points	 ​ACER has recently published a report on the progress made on voluntary bundling of existing gas capacity contracts at interconnection points (IPs). The report has been prepared by the Agency according to the Network Code on Capacity Allocation Mechanisms (NC CAM).   The main finding of the report is that voluntary bundling arrangements have not been reached by network users until 1 January 2015 (almost 14 months after entry into force of NC CAM).   However, several stakeholders (including EFET) expressed that they would like the TSOs to take on a more active role in facilitating bundling of existing capacity contracts.   The Agency’s report can be found here. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-a-report-on-the-progress-made-on-voluntary-gas-capacity-bundling-at-interconnection-points.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0205	2015-10-19	ACER publishes study on how best monitor the effects of the implementation of the network codes	 ACER releases today a study for a methodology proposal to evaluate the impact of the gas Network Codes and Guidelines in terms of implementation and market effects. ACER commissioned this study to the Cambridge Economic Policy Associates (CEPA). Main findings: A total of 45 indicators were selected for the desired effects of network codes/guidelines (NC/GLs) and policy goals, of which 23 network code/guidelines indicators and 22 market monitoring indicators.  The proposed indicators should not be used in isolation to draw conclusions regarding market impacts of network codes/guidelines, but rather be looked at in combination and interpreted in the light of market fundamentals. The indicators will be used by ACER in its annual MMR to measure the economic impact of NCs/GLs and its use will gradually increase over time. The implementation and compliance monitoring of the NCs/GLs will be addressed by ACER in separate reports. The final report and the presentation of the study are accessible below: CEPA study on Implementation monitoring and evaluation of the impact of the gas network codes and guidelines on the internal market Power point presentation of the study Public consultation process      	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-study-on-how-best-monitor-the-effects-of-the-implementation-of-the-network-codes.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0206	2015-10-16	ACER recommends amendments to the Gas Network Code on Capacity Allocation Mechanisms	 ​ACER published yesterday a Recommendation to the European Commission on the amendment to the Network Code on Capacity Allocation Mechanisms in gas transmission systems (NC CAM). The amendments to be adopted mostly relate to Incremental Capacity, but also to other technical details of the code. The amendment proposal provides a new regulatory framework to: Define incremental capacity, Assess the market demand for it, and Offer and allocate it in a transparent and market-based manner. The amendment proposal also covers small adjustments of the auction methods, changes to the default auction calendar and other clarifications of certain provisions. The Agency’s recommendation and its annexed amended NC CAM can be found here. From 17 July to 31 August 2015, the Agency held its second public consultation on possible amendments to the NC CAM related to Incremental Capacity and other technical aspects.

ACER_NEWS_0207	2015-10-14	ACER publishes study on capacity booking platforms assessment	 ​ACER releases today the study “Capacity Booking Platforms Assessment” which analyses the current gas capacity booking platforms’ compliance with the Network Code on Capacity Allocation Mechanisms (NC CAM), which is to be applied by 1 November 2015. The report compares the degree of network code implementation related to booking platforms as well as the functionalities provided by the three existing platforms. The study was co-financed by the three booking platform operators and a number of EU National Regulatory Authorities, who commonly selected an independent consultant to assess the platforms. As of 19 August 2015, both the Gaz-System auctions platform (GSA) and the Regional Booking Platform (RBP) complied with seven out of twelve legal requirements of the NC CAM, while the PRISMA platform was compliant with all but one. GSA and RBP met the majority of the associated requirements at either a basic level of compliance or as part of the platform’s implementation plans prior to 1 November 2015. PRISMA had a high overall level of compliance with all the associated requirements. Transmission System Operators (TSOs) on both sides of any interconnection point (IP) within the EU have to agree on which booking platform to use for each IP. Regulatory intervention may be required, if TSOs cannot agree. Considering the platforms’ implementation status outlined in the study, TSOs will need to manage the risk for possible national penalties imposed by national regulatory authorities, if a chosen platform is not fully meeting the NC CAM obligations by 1 November 2015.  The Capacity booking platforms assessment report is available here. Access the EU Regulation on the Network Code on Capacity Allocation Mechanisms here.

ACER_NEWS_0208	2015-10-08	ACER and CEER publish a joint response to the European Commission’s consultation on a new energy market design	 ​The joint ACER-CEER response to the European Commission’s Public Consultation on a new Energy Market Design is now available online. The response is structured in two parts. The first part outlines our vision on many aspects related to the future of the electricity sector in Europe. In the second part, this vision is applied to answering the specific questions posed by the European Commission in its Electricity Market Design Consultation document. European energy Regulators are committed to ensuring that the full benefits of market integration flow to consumers. We have consistently worked to promote competition in national, regional and European energy markets and to ensure that they remain attractive to investors. We consider that this consultation comes at an important time, when the energy market is facing new challenges and an appropriate policy and regulatory response is required. The feedback provided in the joint response is also based on the proposals included in the “Energy Regulation: a Bridge to 2025” Conclusion Paper of September 2014. They should be read in the context of the current ongoing implementation of the Third Energy Package, including Guidelines and Network Codes, as well as of REMIT. This implementation should be continued and prioritised and any improvement in the energy market design should be built on the existing provisions and the important results achieved in their implementation. A number of suggestions put forward in this document require legislative changes. Therefore, these suggestions are presented to the European Commission so that they can be considered for inclusion in future legislative proposals. You can access the full response here.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/CEER-and-ACER-publish-a-joint-response-to-the-European-Commission%E2%80%99s-consultation-on-a-new-energy-market-design.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0209	2015-10-07	ACER starts receiving data for the surveillance of the energy markets	 ​The requirement to report records of wholesale energy market transactions, including orders to trade, is part of the new monitoring framework established by REMIT to detect and deter market abuse in wholesale energy markets. This framework anticipates a shared responsibility between the Agency and National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs). The Agency will collect trade and fundamental data and will perform monitoring and an initial analysis and assessment of these data. Any detected suspicious instance will be notified to National Regulatory Authorities for investigation and, if necessary, enforcement. ACER Director, Alberto Pototschnig, said: “This is a very important milestone in the implementation of REMIT. It has been a formidable challenge for the Agency, as the monitoring framework we are putting in place is unprecedented in its scope and detail. In this respect, I would like to thank all stakeholders who have worked with us over the past years to make this possible, as well as my colleagues in the Agency who were able to overcome the serious lack of resources to deliver this landmark result. With the data that we are collecting from today, the Agency and national regulatory authorities, with whom these data will be shared, will have for the first time a full picture of trading in European wholesale energy markets, which can be used to detect, and thus deter, market manipulation and insider trading. In this way, market participants can be reassured that they all trade on the basis of the same information and consumers that the energy prices they pay reflect market fundamentals and are not distorted by market abusive behaviour”. Two phases for data reporting For the time being, only transactions in wholesale energy contracts admitted to trading at Organised Market Places and fundamental data from the ENTSOs’ central information transparency platforms need to be reported. The remaining wholesale energy contracts (Over the Counter (OTC) standard and non-standard supply contracts; transportation contracts) and reportable fundamental data from Transmission System Operators (TSOs), Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) System Operators (LSOs) and Storage System Operators (SSOs) will have to be reported from 7 April 2016. As of today, 31 third party reporting parties are registered and 8 additional third party RRMs are pre-registered in the system. NRAs from the 28 Member States and the Agency will observe the progress on reporting to ensure that all entities with reporting obligations take adequate steps to fulfil their obligations. Background ACER has been working steadily, with National Regulatory Authorities and energy stakeholders, on the implementation of REMIT, since before it entered into force in December 2011. In June 2014, the Agency opened the platform to support the Centralised European Register of Market Participants (CEREMP) to National Regulatory Authorities for the national registration of market participants. On 8 January 2015, the Agency’s new REMIT Portal went live and became a central point of entry to ARIS allowing the registration of Reporting Mechanisms (RRMs – Registered Reporting Mechanisms). The Portal also provide access to the “Notification Platform” through which anyone who has reasons to believe that market manipulation, including attempted market manipulation, or insider trading has occurred can bring it to the attention of the Agency. Also on 8 January 2015 the Agency provided a REMIT Reporting User Package to help reporting parties understand the REMIT transaction reporting regime and to provide them with sufficient guidance to make informed decisions about their transaction reporting obligations. Specific information about the data reporting requirements can be found on the REMIT Portal. These publications have been ever since accompanied by REMIT Q&A and FAQ papers on REMIT transaction reporting which are updated on a regular basis. Access the REMIT Portal here.

ACER_NEWS_0210	2015-10-05	ACER opens its system for REMIT reporting	 ​Acer opened the Agency’s REMIT Information System (ARIS) for submission of market data at 12 noon today, 5 October 2015, ahead of the entry into application, on 7 October 2015, of the reporting obligation for wholesale energy market transactions, including orders to trade, executed at organised market places. Registered Reporting Mechanisms (RRMs) can therefore already start to upload existing wholesale energy contracts. The first reports from RRMs have already been received. The data reporting obligation under EU Regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT) will apply from 7 October 2015 and reporting parties will have to provide records of wholesale energy market transactions, including orders to trade, executed at organised market places to the Agency. ACER will collect the data for assessing and monitoring wholesale energy markets in order to detect and prevent trading based on inside information and market manipulation.  The current deadline for data reporting under REMIT concerns market participants and third parties reporting on their behalf who will have to begin the reporting of transactions in wholesale energy contracts admitted to trading at Organised Market Places and fundamental data from the ENTSOs’ central information transparency platforms. The registration of Registered Reporting Mechanisms (RRMs) began already earlier in 2015. Currently 30 third party reporting parties for the first phase of reporting are registered and ready to start to report data to the Agency. Specific information about the data reporting requirements can be found on the REMIT Portal.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-opens-its-system-for-REMIT-reporting.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0211	2015-10-01	REMIT Quarterly and an update to the REMIT Reporting User Package published	 The third issue of ACER’s REMIT Quarterly has been published today on the REMIT Portal. In addition, several documents that are part of the REMIT Reporting User Package have been updated. The REMIT Quarterly provides detailed information on the changes to the REMIT Reporting User Package documents. A new version of the following documents has been published: the Manual of Procedures (MoP), List of Standard Contracts and List of Organised Market Places. In addition, a new edition of the Q&A on REMIT is now available. The Transaction Reporting Manual (TRUM) will also be published shortly. The publication of these documents aims to provide further clarity prior to data collection starting on 7 October 2015. All documents were published on the REMIT Portal.  	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/REMIT-Quarterly-and-an-update-to-the-REMIT-Reporting-User-Package-published.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0212	2015-10-01	ACER’s 2016 Work Programme available online	 ​ACER’s Work Programme for 2016, approved by the Board of Regulators and adopted by the Agency’s Administrative Board on 30 September, is now available online. The document is structured in line with the format of the Single Programming Document for EU Agencies. The Agency’s multiannual outlook for the 2015 – 2018 period has been updated but remains substantially unchanged compared to last year. It focuses on the four main areas on which the Agency expects to concentrate its activities: the (post-2014) completion of the IEM, the infrastructure challenge, the monitoring of wholesale energy markets and the longer-term regulatory challenges. The above areas will guide the Agency’s work also in 2016. In terms of complexity of the challenge ahead, the implementation of the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) deserves a special mention. In 2016 the implementation of REMIT’s monitoring framework will be completed. As of October 2015, the Agency will actively monitor trading in EU wholesale energy markets on the basis of the reported trade and fundamental data and using the purposely developed surveillance platform. This is a formidable task, both because it is unprecedented at the EU level and because the effectiveness with which the Agency will be able to perform this activity will crucially depend on it being assigned the significant additional resources that it has been requesting since 2014. The 2016 Work Programme was adopted in line with the estimate of expenditure approved by the Administrative Board in March 2015, with a supportive opinion by the Board of Regulators, and without prejudice to the annual budgetary procedure.

ACER_NEWS_0213	2015-09-24	Regulators’ Bridge to 2025 actions advance the Energy Union Strategy	 ​Today’s one-year anniversary for the “Bridge to 2025” Conclusions Paper is a testimony to the strong link between regulators’ “Bridge” actions and the Energy Union strategy, and our engagement in:         promoting liquid, competitive and integrated wholesale markets and a new deal for consumers; enhancing Europe’s security of supply; and moving to a low carbon society with more renewables and smart, flexible responsive energy. Regulators’ “Bridge to 2025” Conclusions Paper, launched in September 2014, recommends a set of actions for regulators, Member States, the European Commission and energy actors (including consumers). Delivering the Energy Union through dialogue and collective action One year on from the Bridge launch, regulators are already realising results focused on: strong stakeholder engagement to deliver the Energy Union strategy linking wholesale & retail markets in an integrated Internal Energy Market (IEM) new governance arrangements fit for an integrated market strengthening interactions with regulators within and outside the EU including through regulatory capacity-building along IEM principles Lord Mogg, Chairman of ACER’s Board of Regulators and President of CEER, underlined the importance of continuous stakeholder engagement and delivering tangible benefits to consumers: “Strong commitment and collective action by all energy actors, consumers and the Institutions is key to delivering the Energy Union strategy. Our forward-looking work on distribution networks and retail markets should help bridge the gap between wholesale and retail markets.” ACER ready to play a stronger role ACER Director, Alberto Pototschnig, stated: “Completion of the Internal Energy Market is at the core of the Energy Union Strategy. An integrated market, with an increased interaction between electricity and gas sectors, requires even greater cooperation among all actors and a fit for purpose governance and regulatory framework. ACER stands ready to play a greater role in a more robust regulatory oversight of the wholesale energy market, to reinforce regulatory cooperation and oversee the evolving role of network operators and other bodies. This requires firm commitments and action by all of us and effective monitoring.” Regulators, in close cooperation with stakeholders, are contributing to delivering the Energy Union through ACER’s work on (post-2014) Internal Energy Market completion, infrastructure development, wholesale market monitoring, Gas Target Model implementation and a review of the Electricity Target Model. Concrete examples of CEER’s work include an assessment of the new role distribution system operators (DSOs) will play in the future IEM, advice on data management, forward-thinking work across a number of areas including security of gas supply, gas storage, well-functioning retail markets and future renewables support schemes in Europe, and continuing efforts to better engage consumer bodies in the regulatory process.

ACER_NEWS_0214	2015-09-23	ACER calls for a coordinated capacity allocation procedure on the German-Austrian border	 ​Today ACER has issued an Opinion on the compliance of National Regulatory Authorities’ (NRAs) decisions approving the methods of allocation of cross-border transmission capacity in the Central-East Europe (CEE) region - which includes Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - with the 2009 Electricity Regulation and its Guidelines. In its Opinion, ACER invites the CEE NRAs and Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to commit, within the next four months, to the implementation of a coordinated capacity allocation procedure on the German-Austrian border, according a realistic but ambitious calendar with concrete steps. ACER’s call rests on an in-depth technical and legal assessment, concluding that the German-Austrian interconnector can accommodate all physical flows resulting from international trade requested by market participants only at the expense of major structural congestions on the German-Polish, German-Czech and the Czech-Austrian borders, but also within Germany. In that respect, the German-Austrian interconnector shall be considered as usually and structurally congested according to Article 2(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity, and therefore requires the implementation of a capacity allocation method pursuant to points 1.2 and 1.4 of the Guidelines annexed to that Regulation. The German and the Austrian NRAs and TSOs are also invited to evaluate whether the already implemented interim measures (e.g. the virtual phase shifter in place since February 2014) are sufficient to ensure network security, or whether additional interim measures coordinated at regional level would be necessary to ensure that the network is operated safely until a coordinated capacity allocation procedure on the German-Austrian border is implemented.  Background Information The Opinion was requested by Urząd Regulacji Energetyki (URE), the Polish NRA, on 2 December 2014. In the request URE highlighted the fact that the decisions of the Austrian, Hungarian, Slovakian and the Slovenian NRAs approve the methods of allocation of cross-border transmission capacity despite the failure of the methods themselves to provide for a capacity allocation procedure for the German-Austrian border. Specifically, the URE sought the Agency’s opinion on whether the absence of capacity allocation procedure on the German-Austrian border was in line with the relevant legislation. As in its Market Monitoring Report, in today’s Opinion the Agency yet again points at unscheduled/loop flows as one of the main obstacles to market integration in the CEE region. The cross-border flows on the German-Austrian border are increasing and represent 40%, i.e. the highest volume, of cross-border exchanges observed in the CEE region. Access the Opinion here.

ACER_NEWS_0215	2015-09-10	The Chairman of the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission presents at the EU Council their experience in market surveillance	 ​The Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) of the United States, Norman Bay, presented today to the Working Party on Energy of the Council of the European Union a first-hand account of FERC's experience in wholesale energy market monitoring. Mr Bay was joined by Vice-Chair of ACER’s Administrative Board, Piotr Woźniak, Chairman of ACER’s Board of Regulators, Lord John Mogg, and ACER Director, Alberto Pototschnig. In 2009 the EU adopted the Regulation on wholesale energy markets integrity and transparency (REMIT) which gave ACER the task of collecting information on wholesale energy transactions from market participants across the Union. As EU energy markets continue to integrate, the objective of REMIT is to ensure that prices are not unduly distorted to the detriment of consumers. Following the entry into force of the REMIT Implementing Acts in January 2015, the new monitoring framework with its reporting obligations will go live in October 2015. With the use of sophisticated software and expertise, ACER is to provide the first analysis of market transactions, which may lead to the identification of suspicious events. It will refer such cases to the competent National Regulatory Authorities who will investigate the matter further and, if required, impose sanctions. The experience of the United States In the US, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is responsible both for market surveillance and enforcement of sanctions. ACER has been working with FERC since before REMIT entered into force. Earlier this year, the Agency and FERC signed a Memorandum of Understanding on consultation, cooperation and the exchange of information related to the monitoring of wholesale energy markets. FERC’s experience shows the importance of strong market surveillance. In 2013, for example, FERC concluded several market abuse investigations, including two high-profile cases in which unjust profits amounting to around US$ 160 million were identified.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-FERC-Web-announcement.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0216	2015-09-08	ACER publishes the REMIT Annual Report one month before data collection starts on the occasion of its 10th Public Workshop on implementation	 On the occasion of the Agency’s 10th Public Workshop on REMIT implementation and one month ahead of the entering into application of the obligation for trade and fundamental data reporting on 7 October 2015 to report wholesale energy contracts executed at organised market places, ACER published today its annual report on its activities under the EU regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT) in 2014. The Agency presented the report during today’s Public Workshop in the context of the update on REMIT implementation and informed about the outcome of the public consultation on disclosure of inside information. Furthermore, the Agency gave an update on the registration of reporting mechanisms and provided a possibility for the currently 20 approved Registered Reporting Mechanisms (RRMs) to present themselves to stakeholders. A panel discussion on potential remaining open issues on transaction reporting as of 7 October 2015 was held with stakeholders and the way forward was elaborated. Highlights of the REMIT report  The Agency’s annual report for its REMIT activities in 2014 published today focuses on the Agency’s implementation and monitoring activities.  In 2014, the Agency continued with the development of the procedures and the IT platforms to support the collection and analysis of trade and fundamental data, as envisaged within the REMIT framework. In June 2014, the development of the Centralised European Register of Energy Market Participants (CEREMP) platform was completed and access provided to National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), including those which want to use a purposely-developed CEREMP module for handling the national registration process. With respect to the other parts of the Agency’s REMIT Information System (ARIS), a number of pilot projects, involving a large number of interested parties and focusing on data collection and data sharing, were run during the year. The Agency also published its REMIT Reporting User Package for preparing for the entry into force of the Implementing Acts on 7 January 2015, in order to provide market participants and other stakeholders essential information for the preparation of trade and fundamental data reporting as of October 2015. Thanks to the preparatory work done in 2014, ARIS became operational on 8 January 2015 with the REMIT Portal as a single access point to the ARIS applications and documentation. In addition, the Agency was able to start the registration of RRM applications in time in 2015. Despite the fact that the Agency’s main REMIT activities in 2014 were concentrated on the implementation of ARIS, it was at the same time already active in monitoring the trading activities at pan-European level, based on the limited information available, and its actions were complemented by NRAs’ monitoring activities at national or regional level. Furthermore, Persons Professionally Arranging Transactions were continuing with the identification and notification of potential breaches of the market abuse prohibitions as obliged under Article 15 of REMIT. The achievements in 2014 are particularly significant considering that the Agency has so far been assigned only a small part of the human resources required for the implementation of REMIT, and that the funds for the development of the Agency’s REMIT Information System were made available to the Agency only at the end of 2013. Since part of the additional resources, which the Agency would have required to deliver its Annual Work Programme, and envisaged in that estimate, did not become available to the Agency, the Work Programmes for 2014 and 2015 have been revised in March 2014 and in January 2015 and some activities planned, in particular with respect to the implementation of REMIT, were postponed. The REMIT Annual Report is available here.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-the-REMIT-Annual-Report-one-month-before-data-collection-starts-on-the-occasion-of-its-10th-Public-Workshop-.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0217	2015-07-24	ACER approves first third-party Registered Reporting Mechanisms and invites stakeholders to a workshop on REMIT implementation	 ​The Agency has today approved the first five third-party Registered Reporting Mechanisms (RRMs) under REMIT. RRMs can report records of transactions and orders to trade as well as fundamental data on behalf of a market participant directly to ACER. These can be organised market places, trade matching and trade reporting systems, including trade repositories, as well as the ENTSOs. The approved third-party RRMs have successfully passed all three RRM registration stages of identification, attestation and testing as stipulated in the RRM requirements.   A list of pre-registered third party RRMs for the first phase of reporting was already published in June for transparency reasons. That list will be updated as new third-party RRM applicants reach the final stages of their application process. There are currently 34 pre-registered RRM applicants listed. Additional third-party RRMs and more than 400 market participant RRMs are currently being processed in earlier registration phases.   Find the latest lists here.   The Agency also published today an updated XML schema (version 2) to report trades and orders to trade according to REMIT Table 1 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1348/2014. This was a result of fine-tuning the current schema version 1 to accommodate requests of organised market places. However, the Agency would like to stress that the publication of schema version 2 will not affect the use of the current schema (version 1) as any changes are minimal. This is why they will not have any impact on anyone who wants to use the current schema (version 1) for reporting as of 7 October 2015 since the new schema (version 2) will only extend the set of allowed values at the request of some reporting parties. Therefore the current schema (version 1) for the reporting of REMIT Table 1 will continue to be fully supported for the October go-live so that this fine-tuning will not have any impact on stakeholders’ ability to properly prepare for the go-live.   The schema is published as Annex V.I of the Manual of Procedures on transaction and fundamental data reporting here.   In the light of the REMIT reporting starting on 7 October, the Agency will organise a public workshop on REMIT implementation in Ljubljana on 8 September 2015. The following topics will be addressed and discussed during the workshop:   • Update on REMIT implementation and disclosure of inside information • Registration of third-party Registered Reporting Mechanisms (RRMs) • REMIT Transaction reporting as of 7 October 2015   The Agency will invite third-party RRMs approved by 31 August 2015 to present themselves during the public workshop and will discuss potential remaining open issues on REMIT transaction reporting as of 7 October 2015 with stakeholder representatives in a panel discussion.   Access the programme and the registration form here. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-approves-first-third-party-Registered-Reporting-Mechanisms-and-invites-stakeholders-to-a-workshop-on-REMIT-implementat.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0218	2015-07-24	ACER revises and recommends the Network Code on Electricity Balancing for adoption	 ​The Agency recommends to the European Commission to adopt the Network Code on Electricity Balancing and proposes significant amendments to the network code before the adoption. These amendments are needed to be able to meet the challenges related to the harmonisation and integration of electricity balancing market, but also to improve clarity and enforceability of this network code. The Agency notes the significant improvements of the network code done by ENTSO-E in its resubmitted version from 16 September 2014. Nevertheless, the Agency took a substantial effort to further improve the network code and balance its content with the regulatory perspective. With this respect, the Agency also welcomes the Commission’s intention to further scrutinize this network code following the consultation on the new energy market design, but nevertheless proposes the adoption of this network code as soon as possible as it is urgently needed to support the ongoing balancing market integration and related pilot projects.   The Agency’s recommendation includes two annexes, the first providing the justification for the Agency’s amendments and the second providing the amended network code. The recommendation, including annexes can be found here. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-revises-and-recommends-the-Network-Code-on-Electricity-Balancing-for-adoption.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0219	2015-07-15	Alberto Pototschnig reappointed to lead ACER until 2018	" The European Commission and the ACER Board of Regulators agreed and proposed this month that the achievements of the Agency and the upcoming duties and requirements called for an extension of the mandate of ACER Director, Alberto Pototschnig. The ACER Administrative Board then adopted the decision on 8th July to reappoint him for a term of three years starting as of 16 September 2015.   EU Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy, Miguel Angel Arias Cañete said: ""I congratulate Mr Pototschnig to his re-appointment as Director of ACER which will allow him to continue the very successful work he has done for the Agency over the last five years. The decision taken jointly by the Managing Board and the Commission comes at an important moment for the future of our energy markets and sends a strong signal that ACER, under the strong and able leadership of its current and future Director, will need to play an ever stronger role in creating a truly integrated market.""   The Chairman of the ACER Administrative Board, Razvan Nicolescu stated: “It has been an easy decision to take. In the last five years the Director has met very high standard of performance. I am happy he has accepted to continue this journey for three more years. ACER has already become a leading EU organisation in meeting stakeholders’ expectations. We all need to continue with the same commitment, professionalism and involvement”.   The Chairman of the ACER Board of Regulators, Lord Mogg remarked: ""All the NRAs join me in congratulating Alberto Pototschnig for the renewal of his contract. To have established the Agency so effectively and to have delivered such a respected and trusted body in so short a period is a remarkable achievement and we commit to further collaborative work on the next three years of his new term""."	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Alberto-Pototschnig-reappointed-to-lead-ACER-until-2018-.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0220	2015-07-15	ACER and CEER welcome the market-based solutions and cross-border focus of the European Commission’s energy market design	 ACER and CEER welcome the new energy market design consultation paper, launched today by the European Commission, and in particular the reinforced steer towards cross-border and market-based solutions. Lord Mogg, Chair of the ACER Board of Regulators and President of CEER said: “we are consistent advocates of competitive energy markets and we strongly support the Commission’s proposals. Integrating renewables into the market requires flexibility to be rewarded and demand-side response with far greater consumer response to be developed. The robust focus on market-based solutions supported by the right regulatory framework will allow well-functioning retail markets to grow”. Alberto Pototschnig, ACER Director, said: “The Commission’s energy market design consultation paper and regulators’ own developed thinking in our Bridge to 2025 proposals are well aligned. We have always supported consistent EU-level rules. We share the common aim of establishing liquid, competitive and integrated energy markets that work for consumers”.   Providing their initial reactions to the consultation launch, regulators underline:   - How important it is to enhance the functioning of electricity markets by bringing renewables (RES) into the market and linking wholesale and retail markets.   - We must move away from national interventions. We welcome the Commission’s ambition for a more harmonised EU approach to capacity markets and RES support schemes. To the benefit of European security of supply, ACER and CEER have long advocated an EU approach for measures on generation adequacy, network planning and capacity remuneration mechanisms.   - There must be greater participation in energy markets by facilitating a proportionate market-based approach to flexibility (an issue that CEER and ACER are jointly working on), including demand response, self-consumption, and emerging market innovation. The pivotal role of distribution networks in future interactive and flexible markets must be addressed.   - The importance of embedding robust and transparent governance to support an effective market, with clear roles and responsibilities for all energy actors.   - A fit-for-purpose market design must be developed to put consumers at the centre and which allows the regulatory framework and market rules to adapt to future developments.   Regulators will provide their complete response before the end of the Commission’s consultation. Moreover, in line with the commitments made (in September 2014) in our “Bridge to 2025” proposals, regulators are proactively working to deliver the cross-border trading rules necessary for a truly European wholesale market, and to develop a regulatory framework that supports a future-proof market design at both wholesale and retail levels (e.g. the newly published CEER paper on the future role of Distribution System Operators, a forthcoming paper on well-functioning retail energy markets and planned work on tariffs and incentives). 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-and-CEER-welcome-the-market-based-solutions-and-cross-border-focus-of-the-European-Commission%E2%80%99s-energy-market0715-6854.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0221	2015-10-08	ACER and CEER welcome the market-based solutions and cross-border focus of the European Commission’s energy market design	 ​The joint ACER-CEER response to the European Commission’s Public Consultation on a new Energy Market Design is now available online. The response is structured in two parts. The first part outlines our vision on many aspects related to the future of the electricity sector in Europe. In the second part, this vision is applied to answering the specific questions posed by the European Commission in its Electricity Market Design Consultation document. European energy Regulators are committed to ensuring that the full benefits of market integration flow to consumers. We have consistently worked to promote competition in national, regional and European energy markets and to ensure that they remain attractive to investors. We consider that this consultation comes at an important time, when the energy market is facing new challenges and an appropriate policy and regulatory response is required. The feedback provided in the joint response is also based on the proposals included in the “Energy Regulation: a Bridge to 2025” Conclusion Paper of September 2014. They should be read in the context of the current ongoing implementation of the Third Energy Package, including Guidelines and Network Codes, as well as of REMIT. This implementation should be continued and prioritised and any improvement in the energy market design should be built on the existing provisions and the important results achieved in their implementation. A number of suggestions put forward in this document require legislative changes. Therefore, these suggestions are presented to the European Commission so that they can be considered for inclusion in future legislative proposals. You can access the full response here. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-and-CEER-welcome-the-market-based-solutions-and-cross-border-focus-of-the-European-Commission%E2%80%99s-energy-market-design-.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0222	2015-07-09	The Role of ACER will be a Key Element for the Achievement of the Energy Union	 “The ultimate objective of the Energy Union is to bring affordable, secure, competitive and sustainable energy to all Europeans”, said EU Commission Vice-President for the Energy Union, Maroš Šefčovič, at the IV ACER Annual Conference, ‘An Energy Union for Consumers’, today at the Brdo Congress Centre near Kranj, Slovenia. In order to achieve that, Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy, Miguel Angel Arias Cañete, stressed three main elements: a new, modern market design; a new deal for consumers and the reinforcement of the role of ACER for further cooperation among National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and transmission system operators (TSOs).    In particular, Commissioner Arias Cañete said that the Commission plans to “reinforce ACER so it can carry out regulatory functions on the European level, oversee the gradual development of the internal energy market and deal with all cross-border issues”. “ACER could also be involved in the regulation and overview of both wholesale and retail markets as their convergence is inevitable within the next decade”, he added.   ACER and Final Consumers Although the work of ACER is very much linked to wholesale markets and the so-called horizontal networks, the ultimate goal of the Agency is benefitting the 500 million energy consumers in the EU. The ACER Director said that the “Agency is ready to contribute to citizens taking ownership of the energy transition by engaging Consumers organisations in the overall development of the regulatory framework”, and announced that “later this year ACER will be holding its first dedicated Consumers Hearing”, so the Agency can present what it does from the specific perspective of energy consumers and take their feedback on board.   Within ACER’s initiative to increase the engagement of final consumers with its work, the Agency also announced today that a significant part of the information regarding the Agency’s activities is now available within its website in the 24 official languages of the Union. Moreover, with the assistance of NRAs, ACER is expanding the multilingual footprint of ACER citizen’s summaries (short briefings describing how specific aspects of ACER’s work benefit EU energy consumers).   Over 200 participants attended ACER’s 4th Annual Conference. The opening address was delivered by the Slovenian Minister for Infrastructure, Mr Peter Gašperšič. Following his intervention, participants listened to the strong support of the European Parliament to the work of ACER through a video message from Jerzy Buzek, President of the ITRE Committee. Furthermore, the Luxemburgish Chargée d’Affaires a.i. to Slovenia, H.E. Patricia Pommerell, illustrated the energy priorities of the EU Presidency. Other high-level speakers at the Conference included representatives of the Energy consumers’ associations and market participants. The sessions were moderated by Lord Mogg, Chair of ACER Board of Regulators, ACER Director, Alberto Pototschnig, and Mr Razvan Nicolescu, Chair of the ACER Administrative Board.   Access the Conference image gallery here.

ACER_NEWS_0224	2015-06-29	ACER recommends the adoption of the Network Code on Emergency and Restoration	 ACER publishes today its opinion and recommendation on the Network Code on Emergency and Restoration. ACER acknowledges that the Network Code is in line with the Framework Guidelines on Electricity System Operation, and its objectives, and therefore it recommends its adoption by the European Commission. ACER still flags a few areas in which the Network Code could benefit from improvements, namely in the level of harmonisation of market interactions provisions, roles for regional security coordination bodies, treatment of Energy Storage, consistency and coherency with the interrelated Network Codes, national scrutiny and clarity in drafting of certain provisions in the Network Code and its Supporting Document. Since these improvements do not affect the compliance with the Framework Guidelines on Electricity System Operation, ACER advocates that they are addressed by the European Commission when adopting the Network Code.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-recommends-the-adoption-of-the-Network-Code-on-Emergency-and-Restoration.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0225	2015-06-29	The Agency calls on EU associations involved in the Electricity sector to express their interest to participate in the Market European Stakeholder Committee	 Today, the Agency, in close collaboration with ENTSO-E, launched a call for interest to all interested stakeholders to participate in the Market European Stakeholder Committee (the Market ESC).

ACER_NEWS_0226	2015-06-29	ACER publishes opinion on ENTSO-E’s latest winter outlook and summer review	 ACER has recently published its opinion on ENTSO-E’s winter outlook report 2014/15 and summer review 2014. According to the winter report, the forecast for Europe was to have sufficient generation for both normal and severe weather conditions in between 1 December 2014 and 19 April 2015. In case of severe weather conditions scenario, the report forecasted many countries would have been dependent on imports (Albania, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, FYRO Macedonia, Poland, Serbia and Sweden). Belgium was the only country to be expected to remain dependent on imports during the whole winter even in normal weather conditions. ACER acknowledges positively the enhancements ENTSO-E has made by using Pan-European Climatic Database to assess the renewable energy sources in-feed and including load-temperature relationship for regions which are found to experience adequacy risks. ACER urges ENTSO-E to continue implementing enhancements as described in the ENTSO-E “Seasonal Outlook Report Evolution”. ACER appreciates ENTSO-E’s investigation of potential threats to generation adequacy stemming from stress on natural gas supply, as requested by the European Commission. Although only 21 member states have provided their response, the analysis shows that only in few cases electricity generation is severely affected by disruption in Russian gas supply. On the summer review 2014, ENTSO-E provided a much more complete overview of the most important events that occurred during the summer in comparison to the forecasts and risks reported in the last Summer Outlook.  	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-opinion-on-ENTSO-E%E2%80%99s-latest-winter-outlook-and-summer-review-.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0227	2015-06-12	ACER launches a public consultation on the proposed methodology for monitoring the impact of the gas network codes on the internal market	 According to European legislation on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks, ACER has to monitor and analyse the implementation of the network codes and the Guidelines adopted by the European Commission. Today ACER launches a public consultation from 12 of June until 10 of July 2015 on the proposed methodology and invites EU stakeholders’ to share their views. The methodology has been developed by the Cambridge Economic Policy Associates (CEPA), which following an open procedure, was awarded a contract for consultancy services in the field of energy regulation. Comments proposing major improvements or pointing to factual mistakes will be taken into account and the Agency will request the CEPA to integrate those into their final study.You can access to the public consultation here. BackgroundThe European legislation on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks (Regulation (EC) No 715/2009) lays down rules for the Agency to monitor and analyse the implementation of the network codes and the Guidelines adopted by the Commission. Also, the Agency is responsible to assess the effect of codes in facilitating market integration, as well as on non-discrimination, effective competition and the efficient functioning of the market. The regulation also establishes that the Agency has to consult extensively with stakeholders in an open and transparent manner.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-launches-a-public-consultation-on-the-proposed-methodology-for-monitoring-the-impact-of-the-gas-network-codes-on-the-i.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0228	2015-06-03	ACER Publishes a List of Twenty-five Pre-registered Reporting Mechanisms (RRMs)	" Under the EU Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT) aiming to prevent market manipulation and trading based on inside information, market participants have to report their wholesale energy records of transactions, including orders to trade, directly to ACER. During the first phase of reporting details of wholesale energy products at organised market places to the Agency as of 7 October 2015, market participants shall report their records of transactions, including orders to trade, through the organised market places concerned, or through trade matching or trade reporting systems as reporting channels – the so-called third party Registered Reporting Mechanisms (RRMs). ACER has published today a list of pre-registered third party RRM applicants for the first phase of reporting, which are in the final registration stages.   Third-party RRMs are organised market places, trade matching and trade reporting systems, including trade repositories, as well as the ENTSOs for the reporting of fundamental data. The list contains all the third-party RRM applicants which have received an ACER code following the completion of initial administrative checks of their registration.   These prospective RRMs will be registered as soon as they submit the required documents and pass the subsequent technical IT testing stage using a web interface. After the testing, the applicants have to send a test report to the Agency.   The Agency is looking forward to receiving the documents and the first test reports from the applicants, which the Agency will process as soon as they arrive. The successful RRMs will then be approved and included in the list of RRMs, which will be published. While the submission of documents is taking longer than anticipated, the publishing of the list of RRM applicants, which have passed the first registration stages, provides transparency to European market participants on the most advanced RRM applicants, allowing them to prepare for entering into a data reporting agreement.   The Agency welcomes initiatives for standard data reporting agreements for European market participants with organised market places, especially if they are RRM neutral and comply with the requirements of competition law. The RRM applicants which have passed the first registration stages are only the spearhead of RRM applicants. 35 additional third-party RRMs and more than 250 market participant RRMs are currently being processed, the latter for the second phase of data reporting as of 7 April 2016.   Background The Agency’s Market Monitoring Department is performing a number of activities that are a key to the smooth implementation of REMIT, and the coming into force of the trade data reporting obligations from 7 October 2015. The Department supported National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) so that they were able to meet their deadline for starting the registration of market participants by 17 March 2015. In parallel, the Agency has continued the development of IT services for data collection, data sharing and market monitoring, and the initial assessment and coordination of activities on an increasing number of potential market abuse cases.   Even with the limited human resources currently available to the Agency, it has provided all third-party RRM applicants with support through webinars and telephone calls.  However, delays in the registration process have occurred, despite new arrangements being put in place to streamline some other procedures. In particular, a new procedure has been introduced to address the increasing number of stakeholder questions in monthly updates of the Agency's Q&A paper on REMIT, rather than replying to them individually.   Alberto Pototschnig, Director of ACER, said: ""Since REMIT came into force in 2011, the Agency has been asking, unsuccessfully, for additional staff commensurate to the challenge of implementing the new monitoring framework for effectively monitoring the EU wholesale energy markets. So far we have managed to progress in the implementation of REMIT despite our very limited resources, also thanks to a longer gestation of the REMIT Implementing Acts. But now, with the start of data reporting approaching, it is inevitable that the impact of the current resource shortage becomes visible, with some processes involving NRAs and other stakeholders being delayed. We are trying to minimise any disruption and we remain committed to our mission under REMIT to ensure greater transparency and integrity of the European wholesale energy markets in order to foster open and fair competition for the benefit of final energy consumers. We hope that we will soon be in a position to pursue this goal with adequate resources"".   Access the ACER press release here."	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-Publishes-a-List-of-Twenty-five-Pre-registered-Reporting-Mechanisms-(RRMs).aspx
ACER_NEWS_0229	2015-06-02	ACER and ENTSO-E step up efforts to ensure effective engagement of stakeholders in the Network Code implementation process	 ACER and ENTSO-E announced today that the feedback received from EU electricity stakeholders will soon be channelled through three specific committees, one per family of codes (Market Codes, Operational Codes and Connection Codes). The committees, chaired by the Agency, will engage interested parties. Relevant European associations, in particular, are envisaged to play an active role in the process. The initiative comes from the evaluation of the results of a public consultation launched by the Agency and ENTSO-E at the end of last year on how to ensure effective stakeholder participation in the forthcoming Network Code (NC) implementation process. ACER will publish a call in July for interested parties to join the Market Stakeholder Committee, which is expected to meet for the first time in September. In their draft Terms of Reference, both the Agency and ENTSO-E acknowledge the importance of the challenge for the European electricity sector to ensure implementation and compliance with the NCs across Europe, emphasising the importance of effective stakeholder engagement for the overall success of the NC implementation process. The European Stakeholder Committees (ESCs) shall in particular contribute to: monitoring the NC implementation process; achieving a more informed decision-making process for the methodologies and rules still to be developed. “ACER, ENTSO-E, Nominated Electricity Market Operators (NEMOs) and other parties responsible for the NC implementation are committed to collaborate in an open, transparent and timely manner within the new committees”, according to the terms of reference. The Agency and ENTSO-E are also ready to enhance stakeholder engagement both at regional and national level through their constituencies in the Member States.   Find out more in ACER Press Release. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-and-ENTSO-E-step-up-efforts-to-ensure-effective-engagement-of-stakeholders-in-the-Network-Code-implementation-process.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0230	2015-05-29	ACER finds still existing contractual congestion in European Gas Networks	 Contractual congestion, a situation where gas capacity demand exceeds the technical capacity, has been detected at about 15% of entry and exit sides at interconnection points (IPs) across the EU. The Agency’s annual congestion report​’s main outcome is reflected in a list specifying at which interconnection points the so-called Firm Day-Ahead Use-It-Or-Lose-It (FDA UIOLI) mechanism will have to be applied as a congestion management procedure (CMP) from July 2016 on, if congestion is still found in next year’s report. The report analyses transport, Congestion Management Procedures and capacity booking data from ENTSOG’s Transparency Platform (TP) for the period 2014 until 2016, as well as 2014 auction data from the PRISMA capacity booking platform.   ACER’s main findings •    How much congestion? Contractual congestion was identified at 32 IP sides and 4 bundles (i.e. a combination of exit and entry), for 13 of the IP sides for a second time. Congestion was mainly found by the non-offer of firm products with duration of at least one month, but also by the occurrence of auction premia.   •  Where? Most contractual congestion was found in the -South/South-East region, followed by the South region. In the North-West region the detected congestion is mitigated by active secondary trading and CMP application resulting in firm day-ahead capacity offers.   •    Is there progress? CMPs are increasingly applied at IPs in the European Union. Together with the use of interruptible capacity and secondary capacity trading, contractual congestion was alleviated in some cases.   •    What comes next? 24 congested individual IP sides (and 2 bundles) of the 257 IP sides assessed, have not yet implemented the FDA UIOLI and should potentially do so depending on the outcome of next year’s congestion report.   ACER’s main recommendations •    Improve data reliability: Although progress on transparency and data availability on ENTSOG’s TP - as far as relevant for the congestion report - has been made, TSOs and ENTSOG are requested to ensure that all data are fully available on the TP, reliable, checked and consistent (e.g. with PRISMA auction data).   • Refining congestion definition: ACER requests the Commission to consider clarifying the case of “congestion” when firm monthly capacity is not offered every month, since the current reading of the CMP Guidelines suggests that an IP is not considered congested if at least one single monthly product is offered.

ACER_NEWS_0234	NULL	ACER adopts a decision on the allocation of costs for the Lithuanian part of the Electricity Interconnection between Lithuania and Poland	 ACER’s decision on the allocation of costs for the Lithuanian part of the Electricity interconnection between Lithuania and Poland (LitPol link), published today, indicates that, although this interconnection provides benefits to several Member States beyond Lithuania, the latter, as a net beneficiary of the project, does not need financial compensations for the investment from the other Member States benefiting from the project under the Cross-Border Cost Allocation (CBCA) framework. LitPol is one of the Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) identified by the EU to strengthen the continent’s energy infrastructure. PCIs benefit from an improved regulatory regime, including the possibility for Project Promoters to submit a CBCA request.  ACER decides on the allocation of costs (CBCA decisions) for a given PCI when the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) of the concerned Member States are unable to reach an agreement within six months of the request.   On 28 November 2014, ACER was informed that no agreement had been reached on CBCA for the LitPol Link among the NRAs of Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland and Sweden, to which the Project Promoter, Litgrid AB, submitted an investment request, including a request for CBCA. ACER’s decision is based on a thorough review of the cost-benefit analysis and the identified impacts of the project (including on tariffs) provided by the Project Promoter, and on further information received from the Project Promoter and the NRAs and TSOs of the involved Member States in response to ACER requests and during ACER’s hearings. What is the project about? The LitPol Link connects the Lithuanian town of Alytus to the border with Poland (PCI 4.5.1) with 500 MW transfer capacity. Together with some related investments on the Polish side, LitPol aims at connecting the Lithuanian and Polish electricity systems, as well as the Baltic power system to Continental Europe, enabling energy transfer between these regions. By doing so, LitPol Link facilitates market integration and efficient market functioning, enhances energy security, and overall contributes to the stability and economic growth of Member States in the Baltic region.   Litgrid AB, the Project Promoter of the LitPol link, is the Transmission System Operator (TSO) of Lithuania. The company operates the Lithuanian electricity transmission network and is in charge of the transmission of electricity.

ACER_NEWS_0235	2015-04-23	ACER presents progress on common gas rules at the Madrid Forum	 In the frame of The Madrid Forum, which took place on 20 and 21 April, ACER reaffirmed its appreciation for the European Commission’s Energy Union communication as an opportunity to move EU energy policy into a higher gear to address common challenges. In this context ACER presented the progress made with regard to the Gas Target Model and supported cross-border cooperation under the regional initiatives. ACER actively took part in the debates on the network codes also addressed by the Forum.    ACER presented the recently published Gas Target Model - Review and Update, and provided an implementation plan, including the process for the calculation of the metrics for each wholesale market, and the self-evaluation process of the NRAs. Progress of the regional market integration pilot projects was also presented. Stakeholders welcomed the concrete examples, and discussed in particular the number of liquid hubs eventually needed in an integrated European gas market.    On Tariffs, ACER showed its commitment to continue the constructive dialogue with ENTSOG and the Commission. ACER is convinced that the cost allocation methodologies are at the heart of the Network Code. This topic should be tackled now and not be postponed to a later point in time. Improvements to the submitted Network Code, in line with ACER's Reasoned Opinion,  should be made in particular regarding limiting options in the outlined methodologies foreseen in the ENTSOG draft Network Code. Furthermore, ACER presented the preliminary results of this year's congestion report at the Madrid Forum planned to be published by 1 June 2015. Two examples of good cross-border cooperation were presented as case studies by the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) of the Netherlands and Austria (ACM and E-Control). ACER also called on NRAs and Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to prepare for implementation of the “firm day ahead use it or lose it” at those IPs identified as repeatedly congested in the ACER congestion report.   The implementation date for the Capacity Allocation (CAM) Network Code is fast approaching. The three existing booking platforms are urged to step up their efforts to implement a cooperation model by 1 November 2015. ACER will assess whether the chosen models are legally compliant and fully operational. ACER will furthermore conduct an analysis of the existing booking platforms to assess whether they all comply with the relevant provisions of the CAM Network Code.   The Madrid Forum was created by the European Commission to discuss issues regarding the creation of the internal gas market. Participants include ACER, NRAs, EU national governments, the Energy Community Secretariat, TSOs, gas suppliers, traders and producers, consumers, network users, and gas exchanges.   You can find the presentations of the Madrid Forum here. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-presents-progress-on-common-gas-rules-at-the-Madrid-Forum.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0238	2015-03-31	ACER invites ENTSOG to align further the Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff Structures with the Framework Guidelines	 ACER published yesterday its opinion assessing the Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff Structures for Gas. The opinion acknowledges the openness of the process carried out by ENTSOG as well as improvements in terms of structure and details. However ACER invites ENTSOG to amend the Network Code further to address misalignments with the Framework Guidelines. Subsequently to ENTSOG’s submission of a revised Network Code, the Agency will consider recommending it the European Commission. Progress achieved The Agency acknowledges the significant work undertaken by ENTSOG in developing the Network Code.  In particular, the Agency values the openness of the process led by ENTSOG that allowed contributions from the stakeholders and good cooperation with the Agency. In reviewing the Network Code the Agency recognises some improvements in the Network Code, compared to the Framework Guidelines, in terms of structure and details. However, on a significant number of substantive issues, the Agency has serious concerns about the content of the Network Code as submitted. Further improvements to be made The Agency’s main concerns regard the scope of the Network Code and in particular the definition of transmission services, publication requirements, the description of the various cost allocation methodologies, the approach to payable price, the conclusions of the impact assessment on the harmonisation of the tariff setting year, the pricing of interruptible capacity and non- physical backhaul capacity, and incremental capacity.

It is crucial to reinforce this cooperation and to enhance the complementarity of national and EU regulatory responsabilities. It is indeed a great honour to continue my chairmanship and to contribute to the Agency’s important work to deliver a truly integrated EU energy market”.   The next Board of Regulators will be held in Brussels on 6th May 2015. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Lord-Mogg-reappointed-as-Chairman-of-ACER-Board-of-Regulators.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0240	2015-03-19	ACER will not propose the Network Code amendment requested by Oil and Gas UK and Gas Forum to the Commission	 The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) will not propose to the European Commission the amendment request of Oil and Gas UK and Gas Forum. The two UK associations requested last year to amend the Network Codes on Capacity Allocation Mechanisms (‘CAM’) and Balancing (‘BAL’) to retain the current Gas Day in the UK. Following a public consultation on the matter, the Agency informed the parties about its position in a letter sent this week.    Oil and Gas UK and Gas Forum requested to retain the current UK Gas Day for the UK and Ireland by derogating Article 3(7) of the Network code on Capacity Allocation Mechanism.   Following a public consultation, the Agency looked at the merits of the proposal and found that it fell short, both for substantive and procedural reasons. On substance, the justification of the amendment did not: - Substantiate significant elements, while the burden of proof for the proposed derogation and its effects lies with the proposing parties. - Provide a credible cost-benefit analysis for the different scenarios and effects on the downstream market showing that the costs outweigh the benefits. - Model the claimed negative impacts on the liquidity of the UK national balancing point (NBP). - Provide all the information requested, in particular regarding production profiles.   In terms of process, the main reasons for not further considering the amendment are the following: - The network codes concerned (CAM and BAL) were prepared and discussed for a number of years with the full involvement of stakeholders, including upstream industry representatives. - The parties’ submission and the public consultation have not delivered new evidence, which could not have been included in the original NC development process. - An amendment proposal has considerable lead times. - The derogation could substantially delay the overall implementation of the NC CAM and BAL in the UK, as the implementation of the two network codes is linked and it is ongoing. Allowing amendments to go ahead without novel elements and strong market support could easily undermine the credibility of the Framework Guidelines and Network Codes development processes in general and set a negative precedent. Background information On 24 July 2014, the Agency received the joint submission of Oil & Gas UK and the Gas Forum for an amendment proposal to the Network Codes on Capacity Allocation Mechanisms (NC CAM) and Balancing (NC BAL). The proposed amendment would allow the UK and the Republic of Ireland to derogate from the obligation of adopting the common times of the Gas Day as defined by Article 3(7) of the NC CAM. From 19 January 2015 to 9 February 2015 the Agency publicly consulted on the UK Gas upstream industry proposal. A summary of the responses, as well as the responses themselves, are available here.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-will-not-propose-the-Network-Code-amendment-requested-by-Oil-and-Gas-UK-and-Gas-Forum-to-the-Commission.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0246	2015-02-10	ACER review of 2014 regional initiatives for energy market integration highlights coupling from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Barents Sea	 ​Important milestones such as the implementation of the European Price Coupling linking the electricity markets from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Barents Sea are highlighted in the last edition of the ACER Regional Initiatives report on progress made on regional and cross-regional market integration last year. The report also describes obstacles faced in 2014 and challenges ahead. ACER, which is in charge of coordinating this ‘bottom-up’ approach to market integration, has produced the report in line with its Annual Work Programme to assess the progress achieved with the specific project-approach in the electricity and gas fields. Being 2014 the deadline set the Council of the EU for the completion of the Internal Energy Market, this report observes the progress achieved as well as the difficulties in order to draw useful lessons for the coming implementation of the binding Network Codes. This move from the voluntary to the mandatory process will mark a new era in which the Agency and the National Regulatory Authorities have additional tools for achieving the Internal Energy market. Electricity: progress made and challenges for the sector -   The implementation of the European Price Coupling (EPC) reached several important milestones with first, the go-live of the North-West Europe Market Coupling on 4 February, quickly followed by the extension to the Iberian market on 13 May. On 19 November, the project for coupling the markets of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania with the EPC solution went live successfully. Early 2015, the EPC should cover the northern Italian borders. All remaining non coupled borders will have to follow quickly to comply with the Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management Guideline to come into force this summer. -     Early 2014, National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) sent a letter of comfort to the Cross-Border Intraday project parties to enable them to sign the Early Start Agreement with the selected service provider. Despite the European Commission’s involvement, the project progressed behind schedule. Due to the ongoing delays and increasing disappointment from stakeholders, the European Commission set the end of February 2015 as a deadline for the potential launch of alternative initiatives. -      Along with improvements at a local level, the creation of a wide allocation platform from the merger between the Central Auction Office and the Capacity Allocation Service Company and the drafting of a European set of rules for allocating long-term transmission rights progressed as planned. The ongoing process plans the submission of the European set of rules to NRAs by mid-2015 to enter into force for the 2016 auctions. -   The Central-West Europe project for the flow-based capacity calculation project was eventually postponed from November 2014 to March 2015 while encouraging progress was noted in the Central-East Europe region following the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding. -   All stakeholders support the selected cross-border balancing pilot projects as they enable experience to be gained and the requirements for a relevant target model o be further defined. However, transparency and project structure must be improved. Gas: status of the regional initiatives -    The GRI remains focused on the areas where it brings relevant achievements in terms of progress towards the Internal Energy Market (IEM): The Agency’s vision for the GRI is that it should continue to promote and facilitate the early implementation of the Network Codes (NCs), foster the integration of markets by monitoring and facilitating market integration projects and carry out other projects and activities at a national and regional level in line with the new regional Work Plans for 2015. -     The early implementation of NCs is more important than ever in view of the first Codes becoming binding in 2015: the GRI has been instrumental in identifying pilot projects at an early stage at a (sub)regional level and bringing together NRAs, TSOs and stakeholders to plan the steps needed to apply the NC provisions in the regions, thereby ensuring cross-border coordination. Work on the early implementation of the Capacity Allocation Mechanism (CAM) NC has continued in 2014, facilitated by the Agency and ENTSOG through the CAM Roadmap, and work has also started with regard to balancing. Early implementation work could also start on the forthcoming NC on Interoperability and Data Exchange and, once it is mature enough, on the NC on Tariffs. -     In 2014, the South and SSE gas regions started to plan the upcoming work for the next few years in their respective regions. The final Work Plan 2015–2016 for the South region was adopted on 3 November 2014 and the Work Plan 2015–2018 for the SSE region is expected to be adopted over the coming months. These Work Plans will become the new reference for regional work in 2015 and subsequent years. -    After an attempt to reshape the SSE region, NRAs are instead outlining new priority areas and activities in the new SSE Work Plan 2015–2018 and are introducing several changes to the organisational structure and working arrangements of the region. In October 2014, the Madrid Forum invited the European Commission and the Agency to ensure that a potential new geographical set-up of the gas regions, also including EnC Contracting Parties, guarantees the necessary cooperation and flexibility for the regions. In relation to cooperation with the EnC, the Agency took further steps in 2014 to strengthen this by having representatives from the EnC Secretariat participating in meetings of the GRI Coordination group and the GRI SSE region, and vice versa.

ACER_NEWS_0250	NULL	ACER publishes an Opinion on the implementation of the investments in gas network development plans	 The Agency  has recently adopted an opinion on the implementation of the investments in gas network development plans. The Opinion is the outcome of the monitoring of the implementation of the plans, which demonstrates that the development of a considerable number of investment items, especially pipelines and LNG terminals, appears not to be in line with the implementation schedule of the TYNDP 2013-2022. The Agency identifies potential non-alignment instances in the current TYNDP 2013-2022 and suggests to rectify them in the next TYNDP 2015-2024, rather than to amend the current TYNDP. The Agency finds that the main reasons for implementation delays are lack of market demand and postponement of related projects, such as gas power stations, CHP and LNG terminals. The Agency finds that information regarding the extent to which the projects are interdependent is very useful for investment implementation purposes. The monitoring also included the assessment of the alignment of investment items between different network development plans (ENTSOG TYNDP 2013-2022, national development plans, the 2013 PCI list, and gas regional investment plans). The Agency notes that the TYNDP 2013-2022 is aligned in about 60% of the cases with the other reference network development plans. One of the main reasons for misalignment of various network development plans is the postponement of projects; another reason is the different timing of the adoption of the plans.  The Agency’s Opinion also includes comments and guidance regarding the preparation of future TYNDPs and NDPs, and regarding other infrastructure related activities.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-an-Opinion-on-the-implementation-of-the-investments-in-gas-network-development-plans.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0251	2015-01-20	ACER issues an Opinion on ENTSO-E draft Scenario Outlook and Adequacy Forecast	 ACER has recently published an Opinion on the ENTSO-E's draft Scenario Outlook and Adequacy Forecast 2014-2030.  The Agency notes positively the fact that ENTSO-E, acknowledging the uncertainties involved in the long-term planning of the Ten Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP), adopted a scenario approach, including diverging assumption on various relevant parameters. In addition, the Agency acknowledges the value of the extensive engagement of the relevant stakeholders during the development process of the draft SOAF, through public workshops and call for inputs. However, the Agency deems that the whole methodology of constructing the necessary scenarios for the purposes of the TYNDP development process to be described in a comprehensive way and consulted with stakeholders. The Agency also deems that a review of the methodology by independent experts might contribute towards increasing the confidence on its results. In addition, the Agency sees room for improvement in the area of transparency of data values used and data sources. Further remarks by the Agency in its Opinion include: ENTSO-E could proceed in commenting and, where useful, implementing, suggestions by stakeholders included in the Long Term Network Development Stakeholder Group report   The TYNDP scenarios, while encompassing a wide range of the analysed parameters, should nonetheless be assessed for ‘feasibility’ related to factors such as system adequacy, economic viability of investments in generating capacity, flexibility embedded in the assumed system and dependence on gas. Further to the already proposed scenarios for TYNDP purposes, a scenario with high energy prices and high development of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is worth considering in the future Scenario Development reports, as high prices of conventional fuels are considered to be one of the main drivers for fostering RES deployment. The acknowledgement that ENTSO-E is in the process of re-designing the –currently deterministic- methodology for the adequacy assessment published in the SOAF reports. In this respect, the Agency expects ENTSO-E to present and consult on an integrated methodology, before applying it to the future SOAF reports. Furthermore, concerning adequacy, the Agency notes that the draft SOAF 2014: (a) contains assessment of adequacy up to 2025, while Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 requires adequacy assessment for a 5-15 years horizon from the date of the assessment and (b) does not include adequacy assessment based on market studies (a topic already present in SOAF 2012). Finally, the Agency suggests that ENTSO-E adopts a two-year period (instead of yearly, according to the current practice) for issuing separately the reports relevant to scenario development and adequacy assessment. Biennial edition of Scenario Development reports would reduce the effort compared to an annual publication and would allow more time to assess potential factors which may lead to different assumptions and estimations and updated methodologies between successive editions.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-issues-an-Opinion-on-ENTSO-E-draft-Scenario-Outlook-and-Adequacy-Forecast.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0252	2015-01-13	ACER publishes its first Implementation Monitoring Report on Gas Congestion Management Procedures (CMP)	 ​In the first implementation monitoring report of its kind, the Agency finds incomplete implementation and limited application of congestion management procedures across the EU.   Based on surveys among TSOs and NRAs, detailed analyses and case studies as well as an initial evaluation of the effects of CMP implementation, the first ACER Implementation Monitoring Report on Gas CMP delivers the following conclusions and recommendations:   CMP implementation is not yet fully completed in the EU and application of CMPs is rather limited. The dynamic re-calculation of technical and additional capacity by TSOs needs improvement in terms of higher frequency. Generally, the harmonisation of CMP application could be further improved. The currently largely mixed CMP application (OS & BB vs. FDA UIOLI) at the two sides of one IP and its possibly negative effects is to be further investigated. The capacity products’ range for the surrender mechanism has to be enlarged by some Member States to be in line with the legal obligations. The data reporting frequency to NRAs in respect to the LT UIOLI mechanism is to be increased to a biannual one. The NRAs are requested to better facilitate data reporting to the Agency and of their TSOs to ENTSOG’s Transparency Platform. The ACER Implementation Monitoring Report on Gas Congestion Management Procedures focuses on the formal implementation of each of the respective CMP provisions by Gas Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) in 2014. The provisions include the introduction and application of the following mechanisms to relieve contractual congestion at interconnection points:   Oversubscription and Buy-Back (OS & BB), Firm day-ahead Use-It-Or-Lose-It (FDA UIOLI), Long-Term Use-It-Or-Lose-It (LT UIOLI), and Capacity Surrender. The first Commission decision in the area of Guidelines and Network Codes in the gas sector was on the Guidelines on Congestion Management Procedures (CMPs), mostly applicable as of 1 October 2013 at Interconnection Points in the EU. The CMP guidelines put additional transparency requirements on TSOs and ENTSOG (the European Network of TSOs for Gas), including the publication of CMP related data on ENTSOG’s Transparency Platform.  	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-its-first-Implementation-Monitoring-Report-on-Gas-Congestion-Management-Procedures-(CMP).aspx

ACER_NEWS_0256	2014-12-17	ACER welcomes adoption of REMIT Implementing Acts	" ​The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) welcomes today’s adoption of the European Commission’s Implementing Acts on data collection under REMIT (the EU Regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency). The European Commission’s adoption follows the agreement reached in the REMIT Comitology Committee on 3 October 2014.The REMIT Implementing Acts will trigger real market monitoring at European level by ACER which is unprecedented. They will enable ACER to collect information in relation to wholesale energy market transactions and fundamentals, analyse this data and report suspicious events to the competent National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), which are responsible for investigating these matters further and, if required, imposing sanctions. Alberto Pototschnig, the Agency’s Director said: “Today the European Union has set the last cornerstone for the completion of the REMIT framework. It will enable the Agency’s data collection and market monitoring at pan-European level, to detect and deter market abuse in wholesale energy markets and along with the enforcement responsibilities of NRAs to safeguard market integrity to the benefit of consumers across Europe. We would like to thank the European Commission for their effort which made the adoption of this important implementing legislation still possible in 2014."" The adoption coincides with today’s 43rd ACER Board of Regulators meeting in Ljubljana. Lord Mogg, Chairman of the ACER Board of Regulators, which brings together representatives from all EU NRAs, stressed the importance of safeguarding consumers’ confidence in the energy markets and highlighted the need for sufficient funding of ACER to ensure the successful implementation of REMIT. “Market participants and energy consumers must be able to have full confidence on the integrity and transparency of European energy markets. It is absolutely critical that the Agency and National Regulatory Authorities have the skilled resources necessary to deliver on these expectations. Only in this way can we be sure that we will avoid the real risk of market abuse going undetected”, he said, in the margins of today’s meeting. The European Commission’s Implementing Acts define the details of reporting and namely:   draw up the list of reportable contracts and derivatives, lay down the details, timing and form of reporting and adopt uniform rules on the reporting of information to the Agency. The Implementing Acts require several Manuals to be developed by the Agency and issued upon entry into force of the Implementing Acts. ACER staff working document versions of these Manuals were already published on 9 December 2014 and presented during a public workshop on 10 December 2014. They will be finalised and adopted by the Agency upon entry into force of the REMIT Implementing Acts twenty days following their publication in the Official Journal. Next steps After publication of the Implementing Acts in the Official Journal of the European Union, expected in early 2015, and their entry into force twenty days thereafter, market participants and third parties reporting on their behalf will have: nine months to prepare for the reporting of reportable wholesale energy contracts admitted to trading at Organised Market Places and of fundamental data from the ENTSOs central information transparency platforms, and fifteen months to prepare for the reporting of the remaining reportable wholesale energy contracts (OTC standard and non-standard supply contracts; transportation contracts) and of reportable fundamental data from TSOs, LSOs and SSOs. Market participants have to register with National Regulatory Authorities prior to entering into transactions which are required to be reported under the Implementing Acts, i.e. within nine months of the Implementing Acts’ entry into force if they are entering into reportable wholesale energy contracts admitted to trading at Organised Market Places or within fifteen months of the Implementing Acts’ entry into force if they are only entering into other reportable wholesale energy contracts. Background REMIT establishes a new, unprecedented, sector-specific market monitoring framework to detect and prevent market abuse in European wholesale energy markets, where energy should be traded according to the highest transparency and integrity standards. The full implementation of REMIT is vital to guarantee well-functioning markets for the benefit of European energy consumers. It is even more important now that the single market is being completed through rules directly applicable throughout the Union and other developments such as a single day-ahead market for electricity, which operates from the Iberian Peninsula to Scandinavia and a common platform for allocating cross-border gas capacity on a growing number of interconnection points.  Despite the formidable challenge of applying this legislation, on which there is still little experience worldwide, ACER has been working steadily with National Regulatory Authorities and energy stakeholders on the implementation of REMIT, since it entered into force in December 2011. In June 2014, the Agency already opened the platform to support the Centralised European Register of Market Participants (CEREMP) to National Regulatory Authorities for the national registration of market participants. By using CEREMP, several National Regulatory Authorities were able to start the registration of market participants at national level well in advance of the deadline for establishing national registers of market participants (three months after the adoption of the REMIT Implementing Acts.) The development of the IT system for the collection and analysis of trade and fundamental data is also progressing well and will enable the Agency to register reporting parties upon entry into force of the Implementing Acts.

ACER_NEWS_0257	2014-12-12	ACER and ENTSO-E launch a public consultation to create Stakeholder Committees on Network Codes	 ​ACER organises a public consultation together with ENTSO-E on on the Role of stakeholders in the implementation of network codes and related guidelines, and in particular on the establishment of European Network Code Stakeholder Committees. Deadline for providing comments and responses to the consultation’s questions is 23 January 2015. Network codes were developed with a view to achieve Europe’s key energy policy goals of security of supply, competitive internal energy market (IEM) and decarbonisation. This is why network codes need to be implemented and complied with throughout the European Union. All market participants, Distribution System Operators (DSOs), Nominated Electricity Market Operators (NEMOs), Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and regulators will be involved. The implementation of network codes will be work intensive. Strong, continuous and effective stakeholder engagement is key for the successful implementation of network codes. This is why extensive consultation needs to be organised throughout the implementation phase. With the draft guideline on capacity allocation and congestion management (CACM), adopted by Member States in comitology on 5 December 2014, the European Commission tasked ACER, in close collaboration with ENTSO-E, to establish a stakeholder committee to facilitate discussion with stakeholders during the implementation phase of the different network codes.

ACER_NEWS_0259	2014-12-03	ACER’s 2015 Work Programme available online	 ​ACER’s Work Programme for 2015, approved by the Board of Regulators and adopted by the Agency’s Administrative Board on 1 December, is now available online. It focuses on the challenges ahead to ensure a well-functioning, competitive, secure, sustainable and transparent EU-wide energy market.The structure of the document has been aligned to the format of the Single Programming Document for EU Agencies. One of the major novelties is the introduction of a multiannual outlook for the 2015 – 2017 period. It focuses on the objectives in the four main areas on which the Agency expects to concentrate its activities: the (post-2014) completion of the IEM, the infrastructure challenge, the monitoring of wholesale energy markets and the longer-term regulatory challenges. The above areas, aimed at delivering tangible benefits to European energy consumers by ensuring more choice and better prices, will guide the Agency’s work also in 2015. The Agency’s greatest challenge will be the launching of the new, unprecedented and sector-specific energy market monitoring framework mandated by the Regulation on Wholesale Energy Markets Integrity and Transparency (REMIT). The 2015 Work Programme was adopted in line with the estimate of expenditure approved by the Administrative Board in March 2014, with a supportive opinion by the Board of Regulators, and without prejudice to the annual budgetary procedure.  	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER%E2%80%99s-2015-Work-Programme-available-online.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0262	2014-10-30	Road transport expected to lead the new uses of gas up to 2025	 ​The growth of new uses for gas up to 2025 in the EU will depend mostly on market aspects such as pricing, taxation, infrastructure availability and the commitment of the industry rather than regulation, according to the study Regulatory implications of new developments in the gas supply chain published today by ACER. The report –commissioned to Kantor consultancy- finds that the use of gas for road transport is expected to experience the highest growth as it represents a price competitive alternative that allows meeting stricter EU emission requirements.   The report assesses whether a series of new developments in the gas supply chain might create prospects for the increase of gas consumption in the EU. The study examined the market barriers and the regulatory arrangements which may affect their expansion. The study’s results and recommendations will provide input for the ACER’s updated Gas Target Model.   Land and water transport   The use of gas for road transport is identified as the development that will have a strong effect in the medium-term. The final gas tax regime in comparison to other fuels and the availability of infrastructure -filling stations- will be crucial for their expansion. Some regulatory aspects such as the access regime to LNG filling stations need to be carefully addressed as they will impact in the competition level.   The use of Liquefied Natural Gas for water transport is another promising potential option, which, however, will depend on the cost for retrofitting the vessels and on the availability of sufficient bunkering infrastructure to allow ships refueling. This last aspect is one where regulatory implications may play a role.   Other potential uses of gas   Production and storage of gas by non-conventional means (power-to-gas) is currently at a pilot development phase. Its major commercial deployment is expected for the medium-term, for absorbing curtailed renewable energy and acting as a balancing tool in the electricity market. The perceived main barriers for this new development are of technological and economic nature; nonetheless the regulatory framework for the insertion of either hydrogen or synthetic methane in the network, the rules for connecting to the electric system and more clarifications about the operational regime of the facilities should be clarified by regulators.   Deliveries of gas to final consumers with non-piped means could bring new market opportunities and enhance security of supply of remote areas. The licensing obligations and the rules for setting of a fair and competitive framework both among virtual suppliers and also between network and virtual supplies are the most important regulatory aspects to be addressed. Non-discriminatory schemes governing the access regimes to both loading (LNG case) and filling station facilities are considered key for enabling fair competition.  	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Road-transport-expected-to-lead-the-new-uses-of-gas-up-to-2025.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0263	2014-10-22	ACER Market Monitoring Report 2014 - Why is the decrease in wholesale energy prices not reflected in retail prices?	 ​Despite a general decrease in wholesale energy prices, gas and electricity retail prices continued to grow in 2013, although at a slower pace than in previous years. On average, the electricity bill for households increased by 4.4% while gas prices rose by 2.7%. The latest Market Monitoring Report presented today in Brussels by the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) identifies a vicious circle in many Member States wherein a lack of competition results in low switching rates, which is sometimes used to justify regulated tariffs which, in turn, can hamper competition.   In order to break that trend, Alberto Pototschnig ACER Director advocated “the removal of barriers to entry into retail markets by fully implementing the Third Energy Legislative Package, adopting the network codes and phasing out regulated prices for non-vulnerable customers as soon as possible”.   Wholesale market integration improving, but more flexibility required   At the wholesale level, both for gas and electricity, market integration continues to progress. In 2013, the efficiency level in the use of electricity interconnectors continued to increase, due to market coupling, reaching a level of 77%. However, this has not always resulted in an increase in price convergence. This is mainly due to the challenge posed by the penetration of renewables. Going forward, a larger share of variable and non-programmable renewable-based generation in the electricity system will require more flexible-response resources, including from demand response.   Regulators foresee a transition by 2025 to a low-carbon society, where flexible and responsive markets will change the way consumers engage with energy (and which will require enhanced regard for consumers’ protection and rights).  Pointing to the concrete actions outlined by regulators in the Bridge to 2025 proposals to better engage small consumers in the market, Lord Mogg, Chair of ACER’s Board of Regulators and CEER President highlighted “the need for an appropriate framework to include demand-response in the market”.   In the gas sector, the main challenge identified is the need to promote the liquidity of gas trading and ensure that all unused capacity, whether or not strategically acquired, can be easily returned to the market so that other shippers can use it if short-term trading opportunities arise.   What is hampering retail competition?   The lack of product and price differentiation provides few incentives for household consumers to switch supplier. This lack of switching and weak retail competition is often used to justify maintaining regulated prices, which in itself may hamper competition (especially if regulated prices are set below costs levels). But, there has been some progress. In 2013, the number of Member States with regulated prices has fallen, for example in electricity from 18 to 15, compared to the previous year. Also hampering retail competition is the fact that the energy component on which retailers can compete is relatively small.   Despite this effect, opportunities for consumers to get a better deal by switching are available, yet switching rates remain low in most Member States. The report notes that in some cases, it could be due to loyalty or risk aversion, but ACER and CEER also make a call for raising awareness of switching opportunities through, among other initiatives, the development of transparent and reliable online price comparison tools as well as transparent energy prices.   If you wish to find out more:   ACER Press Release ACER Citizens’ Summary ACER Market monitoring Report 2014  	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-Market-Monitoring-Report-2014---Why-is-the-decrease-in-wholesale-energy-prices-not-reflected-in-retail-prices.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0264	2014-10-17	ACER issued an Opinion on the ENTSO-E methodology for Incidents Classification Scale in 2014	 ​ACER has recently published its Opinion on the ENTSO-E Incidents Classification Scale – Methodology (ICSM) 2014. This is the first ACER Opinion on this ENTSO-E deliverable aiming at defining the scale for classifying system incidents according to severity, as well as, the scope and content of the ENTSO-E annual report on these incidents.   The Agency stresses in its opinion that the ICSM 2014 meets the objectives of non-discrimination, effective competition and the efficient and secure functioning of the internal market in electricity. The ICSM 2014 also effectively complements the draft Network Codes in monitoring how efficient and appropriate the network code provisions are, as well as the power system performance. As such the ICSM 2014 will support collecting factual and statistical data which the Agency will take into consideration when preparing proposals for amendments of the Network Codes.   Nonetheless, in a few specific areas, in particular concerning the granularity of the reporting and the involvement of the National Regulatory Authorities in the investigations of large-scale incidents, the ICSM 2014 does not appropriately take into account the Agency’s Recommendation on the Network Code on Operational Security of 11 November 2013.

ACER_NEWS_0265	2014-10-13	ACER welcomes the European Commission’s call for the full implementation of the Third Energy Package	 ​ACER welcomes the European Commission’s request for Member States to fully implement and apply the rules established by the Third Energy Package, as well as the electricity and gas network codes, included in its Report on the progress towards the Internal Energy Market published today. ACER welcomes the emphasis of the Commission’s report on the emergence of a robust single energy market thanks to the cooperative efforts at European level of national administrations, the energy regulators under the umbrella of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the network operators (ENTSOs).   ACER Director Alberto Pototschnig said “we are very glad that the Commission strongly supports the full implementation of the Third Energy Package and the implementation and strict application of its provisions, recognising also the key role played by the regional initiatives coordinated by the Agency in delivering the internal energy market and tangible benefits to European energy consumers as soon as possible”.   Market Integrity and Transparency   As the EC report indicates market oversight to ensure market integrity and to avoid market abuses has been tightened thanks to the application of the provisions laid down in the 2011 Regulation on Wholesale Energy Markets Integrity and Transparency (REMIT). The report also highlights that a central information transparency platform for the publication of data in electricity markets will also be established by ENTSO-E by early 2015.   ACER welcomes the emphasis of the Commission’s report on providing ACER and the National Energy Regulators (NRAs) with the necessary resources to carry out these significant new tasks effectively, in close cooperation with financial market supervisors and competition authorities, particularly as we are soon entering into the operational phase of REMIT with the adoption of the Implementing Acts. “It is of the utmost importance that regulators and ACER keep a close eye on the trading activities, because consumers and policy makers need to trust that prices are not manipulated to the advantage of some but detriment of consumers”, the report says.   Deepening the Internal Energy Market   As stated in its strategic Conclusions Paper “Bridge to 2025” ACER supports the Commission’s view that  the immediate priority should be on the full implementation of the core set of market rules to support the well-functioning of the internal energy market. As the Commission report states, this requires first and foremost the full cooperation of all the actors, within the Member States - by national  administrations and regulators - but also at European level - by the Commission, but also by ACER and the ENTSOs. “There are important challenges lying ahead for the energy sector, which require an appropriate regulatory response, as outlined in the “Bridge to 2025” Conclusions Paper. The full implementation of the IEM provisions represents one of the main pillars on which this Bridge will be built”, added Lord Mogg, Chairman of the ACER Board of Regulators.   You can also access ACER Press Release here.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-welcomes-the-European-Commission%E2%80%99s-call-for-the-full-implementation-of-the-Third-Energy-Package.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0266	2014-09-23	Regulators’ Bridge to 2025 energy proposals should guide the new Commission’s energy priorities	 ​Energy regulators today presented their “Bridge to 2025” Conclusions Paper to high level European Commission officials and stakeholders in Brussels. The regulators’ Bridge to 2025 recommendations are based on a holistic analysis of Europe’s energy sector and are particularly timely as the new Commission sets its EU energy priorities.   The “Bridge to 2025” Conclusions Paper, which is the result of extensive public consultation, identifies the trends foreseen in the ten-year period to 2025 and recommends a set of actions for regulators, Member States, the European Commission and energy actors (including consumers). Key amongst energy regulators’ cross-cutting proposals are:   to implement fully the Third Package framework; to establish a roadmap aimed at competitive and innovative retail markets by 2025; to promote flexible response, and its provision by generators and consumers on a non-discriminatory basis; to ensure that the market for new service providers is not foreclosed by incumbents; to develop the Gas Target Model to help manage the uncertainty about future gas demand; to promote security of supply through a greater consistency of assessment and policy mechanisms; to protect and empower consumers to participate actively in energy markets (principally through the development of the  CEER Consumer Vision); including establishing stakeholder panels of energy actors and consumer representative bodies; to review and, where needed, improve the arrangements for regulatory oversight of the European Networks of Transmission System Operators (ENTSOs) and of other bodies (e.g. nominated electricity market operators (NEMOs); and to further improve the efficiency of some aspects of the regulatory decision-making process at EU level, while maintaining those aspects which have proved to work effectively. ACER Director, Alberto Pototschnig, called for “determined action by the EU Institutions and stakeholders alike to fully implement EU legislation, including the network codes and the gas and electricity target models, to establish and maintain liquid, competitive and integrated wholesale energy markets and to deliver the tangible benefits which EU energy consumers deserve.”   Empowering consumers and integrating renewables   Lord Mogg, Chairman of ACER’s Board of Regulators and President of CEER, stated:   “As Europe moves towards a low carbon society with a greater penetration of renewable sources, our energy systems need to become more flexible and smarter. Our recommendations seek to ensure that such flexibility is provided in the most efficient way and that consumers, who can contribute to this effort, continue to be properly protected in a changing environment. We also seek to remove any barrier to new service providers entering the market to help consumers manage their energy demand more efficiently and engage in the market more effectively. This requires collective action by all energy actors.”   ACER’s “Bridge to 2025” includes proposals to develop markets that truly benefit consumers such as the development of toolboxes of good practices to empower consumers, to regulate distribution system operators, a roadmap to enable consumers to switch within 24 hours, advice facilitating the phasing out of regulated prices, and the development of an appropriate framework for the evolution of the market to include demand-side response. The regulators’ initiatives will be developed in the respective Work Programmes of ACER and CEER. Regulators will continue to work with all energy actors to meet future challenges.   Find out more in ACER press release.   Access other related documents here.    	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Regulators%E2%80%99-Bridge-to-2025-energy-proposals-should-guide-the-new-Commission%E2%80%99s-energy-priorities.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0268	2014-08-14	ACER issued an Opinion on the implementation of investments in electricity transmission networks	 ​ACER has recently published an Opinion on the implementation of investments in electricity transmission networks. This is the first ACER Opinion in this field and it focuses on the increase of cross-border grid transfer capability from each investment and on the timing aspect (status and timing/progress) of investment components.   ACER identified a planned increase of cross-border grid transfer capabilities for about 50000 MW. An increase of cross-border capabilities for about 2000 MW was provided by 8 investment items commissioned, including the Estlink II (Estonia-Finland), the interconnection Puebla de Guzman - Tavira (Spain-Portugal) the East-West interconnector (Great Britain - Ireland) and some network reinforcements. Considering investments across the European borders and national infrastructures, 76 investment components (out of 838 being monitored) were commissioned until May 2014. However, 108 investment components returned to an earlier planning status compared to the ENTSO-E Ten Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP) and Regional Investment Plans (REG) 2012.   Out of the TYNDP and REG investments, 44% are ‘on time’, 31% encounter delays (they cannot be delivered on time at the planned date), 21% are rescheduled (voluntarily postponed due to changes of the external driver) and 4% are expected ahead of schedule.   Regarding delayed investment components, ACER has found that 66% of them are delayed due to permitting issues, environmental reasons and re-routing, siting of substations and national law changes affecting permitting.   Regarding rescheduled investment components, ACER has found that 58% of them have been rescheduled due to changes on generation and demand side or changes in the overall planning data inputs. 18% of rescheduling is related to priority given to other transmission investments.   Finally, 32 investment components have been cancelled. ACER has found that 59% of them have been cancelled due to changes on the generation or demand side or in the overall planning inputs. The Opinion is available here.  	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-issued-an-Opinion-on-the-implementation-of-investments-in-electricity-transmission-networks.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0269	2014-08-11	ACER adopts a decision on the allocation of costs for the Gas Interconnection project between Poland and Lithuania	" ​Today ACER has adopted its first CBCA decision on a PCI, the Gas interconnection Poland Lithuania (GIPL). Preliminarily, the Agency concludes that the overall economic benefits delivered by GIPL to the involved countries are twice as high as its costs. However by country, Poland is a net cost bearer while Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are net benefiting countries. Therefore Poland will be compensated after the commissioning of the project with €85.8 million, of which €54.9 million will be paid by Lithuania, €29.4 million by Latvia and €1.5 million by Estonia. In order to expand Europe’s energy infrastructure to support the market integration and the penetration of renewable-based generation, the EU adopted last year a Regulation on guidelines for Trans-European Energy Infrastructure and identified a list of 248 key projects, the so-called Projects of Common Interest (PCIs). Among other tasks attributed to ACER in this domain, the Agency decides on Cross-Border Cost-Allocation (CBCA) for a given PCI when the National Energy Regulators (NRAs) in the concerned Member States are unable to reach an agreement.   ACER Director, Alberto Pototschnig, said: ""Today ACER adopts its first Cross-Border Cost-Allocation decision and by doing so, facilitates the implementation of a key project to connect the Baltic States to the Union wholesale gas market”. The ACER decision defines the cross-border allocation of the costs among the Member States concerned (Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) and the way in which the costs of the investments are reflected in the tariffs in these countries. It includes compensation payments to Poland, in pursuit of a fair distribution of the costs and benefits of the project within its area of impact. The contributions will help bridging the financial gap of the project, along with possible funding from other sources. In order to issue the decision, ACER reviewed the identified impacts of the project (including on network tariffs), the cost-benefit analysis, and the regional and Union-wide effects of the project, and the results of its consultation with the Project Promoters, the NRAs and Transmission System Operators in the concerned Member States.   The decision has been sent to the parties involved and a non-confidential version will be published here in due course, upon becoming available.   Find out more in ACER press release.  "	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-adopts-a-decision-on-the-allocation-of-costs-for-the-Gas-Interconnection-project-between-Poland-and-Lithuania.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0270	2014-07-22	ACER opens a public consultation on transaction reporting under REMIT	 ACER launched today a public consultation on ACER’s Transaction Reporting User Manual (TRUM) and the RRM requirements, for transaction reporting under REMIT. The Agency welcomes comments, in particular related to the issues listed in these consultation papers, by 2 September 2014 12.00 noon, Central European Time, to be sent to Remit.PublicConsultations@acer.europa.eu. In order to ensure transparency and full involvement of stakeholders, the Agency organised a public workshop in Ljubljana on 16 July 2014 to collect stakeholders’ views on the upcoming public consultation. A follow-up workshop will be organised in October 2014. The draft Implementing Acts presented by the Commission in July 2014 provided that the Agency shall explain the details of the reportable transaction information under REMIT in a user manual. On this basis, the Agency is currently preparing the TRUM. The draft Implementing Acts also provide that, in order to ensure efficient, effective and safe exchange and handling of information, the Agency shall, after consulting reporting parties, develop technical and organisational requirements for submitting data. For this purpose, the Agency is developing the RRM Requirements. The purpose of the public consultation paper is to collect views from all parties interested in the implementation of REMIT, including market participants, organised market places, etc. Please note that the two documents; the draft TRUM and the RRM Requirements, are based on the current version of the Commission’s draft Implementing Acts. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-opens-a-public-consultation-on-transaction-reporting-under-REMIT.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0271	2014-07-01	ACER recommendation on risk evaluation and incentives for PCIs	 ​ACER has published a Recommendation on incentives for projects of common interest and on a common methodology for risk evaluation.   ACER assessed national practices regarding risk evaluation and noted that in the large majority of Member States (23 for electricity, 24 for gas) the allowed cost of capital for regulated infrastructure is determined on the basis of the capital asset pricing model. This approach focuses on the identification of the level of systematic risk for the overall transmission activity. It is consistent with the hypothesis that different projects belonging to the transmission activity have the level of systematic risk of the overall transmission activity and that the non-systematic (diversifiable) risk can be eliminated or significantly reduced by the TSO or project promoter through diversification.   ACER recommended to NRAs a 7-step common risk evaluation methodology, which should consider the distinctive features of and the measures taken in the different national regulatory systems, in order to assess to what extent the risk for the project promoters is higher than the risk of a comparable project. Indeed, the available measures for mitigating the risk faced by project promoters may be different across Member States. In particular, ACER considered that project risks can be subsumed under five categories of risks from the perspective of project promoters: the risk of cost overruns, the risk of time overruns, the risk of stranded assets, risks related to the identification of efficiently incurred costs and liquidity risks.   Next, ACER assessed national practices regarding risk mitigation regulatory measures (rules for anticipatory investment, rules for recognition of efficiently incurred costs before commissioning of the project and other regulatory measures) and monetary reward or penalty schemes, which typically consist of rules for providing additional return on the capital invested.   As general principle, the risk-related incentives should be commensurate with the PCI’s specific risk level as borne by the project promoters, while NRAs may also grant incentives, where appropriate, to all infrastructure projects (for example benefit-related incentives that are independent of the risk profile of a project). Furthermore, ACER took the view that NRAs should be free to decide on the combination of regulatory measures and monetary reward/penalty schemes, while consistency between the national regulatory frameworks may be important for cross-border PCIs. The Agency also considered that the existing national frameworks already offer a wide span of regulatory measures that protect project promoters from many risks. On this basis, ACER provided its recommendation to NRAs for particular risk mitigation measures.

ACER_NEWS_0272	2014-06-16	ACER invites stakeholders to its 8th workshop on REMIT implementation	 ​The Agency will organise a public workshop on REMIT implementation in Ljubljana on 16 July 2014. The following topics will be addressed and discussed during the workshop: The ACER Requirements for the registration of Registered Reporting Mechanisms (RRM) and technical specifications for data submission The ACER User Manuals for the reporting of Trade and Fundamental data Latest developments of CEREMP        The RRM Requirements include the technical and organisational requirements that need to be fulfilled by reporting entities (RRMs) in order to submit data to the Agency. The User Manuals for the reporting of trade and fundamental data will provide market participants, and third parties reporting on their behalf, with sufficient guidance to make informed decisions about their transaction reporting obligations. The draft RRM Requirements and the draft reporting manuals were previously consulted in 2013 and early 2014 and will be further developed and consulted in 2014.    The Agency intends to launch a second public consultation on the draft RRM Requirements and the draft TRUM following the public workshop. First releases of the documents will be made available upon the entry into force of the European Commission’s Implementing Acts.  The workshop is intended to provide opportunities for stakeholders to express their views on the abovementioned topics. The input received during the workshop will be taken into consideration for the Agency’s ongoing work on the implementation of REMIT.

ACER_NEWS_0273	2014-06-10	ACER Annual Conference: Implementing REMIT can save millions of euros to EU consumers	 ​“As EU energy markets continue to integrate, it is important that customers can be confident that the prices they pay are not unduly distorted, but that they reflect the proper interplay of demand and supply” said EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger in his address to the Annual Conference of the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), held today in Ljubljana. This is the aim of REMIT, the EU Regulation on wholesale energy markets integrity and transparency, which establishes a new, unprecedented, sector-specific market monitoring framework to detect and prevent market abuse in European wholesale energy markets, where energy should be traded according to the highest transparency and integrity standards. The experience of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) – ACER’s counterpart in the United States when it comes to market monitoring – can give an idea of the kind of return which could be achievable from investing in REMIT. In 2013 FERC concluded several market abuse investigations, including two high-profile cases which resulted in unjust profits in the order of US$ 160 million being identified.   During the Conference the importance of guaranteeing the confidence of consumers in the energy markets and the need for appropriate funding of ACER for the successful implementation of REMIT was highlighted. “Market participants and energy consumers must be able to have full confidence on the integrity and transparency of European energy markets. It is absolutely critical that the Agency and National Regulatory Authorities have the skilled resources necessary to deliver on these expectations and to avoid any risk of market abuse going undetected”, said Lord Mogg, Chairman of the ACER Board of Regulators, which reunites representatives from all NRAs in the Member States.  You can find out more in ACER’s press release on the Conference.

ACER_NEWS_0274	2014-05-26	ACER recommends the adoption of the Network Code on Forward Capacity Allocation	 ​ACER published today a recommendation for the adoption of the Network Code on Forward Capacity Allocation for Electricity (FCA).   This Recommendation follows the resubmission of the Network Code by ENTSO-E on 2 April 2014. The Agency acknowledges the efforts of ENTSO-E to take into account elements proposed in the Agency’s Opinion on the Network Code of 18 December 2013  in particular with regards to the remuneration of long-term transmission rights.   However, the Network Code resubmitted by ENTSO-E to the Agency is in some aspects still not in line with the Framework Guidelines and the objectives stated therein, and lacks ambition regarding the implementation horizon.   The adoption proposed is subject to specific amendments addressing some concerns raised by ACER in its Opinion of December 2013 and not sufficiently tackled within the resubmitted Network Code. Among those, the two following aspects are of concern: the deadlines set to implement terms and conditions or methodologies and the firmness regime.   Additional information on the Network Code development process can be found here.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-recommends-the-adoption-of-the-Network-Code-on-Forward-Capacity-Allocation.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0275	2014-05-14	ACER welcomes the successful coupling of the day-ahead markets of Portugal and Spain with the North-West European region	 The organised electricity markets (power exchanges) in Portugal and Spain joined yesterday the day-ahead market coupling of the North-West Europe region, which took place last February. With this development, power exchanges covering 17 European countries are fully interlinked. The current market coupling between Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden will enhance further the development of the single EU energy market by favouring price convergence, which fosters competition and therefore leads to a better choice of services and products for consumers.   “The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) welcomes the go-live of the full day-ahead market coupling within and between the North-West and South-West Europe regions, which represents a new landmark towards the European single market” said ACER Director, Alberto Pototschnig today. The Chairman of the ACER Board of Regulators, Lord Mogg also expressed his satisfaction as “this very important milestone occurred as planned, just a few months after the launch of the day-ahead market coupling in North-West Europe.” This achievement rewards the intensive work performed by transmission system operators, power exchanges, national regulatory authorities and the Agency within the voluntary early implementation framework called the regional initiatives process.   The electricity markets of Italy and Slovenia are expected to join the coupled markets by the end of 2014. Also by the end of this year, within the Central-East Europe region, an initiative in Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia aims at implementing the so called Price Coupling of Regions5 which will constitute an important first step towards the future coupling between the Central-East and North-West Europe regions.

ACER_NEWS_0277	2014-04-11	Central Eastern Europe unites towards the EU single energy market	 ​The key electricity players in Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia have signed, together with the EU Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The MoU is aimed to couple the countries’ markets by using a flow-based method for calculating the capacities on the cross-border electricity interconnectors and by implicitly allocating these capacities based on the Price Coupling of Regions (PCR) solution.  This agreement between Transmission System Operators (TSOs), Power Exchanges (PXs), National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), is taking place in the frame of the Regional Initiatives (RIs) process coordinated by ACER. The RIs aim at the early implementation of the Network Codes - in this case the Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management Network Code – before they enter into force and become legally binding. The move will contribute to the development of the single EU energy market by favouring price convergence, which fosters competition and therefore leads to a better choice of services and products for consumers.   The project consists of flow-based capacity calculation on the one hand, and implicit capacity allocation based on the PCR solution, on the other hand, to be implemented in one single step. In so doing, it is in line with the European target model for day-ahead markets and ensures compatibility with other regional and cross-regional price coupling projects.    The MoU expresses the intention of the concerned TSOs and PXs to continue and intensify their cooperation in the Central-Eastern Europe (CEE) region. In addition to existing structures (e.g. among TSOs on capacity calculation), a common project structure and a detailed project plan are now to be established. This will be supported and monitored by the NRAs and ACER. The new project will enable coordination of the CEE region with other European regions in the electricity market to take common, coordinated steps to facilitate the process leading to the creation of the European Internal Energy Market (IEM).   The implementation of flow-based market coupling in the CEE region should both provide for efficient electricity wholesale price formation by linking the relevant day-ahead markets -  considering the most efficient generation in the region, and assess more precisely the available grid capacities on individual transmission network elements, thus also supporting and enhancing secure grid operation. Consumers in the CEE region will benefit from more competitive prices resulting from efficient trading arrangements and secure network operation, allowing also for the improved integration of renewable energy sources.   Access the press release here.

ACER_NEWS_0279	2014-04-10	ACER issues an Opinion on electricity national transmission plans	 ACER published yesterday its Opinion on National Ten-Year Electricity Network Development Plans, which includes a monitoring exercise with important input from 28 National Regulatory Authorities on the consistency of national plans with the plan developed by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) at EU level.  ACER identified: ·         51 national components of transmission investments in the ENTSO-E TYNDP 2012 which are not included in the national development plans. ·         24 national components of transmission investments in the ENTSO-E Regional Investment Plans 2012 which are not included in national development plans. ·       10 third party projects which are included (or at least referred to) in national development plans, while they are not in the ENTSO-E TYNDP 2012.  This exercise was carried out by ACER according to article 8(11) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009. Additionally, ACER also noted that the frequencies of publication are not aligned. ACER suggests that the publication of each national plan is every two years or more frequently, to allow for consistency with the ENTSO-E TYNDP (which has a biennial frequency). ACER also suggests that a coding system (unique for each investment) is adopted in each national development plan together with a mapping of correspondences with the ENTSO-E TYNDP coding. Finally ACER proposes the systematic publication of specific information for each investment item (commissioning date, investment status, increase of net transfer capacity, cost) in national development plans, as a practice consistent with the ENTSO-E TYNDP. ​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-issues-an-Opinion-on-electricity-national-transmission-plans.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0280	2014-04-08	ACER organises the 3rd Gas Target Model Stakeholders Workshop in Brussels	 ACER will hold the 3rd Gas Target Model Stakeholders Workshop on Thursday 15 May 2014 in Brussels at the CEER premises at Cours Saint-Michel 30a.   The purpose of this regulatory work is to further develop the regulatory vision for the design of the single European gas market in the light of recent changes and new challenges the gas sector is facing.   This workshop provides the opportunity for further discussions and stakeholder input on ACER's update of the Gas Target Model.

ACER_NEWS_0281	2014-04-01	ACER issues an Opinion on the Network Code on Electricity Balancing	 ​On 24th March ACER published its opinion on the Network Code on Electricity Balancing. The Agency notes the network code will bring significant added value in supporting the creation of a European balancing market and recognises ENTSO-E’s effort to align this network code to the related framework guidelines. However, this network code submitted to the Agency on 23 December 2013 is not in line with the related framework guidelines in some specific areas.   ACER calls for clear and legally binding requirements on TSOs to implement the integration models for electricity balancing within the timeframes specified in the framework guidelines. The Agency also considers the network code not ambitious enough in harmonising and standardising the core elements needed to achieve a well-functioning, competitive and integrated balancing market. In particular, the Agency expects improvements in the network code in the following areas:   Incentives on balance responsible parties to be balanced or help the electricity system to be balanced. A consistent framework to foster competition between balance service providers. Efficiency of balancing actions performed by TSOs.

ACER_NEWS_0282	2014-04-01	ACER assesses policy options for harmonised transmission tariff structures in the gas sector	 ​ACER published yesterday a justification paper assessing the policy options contained in the ACER Framework Guidelines on rules regarding Harmonised transmission tariff structures for gas. This document provides justification for the most important policy choices in order to achieve that harmonization, and supports the network code process of ENTSOG.   Challenges identified The Third Package requires a shift from point to point tariffs to entry/exit tariffs. That will allow gas to flow and change ownership more easily and flexibly, facilitating gas market integration, trading and competition. When developing the Framework Guidelines, ACER also reviewed how that entry/exit requirement could be best accommodated with regulatory measures that provide sufficient clarity, simplicity and flexibility for the gas markets to integrate.   During this work, the Agency identified some tariff structures justifiably relate to factors such as the maturity of the national gas system; supply and demand characteristics; and topological considerations. The view of ACER is that differences of tariff structures are acceptable where tariffs derive from an objective and transparent methodology, but inconsistent tariff structures across Member States make cross-border gas transportation unnecessarily complex for network users.   The Agency found as well that, where tariff structures lack objectivity or do not reflect system costs, this can lead to inefficient use of the transmission networks and potentially inefficient cross border gas trades. Unjustifiably high transmission tariffs for short term products can negatively affect wholesale market integration across hubs in the European Union.   Recommended policies The best performing policies, as assessed in the justification document, in the Agency’s view are consistent and in compliance with the Third Package objectives. They shall serve the integration of European networks and gas markets, allow for transparent and cost-reflective tariffication leading in the end to non-discriminatory access arrangements, in order for: Competition to develop in commodity markets, allowing market players to freely ship gas between market areas and respond to price signals to help gas flowing to where it is valued most; and Networks to be used efficiently, while guaranteeing adequate remuneration for network investments. The model has to also allow the removal of physical congestions that hinder market integration, where this is the case. Policy options were developed in response to regulatory challenges identified by the Agency. They are assessed against a set of objective criteria. The analysis is supported by evidence collected from a wide range of stakeholders. ENSTOG and its members are invited to expand the current justification document with additional evidence, underpinning all the points where the Network Code developed by ENTSOG completes or amends the policy options detailed in the Framework Guidelines and in the accompanying justification document.   Additional info: Framework Guidelines related documents  	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-assesses-policy-options-for-harmonised-transmission-tariff-structures-in-the-gas-sector.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0283	2014-03-31	ACER opens a public consultation on trade reporting under REMIT	 ​ACER launched today a public consultation on ACER’s Trade Reporting User Manual (TRUM) for trade reporting under REMIT.   The Agency welcomes comments, in particular related to the consultation issues listed in this consultation paper, by 5 May 2014 12.00 noon, Central European Time, to be sent to Remit.PublicConsultations@acer.europa.eu. In order to ensure transparency and full involvement of stakeholders, the Agency will organise a public workshop in Ljubljana on 3 April 2014, from 12.00 to 16.00, to collect stakeholders’ views on the public consultation document.   The draft Implementing Acts presented by the Commission in October 2013 provided that the Agency shall explain the details of the reportable trade information under REMIT in a user manual. On this basis, the Agency is currently preparing the Manual.  This public consultation paper is intended to collect views from all parties interested in the implementation of REMIT, including market participants, organised market places, etc. Please note that the draft TRUM is based on the data fields which the Agency currently expects for the Commission’s draft Implementing Acts. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-opens-a-public-consultation-on-trade-reporting-under-REMIT-.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0284	2014-03-20	ACER progress towards the update of the Gas Target Model	" At the 2nd ACER Gas Target Model (GTM) workshop held on 19th March in Ljubljana, over 60 representatives of the European gas sector – including gas suppliers, Transmission System Operators (TSOs), energy intensive industries and regulators – discussed how to adjust the target model to changed market requirements. The agenda focused on the functioning of wholesale gas markets, the contribution of the gas sector to sustainability and the state of play of retail competition in gas.   ""The fast changing global and European framework requires an enhancement of our vision of the future European gas market. This is key in order to ensure the competitiveness of European industries and that European end-consumers pay fair gas prices"" explained Mr Walter Boltz, Vice Chair of the ACER Board of Regulators. Participants at the workshop discussed the functioning of forward gas markets based on a genuinely new data set using comprehensive data of OTC transactions and pre-transactional data (order book) for the most relevant European gas hubs. The analyses performed show that the prices at European hubs are determined based on distinct supply and demand characteristics in the respective markets. This could favour a market design whereby each such gas market area should have a liquid spot and forward market. The data also makes it possible to quantify the gains resulting from narrower bid-ask spreads, which needs to be taken into account when performing a cost-benefit analysis on possible mergers of market areas. Furthermore, participants discussed the following topics: The uneven level of implementation of gas legislation and regulation across the EU, the corresponding uneven level of gas market development, and the question whether this calls for more targeted interventions; The liquidity of forward markets, and the number of liquid forward markets needed in the EU; The need for cross-border market zone mergers; The Congestion Management Procedures and whether these are sufficient to address all contractual congestion problems; The difficulties faced by gas-fired power generators and the extent to which aligning gas and electricity regulations at EU level could help to alleviate this situation; The state of play of retail competition in gas, and the question whether regulatory intervention at EU level would help to improve this situation.  Stakeholder input is key to the process and therefore ACER invites stakeholder to submit written comments by 18 April 2014 to the following e-mail address: gtmupdate@acer.europa.eu. The 3rd ACER Gas Target Model workshop will be organised on 15 May 2014 in Brussels at the premises of CEER, Cours Saint-Michel 30a.

ACER_NEWS_0287	2014-03-07	ACER finds market efficiency being affected by existing bidding zones configuration	 The existing electricity bidding zones configuration in Central Europe is currently affecting the efficient use of the infrastructure, the incentives to invest in both transmission and generation, and the liquidity of forward markets, according to the ACER report on the influence of existing bidding zones on electricity markets published today by the Agency.  The impact is particularly relevant in the central part of Europe (Austria, Benelux, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland), where the completion of the Electricity Target Model (in particular in the Eastern region) is being hampered, partly by disagreements about what an adequate bidding zones configuration should be.   The report is based on the Agency’s assessment and stakeholders’ feedback received during the public consultation on the influence of existing bidding zones on electricity markets launched in July 2013. It analyses the main effects of bidding zone configuration on the electricity markets of the central part of Europe.   ACER main findings   The report finds that the existing bidding zone configuration in central Europe is currently affecting:   The efficient dispatch of generation and social welfare, which are both effected by preventive congestion management (cross-zonal capacity calculation and allocation) and curative congestion management (remedial actions);  The distribution of social welfare due to the potential discrimination of market participants located at different geographical points in the network;  The incentives to invest in both transmission and generation; and  The liquidity, possibly in day-ahead but in particular in forward markets, where larger bidding zones provide more hedging opportunities than small bidding zones creating non-level playing field.   ACER recommendations   The report provides a set of recommendations to ENTSO-E who will carry out a full review process by comparing alternative bidding zones configurations in the above mentioned bidding zones of Central Europe.   According to the ACER report, the review of bidding zones to be performed by ENTSO-E should include, as a minimum, an assessment of the effects of different bidding zone configuration scenarios on the above mentioned market-related aspects. Other elements such as market power are currently perceived as less relevant factors triggering the decision of a bidding zone review in the CEE and the CWE regions, Denmark, Switzerland and Italy.   The Agency also acknowledges several remarks provided by stakeholders in the Public Consultation undertaken in the context of the report. First, stability of the bidding zones configuration is very important for market participants, who recommend that reviews of bidding zones configuration should not take place too often. Second, stakeholders request the utmost transparency when ENTSO-E and the Agency perform, respectively, the technical and market report within the assessment of bidding zones configuration. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-finds-market-efficiency-being-affected-by-existing-bidding-zones-configuration.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0288	2014-02-28	ACER finds contractual congestion still significant in Europe, but data are insufficient	 ​Contractual congestion in Europe, a situation where capacity demand exceeds the technical capacity, occurs on at least one third of the relevant Interconnection points (IPs) for gas transport between Member States, according to the first ACER Annual Report on Contractual Congestion at interconnection points published today. The report also highlights the lack of data for presenting a complete overview of this issue in Europe and calls on ENTSOG and TSOs to significantly improve the data quality and availability for next year’s report. According to the Commission Guidelines on the matter, if IPs are found to be congested in the ACER Congestion reports, a certain obligatory measure (the Firm day-ahead Use-It-Or-Lose-It mechanism) explained below to alleviate congestion has to be applied. The ACER report analyses capacity data in the monitoring period from 1 October to 31 December 2013 and also analysis capacity bookings until the end of 2015. ACER main findings ACER found that at least one third of the relevant IP sides, representing entry and exit for each flow direction at the IP, in the EU are congested. Among them, at least 45 of the congested IP sides are potentially subject to the mandatory application of the Firm day-ahead Use-It-Or-Lose-It mechanism, included in the Commission Guidelines, if congestion persists in the 2014 and 2015 ACER reports. This mechanism guarantees that firm daily capacity is made available to the market on the day before the gas flow, if the booked capacity is not fully used. Furthermore, ACER analysis shows that the Congestion Management Procedures of the Commission Guidelines were not widely applied across the EU and secondary trading of unused capacity was also  limited. Congestion has been identified in North-West Europe, where most data was available, but is also found in the rest of the EU. Lack of sufficient data did not allow presenting a complete overview of the situation in Europe. ACER recommendations ACER recommends ENTSOG and TSOs to increase data availability, quality and consistency on their platforms. The Agency also proposes to the European Commission that in the future the reports are published in June instead of March in order to provide a deeper analysis. ACER also requests National Regulatory Authorities to regularly check TSO data to ensure the quality, validity and completeness of information published.  	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-finds-contractual-congestion-still-significant-in-Europe,-but-data-are-insufficient.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0289	2014-02-20	ACER Board of Regulators follows up on the European Commission’s evaluation of the Agency	 The Agency’s Board of Regulators (BoR) supported yesterday in Brussels the general thrust of the European Commission’s (EC) Evaluation Report on the activities of ACER, published on 22 January 2014 and presented its recommendations. “Since its establishment, ACER has become a credible and respected institution playing a prominent role”, the EC’s report says. In that context, the ACER BoR highlighted how during its first three years of operation, ACER tasks have been carried out efficiently, effectively and in a timely manner. It also underlined that the Agency has been essential for further strengthening cooperation and coordination across national borders, including through its working arrangements, for introducing effective regulatory oversight at EU level and for supporting the emergence of a pan-EU perspective and the continuation of a cooperative European culture between NRAs themselves in order to develop the internal energy market.   Lord Mogg, Chair of the BoR said: “Those achievements deserve a huge vote of thanks to ACER Director Alberto Pototschnig and his staff as well as to NRAs, which are making a most valuable contribution. However, the significant support of NRAs must not distract attention from the imperative of ensuring ACER is appropriately resourced to allow it to meet its increasing legal obligations and political responsibilities”.   Following the Commission’s report, the ACER BoR has issued its Recommendations with regard to the main points in the Commission’s evaluation - which shows an overall positive feedback from ACER’s stakeholders.

ACER_NEWS_0290	2014-02-06	ACER publishes its Opinion on the ‘Proposal for Operation of the ENTSO-E Central Information Transparency Platform’	 ​ACER just published its Opinion on the ‘Proposal for Operation of the ENTSO-E Central Information Transparency Platform’. ACER notes that the Proposal contains a very concise description of how the Central Information Transparency Platform works.  ACER values that the Proposal also shows how that the platform will be made available online to the public free of charge and that the data offered can be easily accessed and downloaded. Since the Proposal does not explicitly state that the data will be updated and available for at least five years, or time-stamped, archived and made available to the public, the Agency expects that ENTSO-E will comply with those requirements. With regard to the costs of the Platform, however, ACER considers the information received from ENTSO-E insufficient for assessing its cost effectiveness. Accordingly, ACER concludes that it will only be able to make such assessment once ENTSO-E had provided additional information. The opinion has been issued pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EU) No 543/2013 of 14 June 2013 on submission and publication of data in electricity markets and amending Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-its-Opinion-on-the-Proposal-for-Operation-of-the-ENTSO-E-Central-Information-Transparency-Platform.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0292	2014-02-04	ACER welcomes the day-ahead market coupling in 15 countries and publishes its latest Status Review Report on Regional initiatives	 ​“The Agency welcomes the go-live of the day-ahead market coupling in the North-West Europe region, which covers 75% of the European power market” said ACER Director, Alberto Pototschnig today. “I am pleased that this very important milestone towards the completion of the Internal Energy Market has finally been achieved”, he stressed. Further information on this project, as well as ACER Status Review Report on Regional Initiatives containing other examples of voluntary early implementation of the network codes –common binding EU rules- can be found in the latest yearly Regional Initiatives Status Review Report published by ACER today.   As from today, this project allows organised electricity markets - power exchanges - covering 15 European countries to be closely interlinked. The market coupling between Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Sweden will significantly enhance the development of the single EU energy market by favouring price convergence, which fosters competition and therefore leads to a greater choice of services and tangible benefits for European electricity consumers. At the same time, as from today, Spain and Portugal, which have operated as an integrated market since 2010, will also use the same market coupling platform and contractual procedures.   This achievement rewards the intensive work performed by transmission system operators, power exchanges, national regulatory authorities and the Agency within the voluntary early implementation framework called the regional initiatives process.     Find out more in ACER’s press release.     The area in green is fully coupled as from today. Portugal and Spain will join in the coming months while Italy and Slovenia will do so at the end of 2014. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-welcomes-the-day-ahead-market-coupling-in-15-countries-and-publishes-its-latest-Status-Review-Report-on-Regional-initi.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0293	2014-01-31	ACER publishes an Opinion on the ENTSO-E guideline for cost-benefit analysis of grid development projects	 ACER published today an Opinion on the ENTSO-E guideline for cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of grid development projects. ACER welcomed the improvements in the CBA methodology published by ENTSO-E, which:   avoids double counting of economic effects; expresses the costs and some benefits in monetary terms; introduces new clustering rules favouring a more consistent approach to group complementary investments for a specific project; requires to construct and analyse contrasting future development scenarios; Identifies six parameters (demand, fuel cost, renewable energy sources, CO2 price, discount rate, commissioning date) for developing sensitivity analyses. Nevertheless, ACER also considered necessary that ENTSO-E adapts its CBA guideline according to nine specific recommendations before submitting it to the European Commission. Furthermore, ACER recommended ENTSO-E to develop a separate CBA guideline to identify specific benefits of electricity storage before the selection of projects of common interest taking place in 2015. ACER also stated its expectations for the Ten Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP) 2014 and for future CBA updates and improvements. According to the Agency, ENTSO-E should evaluate the application of this CBA guideline in the TYNDP 2014, in particular, assessing the new clustering rules and the new approach for scenarios development. Additionally, ENTSO-E should further monetise benefits, in particular the reduction of future costs for ancillary services and/or generation investments being avoided or deferred. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-issued-an-Opinion-on-the-ENTSO-E-guideline-for-cost-benefit-analysis-of-grid-development-projects.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0294	2013-12-20	ACER calls for improvements in the Network Code on Forward Capacity Allocation	 On 18 December 2013, ACER adopted its opinion on the Network Code on Forward Capacity Allocation. The Agency recognises ENTSO-E’s effort to align the Network Code to the Framework Guidelines and Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 and to involve stakeholders through a transparent process, maintaining a good level of stakeholder involvement. The Agency acknowledges the significant efforts of ENTSO-E to define the requirements and responsibilities of Transmission System Operators and other entities performing the functions within coordinated long-term capacity calculation, allocation and nomination in general. However, the Network Code submitted by ENTSO-E to the Agency on 1 October 2013 is in some aspects not in line with the Framework Guidelines and the objectives stated therein, and lacks ambition regarding the implementation horizon. ACER has requested several amendments to the Network code to ensure full alignment with the Framework Guidelines as well as consistency with other electricity network codes. In particular, the two following aspects are of concern: the deadlines set to implement terms and conditions or methodologies and the firmness regime. ACER considers that these suggestions can be addressed by ENTSO-E within a short period of time, in order for the Agency to recommend the Network Code for adoption to the European Commission.  	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-calls-for-improvements-in-the-Network-Code-on-Forward-Capacity-Allocation.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0295	2013-12-20	ACER published its Opinion on the ‘Manual of Procedures for the ENTSO-E Central Information Transparency Platform’	 ​On 18 December 2013 ACER published its Opinion on the ‘Manual of Procedures for the ENTSO-E Central Information Transparency Platform’ pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 543/2013 of 14 June 2013 on submission and publication of data in electricity markets and amending Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council. In this Opinion ACER acknowledges that ENTSO-E’s draft Manual of Procedures contributes to the objectives of Regulation (EU) No 543/2013 and in principle addresses appropriately the criteria set by Article 5 of this Regulation. The Agency also identifies several aspects still to be taken into account by ENTSO-E when finalising the Manual of Procedures. ACER points out that the Central Information Transparency Platform will publish information which is also relevant for Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 (‘REMIT’). In this context inside information as outlined in the 3rd edition of the ACER Guidance on the application of REMIT should be considered. Information is to be added to the draft Manual of Procedures following the completion of the web form design. ACER stresses its expectation of being updated on this completion and reserves itself the right to reassess the Manual.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-published-its-Opinion-on-the-%E2%80%98Manual-of-Procedures-for-the-ENTSO-E-Central-Information-Transparency-Platform%E2%80%99.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0296	2013-12-20	ACER published its Opinion on the Draft ENTSO-E Work Programme Autumn 2013 through December 2014	 On 18 December 2013, ACER published its Opinion on the ‘Draft ENTSO-E Work Programme Autumn 2013 through December 2014’ In this Opinion ACER came to the conclusion that ENTSO-E’s work programme for 2014 is in principle in line with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 713/2009 and Regulation (EC) No 714/2009. Overall, it considers the ENTSO-E work programme a fair compromise between concise and detailed information. In some areas however ACER believes additional clarification would be useful to better explain the scope of activities. For instance, ACER recommends ENTSO-E: to list particular deliverables not merely in a table by their title but also with regard to their content; to include a short description of the network codes directly in the work programme; to consider in the context of the work on the implementation of the forthcoming network codes also the monitoring and the analysis of such implementation; to specify plans regarding market developments for the long-term timeframe and regarding capacity calculation; to consider an early preparation of a comprehensive description of the methodology applied to develop the visions and scenarios for the TYNDP 2014 and a submission of the TYNDP 2014 to ACER for opinion earlier than December 2014; to extend the work on recommendations relating to the coordination of technical cooperation between Community and third-country TSOs also to countries other than Turkey; to describe the research and development activities in more detail to enhance their understanding. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-published-its-Opinion-on-the-Draft-ENTSO-E-Work-Programme-Autumn-2013-through-December-2014.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0298	2013-12-03	ACER issues guidance to ENTSOG on the first network code amendment	 ACER published today – along with the Framework Guidelines on Harmonised Transmission Tariff Structures – its guidance to ENTSOG on the development of amendment proposals to the Network Code on Capacity Allocation Mechanisms (NC CAM) on the matter of incremental and new capacity. The NC CAM focuses on the allocation of existing capacity at interconnection points (IPs), while harmonised market-based processes for the identification, offer and allocation of incremental and new capacity at existing or new IPs are yet absent. Therefore - and as recommended by the Madrid Forum - regulators developed the CEER Blueprint on Incremental Capacity, which formed the basis for the present consolidated ACER guidance. This guidance will be basis of the first amendment to the NC CAM. The document develops principles for when and how capacity beyond existing capacity shall be offered and allocated to network users. It also stipulates the integration of incremental and new capacity to capacity allocation within the NC CAM’s annual yearly capacity auctions. At the same time it foresees provisions on when open season procedures can be applied (e.g. in case of large and complex projects extending across more than two market areas). ACER’s guidance also sets out requirements for information provision and co-ordination between TSOs and NRAs for the related processes. The tariff provisions and economic tests are considered as inputs to the capacity allocation procedures and shall be developed under the Network Code process on Harmonised Transmission Tariff Structures. Within the framework provided by ACER’s guidance paper, ENTSOG may develop, consult and propose detailed amendments to the NC CAM to ACER by the end of 2014. The Agency will consult them with stakeholders and may make a reasoned proposal for amendments to the Commission, which may in turn launch a Comitology procedure to make them legally binding.

ACER_NEWS_0299	2013-12-03	ACER publishes Framework Guidelines on harmonised gas transmission tariff structures	 ACER published today its Framework Guidelines on rules regarding harmonised transmission tariff structures for gas. Following a written procedure held in November, these Framework Guidelines received a favourable opinion from ACER Board of Regulators and were submitted to the European Commission. Following invitation by the Commission the Framework Guidelines will be used by ENTSOG to develop the relevant Network Code. There is currently a heterogeneous approach to tariff setting for gas transmission services among EU Member States.  This makes using EU gas transmission networks more complex for network users, can lead to inefficient use and development of the transmission networks, and, potentially, to inefficient gas trades.  By defining a set of common parameters, based on economic principles, for all aspects of tariff setting, and a common set of requirements on the publication of data relating to each stage in the process, the Tariff Framework Guidelines, and subsequent Network Code, is intended to improve the efficiency of gas trade and competition, which is a key objective of the Third Package. Following the Commission’s request in March 2013, that the Framework Guidelines include more specific aspects related to tariff methodologies, the text includes an expanded chapter on cost allocation methodologies, compared to the version informally endorsed by the BoR in April 2013.  This chapter specifies four possible cost allocation methodologies (two with variants), and obliges NRAs to approve implementation of one methodology, subject to a detailed explanation and reasoned justification against the methodology ‘circumstances’ criteria, a cost allocation text, and a methodology counterfactual.        Following invitation by the Commission, in the coming weeks, the Framework Guidelines will be used by ENTSOG to develop the Network Code on harmonised gas transmission tariff structures. Additional information on the process can be found here.Find ACER Citizens' Summary on this topic here. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-Framework-Guidelines-on-harmonised-gas-transmission-tariff-structures-.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0300	2013-11-28	Consumers still to benefit from energy market integration in the EU	 ​Despite the economic downturn, gas and electricity prices rose significantly in 2012 according to the latest market monitoring report presented today in Brussels by the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER).  On average, electricity prices for households increased by 4.6% in 2012. Gas prices rose by 10%. Price regulation did not prevent an increase in the electricity and gas bills. Participants also debated about the findings on the progress achieved so far in the energy market integration as well as the barriers identified in the report.  The event counted on the support of the Lithuanian EU Presidency and most representatives from key energy players were present.   According to Lord Mogg, Chair of ACER’s Board of Regulators and CEER President:  “The advantages brought about by the single market, such as lower wholesale electricity prices or a more efficient use of interconnectors identified in the study, still have fully to benefit final consumers in the retail market.”    “Delivering greater benefits to European consumers also requires completing the Internal Energy Market, while removing barriers to retail competition. Effort to achieve this goal by the end of 2014 should be stepped up through full implementation of the third package, adoption of the network codes and their early implementation. Any delay will cost European consumers billions of Euros annually”, said ACER Director, Alberto Pototschnig.   How can consumers get a better deal?   Switching supplier is a way in which consumers can obtain better deals. However, consumers in the EU seem not to take full advantage of this opportunity. In some jurisdictions, this is due to insufficient competition. In fact, network charges, taxes and other administratively set charges, including those to cover the costs of renewables support schemes – which may together account for up to half the energy bill – reduce the fraction of the overall energy price on which retailers can compete. This is aggravated by rising commodity prices in the gas sector. However, even where competing suppliers operate in the market – and a number of Member States have witnessed a growth in the presence of foreign energy suppliers, according to the report - and switching may deliver savings, most consumers show inertia, mainly due to a lack of awareness, consumer loyalty or risk aversion.   What is the status of energy market integration?   ACER and CEER have identified a general degree of progress in terms of price convergence on European wholesale gas and electricity markets and a more efficient use of the network – with the average utilisation rate of the high-voltage grid increasing from 60% at the end of 2010 to 76% in 2012. However, in some areas of Europe the challenge posed by the integration of renewables is leading to a decrease in the degree of price convergence when compared with the previous year. The report also found that, although gas is now more often traded on spot markets, there are still quite a few oil-linked contracts which, together with a lack of clarity in cross-border tariffs, cause some economically inefficient gas flows from more expensive areas towards cheaper ones. Furthermore, the study shows that as demand decreases, contractual congestion declines and liquefied natural gas is increasingly being diverted away from Europe.   Find out more: Press release Presentation Citizens summary ​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Consumers-still-to-benefit-from-energy-market-integration-in-the-EU.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0301	2013-11-25	ACER calls for improvements in the Gas Network Code on Interoperability and Data Exchange Rules	 ​On 21 November 2013, ACER has adopted its Reasoned Opinion on the Network Code on Interoperability and Data Exchange Rules. ACER acknowledges ENTSOG’s effort in preparing the Network Code through a transparent process, maintaining a good level of stakeholder involvement. The Network Code shows a high degree of compliance with the Agency’s Framework Guidelines on Interoperability and Data Exchange Rules of 26 July 2012. The code’s provisions on the development process and content of harmonised Interconnection Agreements (including default rules, such as on flow control, measurement, matching processes and gas quantity allocation) are considered important and appropriate measures to ensure commercial and operational cooperation between adjacent transmission system operators at interconnection points. These rules, along with other provisions of the code (on common units, monitoring and management of gas quality differences, common data exchange solutions and a plan for removing barriers related to differences in odourisation practices), play a fundamental role in facilitating cross-border gas transport and trade. ACER has requested a number of amendments to the Network code to ensure full alignment with the Framework Guidelines as well as consistency with other gas network codes. In particular, ACER has demanded that transmission system operators (TSOs) in control of the relevant equipment become the responsible party in relation to the default provisions of an Interconnection Agreement. ACER has also called for enlarging the scope of application of common data exchange solutions, which shall apply also to hub-to-hub users. Moreover, ACER has requested allowing the application of other data exchange formats to the extent that such formats are compatible with the one proposed in the code. Finally, ACER has demanded the removal of redundant provisions on TSO cost recovery.Further refinements on the structure and legal consistency have been also proposed by the Agency. ACER considers that these suggestions can be addressed by ENTSOG within a short period of time, in order for the Agency to recommend the Network Code for adoption to the European Commission.

ACER_NEWS_0303	2013-11-12	ACER recommends adoption of the Operational Security and Operational Planning and Scheduling Network Codes	 ​ACER published today a recommendation to the European Commission for adopting the Network Code on Operational Security and the Network Code on Operational Planning and Scheduling, as resubmitted to ACER on 24 September, subject to few prior amendments. For both Network Codes, those amendments are notably related to the level of national scrutiny, the performance indicators and the transparency. For the Network Code on Operational Planning and Scheduling, an additional amendment needed is related to the category of “Outage Coordinating TSOs”. Besides the mentioned amendments, ACER flags a few minor concerns which would improve the Network Codes if addressed before the adoption process. They relate, among other reasons, to the scope of application of the Network Codes, the criteria applicable for determining the scope of data exchange with significant grid users in the Network Code on Operational Security as well as, for the Network Code on Operational Planning and Scheduling, the forecasting obligations and the Availability Plans.   Additional information can be found here. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-recommends-adoption-of-the-Operational-Security-and-Operational-Planning-and-Scheduling-network-codes.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0308	2013-09-30	ACER recommends the adoption of the Network Code on Load-Frequency Control and Reserves	   On 26 September, ACER adopted its opinion and also a recommendation on the Network Code on Load-Frequency Control and Reserves. ACER acknowledges that the Network Code is in line with the Framework Guidelines on Electricity System Operation, and the objectives stated therein, and thus recommends its adoption by the European Commission.   ACER still flags a few areas in which the Network Code could be clarified, namely the competence and involvement of national regulatory authorities and/or other relevant national authorities, the provision of full activation of continuous FCR for a minimum time period of 30 minutes and the sharing of FCR. Since these clarifications do not affect the compliance with the Framework Guidelines on Electricity System Operation, ACER advocates that they are addressed by the European Commission when adopting the Network Code. Find related documents here.   In order to inform the drafting of the opinion and recommendation on the Network Code on Load-Frequency Control and Reserves as well as to ensure transparency and involvement of stakeholders, the Agency invited all interested stakeholders to express in writing their views on this Network Code.

ACER_NEWS_0311	2013-08-09	ACER releases guidance document on the implementation of the guidelines for Congestion Management Procedures	 The purpose of the non-binding guidance for NRAs on the implementation of the CMP guidelines, published today by the Agency, is to identify areas requiring a harmonised approach between Member States regarding the Congestion Management Procedures (CMP) guidelines and to elaborate recommendations, where necessary, to avoid diverging interpretations at national levels. The Congestion Management Procedures guidelines were published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 28 August 2012 and entered into force on 17 September 2012.   Several provisions of the CMP guidelines require cross-border coordination and cooperation between NRAs and TSOs from different Member States for a successful implementation. Beyond the NRAs’ duty to ensure strict compliance with the guidelines, regulators are also expected to have regard to best practices at European level and to “endeavor to harmonize processes for the implementation of these guidelines” (Recital 7 of the CMP guidelines).   A draft version of this guidance document was presented and discussed as informal working paper during a roundtable on 12 June 2013, gathering stakeholder associations and the European Commission. ​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-releases-guidance-document-on-the-implementation-of-the-CMP-guidelines.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0313	2013-07-31	ACER opens a public consultation on the influence of existing bidding zones on electricity markets	 The consultation launched by ACER today on the influence of existing bidding zones on electricity markets originates from the on-going discussions among National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and the Agency about the appropriateness of existing bidding zones to achieve a well-functioning electricity market in Europe. This has resulted in a joint initiative of ACER and ENTSO-E to perform a review of existing bidding zones based on the process defined in the draft Network Code on Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management (CACM). The stakeholders are invited to provide their views on how the existing bidding zones influence the functioning of electricity markets and to respond to consultation questions by 30 September 2013. Access the public consultation here.​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-opens-a-Public-consultation-on-the-influence-of-existing-bidding-zones-on-electricity-markets.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0314	2013-07-30	ACER calls for a much stronger coordination of resource adequacy policies to maximise the benefits of the Internal Energy Market	 In view of both recent and future developments, ACER has assessed the impact of different Capacity Remuneration Mechanisms (CRMs) on the functioning of the Internal Electricity Market in a report published today. It observes that the lack of coordination has resulted in a patchwork of CRMs in the EU, which may be at the detriment of the market integration process. The report highlights the risks of short- and long-term distortions to the functioning of the IEM if the design of CRMs affects the natural price formation in the energy market and promotes a better coordination of security of supply measures at regional and European level. This report follows the Opinion on Capacity Markets provided by the Agency to the European Parliament’s Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) Committee in February 2013 and is offered as a contribution to the forthcoming European Commission’s Communication on public intervention in the electricity sector, including capacity mechanisms. ​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-calls-for-a-much-stronger-coordination-of-resource-adequacy-policies-to-maximise-the-benefits-of-the-Internal-Energy-M.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0315	2013-07-23	ACER publishes opinions on projects of common interest for trans-European networks	 ACER published its opinions on proposed projects of common interest (PCI) for trans-European networks for electricity and gas in 2013. While taking into account the difficulties encountered during the preparation of the draft regional lists of PCIs and some methodological weaknesses of the process, the Agency believes that the draft regional lists of gas, electricity transmission and electricity smart grids projects merit adoption as the first Union list of PCIs. The Agency suggests complementing the 2013 Union list by additional information about the degree of maturity, costs and benefits of each individual PCI, and believes that the complementary information could be added soon after 31 October 2013 -deadline for the submission of investment requests by project promoters. The Agency also notes that all PCIs will be fully reassessed in the next PCI selection round, in line with the Regulation 347/2013 and that the assessments should follow the detailed recommendations provided in the two Agency opinions. Such recommendations include, among others: the set-up of a proper data base needed for the consistent assessment of the projects; the continuation of work by ENTSOs to further improve the Ten Year Network Development Plans for use in PCI selection; the improvement of data collection by using revised questionnaires for project promoters; the application of a consistent clustering approach throughout Europe; and the timely development of sound cost-benefit analysis methodologies that would include the monetisation of costs and benefits.​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-opinions-on-projects-of-common-interest-for-trans-European-networks.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0322	2013-06-20	ACER calls for improvements in the Network Code on Operational Planning and Scheduling	 ​On 19 June 2013, ACER adopted its opinion on the Network Code on Operational Planning and Scheduling. In the document ACER commends ENTSO-E for the effort in preparing the Network Code, which mostly complies with the criteria and requirements defined in the Framework Guidelines on Electricity System Operation.  ACER also notes that the timely adoption of this Network Code is important for the security of supply, as well as the completion and well-functioning of the internal market in electricity and cross-border trade, including the delivery of benefits to customers and the facilitation of the EU’s targets for the penetration of renewable energy sources. However, in its opinion ACER also highlights a few areas where improvement is needed before it can be satisfied that the Network Code is fully in line with the Framework Guidelines and can be recommended for adoption to the European Commission. The main areas of concern are the national scrutiny, transparency, compatibility and coherence with the other network codes developed pursuant to Articles 6 and 8(6) of Regulation (EC) No 714/2009, performance indicators as well as the scope and application of the Network Code. ACER considers that these areas can be addressed within a reasonable period, through targeted amendments to the Network Code, by improving the drafting of the Network Code provisions or, where relevant, amending the supporting document. To this end, the Agency is fully committed to support ENTSO-E in this process.   Annexes to the opinion: The Network Code on Operational Planning and Scheduling submitted on 29 March; ENTSO-E’s supporting document to the submitted Network Code: Supporting Document for the Network Code on Operational Planning and Scheduling. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-calls-for-improvements-in-the-Network-Code-on-Operational-Planning-and-Scheduling-.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0327	2013-04-26	ACER finds that gas Transit Contracts in seven EU Member States do not comply with EU rules	 The Agency’s report on gas transit contracts published today found that the compliance of these contracts with the legal requirements of the Third Energy Package, as well as competition law, remains one of the key shortcomings in some parts of the EU. The inquiry shows that legacy transit contracts remain in at least seven countries, and in most cases there is evidence that gas in transit is treated differently compared to gas for national consumption. The report provides an overview of the results of the inquiry and presents an analysis of the access regime and regulatory treatment of the historical long-term contracts for the transfer of natural gas within the EU for the purpose of delivery to another country. The findings of the report are based on an inquiry started by ACER in June 2011 and performed during the course of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 and have been recently made available to the 23rd Madrid Forum.  	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-finds-that-gas-Transit-Contracts-in-seven-EU-Member-States-do-not-comply-with-EU-rules-.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0328	2013-04-23	ACER observes high compliance with gas transparency requirements but full conformity still to be achieved	 The ACER analysis on transparency in gas markets published today reveals that the level of compliance with transparency requirements is generally high and that Transmission System Operators (TSOs) are making remarkable improvements in both the content and the form of the information they publish. A fair degree of compliance is currently observed in a majority of areas, and significant steps have also been taken in other areas where there is still however room for improvement. The inquiry was carried out in cooperation with TSOs, ENTSOG and national regulatory authorities (NRAs). The analysis presented in this document covers 43 TSOs from 21 EU Member States. The analysis was initiated at the request of network users for further transparency and user-friendliness in TSOs’ websites, and following an invitation from the European Commission and from the European Gas Regulatory Forum (Madrid Forum). The study was carried out over the year 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 and looked at the level of compliance with the requirements of Chapter 3, Annex 1 of Regulation (EC) No 715/2009. The results of this analysis have been presented at the 22nd and 23rd Madrid Forum editions in October 2012 and April 2013, respectively. ​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-observes-high-compliance-with-gas-transparency-requirements-but-full-conformity-still-to-be-achieved.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0334	2013-03-27	ACER recommends the adoption of the Network Code on Demand Connection	" ​On 25 March 2013, ACER adopted its opinion and a recommendation on the Network Code on Demand Connection.  ACER acknowledges that the Network Code is in line with the Framework Guidelines on Electricity Grid Connections, and the objectives stated therein, and thus recommends its adoption by the European Commission. ACER recognises the potential for notable benefits deriving from the timely, effective and efficient rollout of demand side response in the near future; however, it does not consider that the Network Code is the best vehicle for delivery of demand side response at distribution level. Moreover, ACER flags a number of areas in which the Network Code should be improved. Since these improvements mostly relate to drafting and do not affect the compliance with the Framework Guidelines on Electricity Grid Connections, ACER advocates that they are addressed by the European Commission when adopting the Network Code. The main areas of improvements relate to the provisions of the Network Code related to national scrutiny, the scope of the national scrutiny of the reactive power ranges to be implemented at the national level, the roles and responsibilities of different parties and processes with regard to the demand side response requirements, the roles and responsibilities of aggregators (including the clarification of the different possible approaches to demand aggregation) and the compliance testing and monitoring for small grid users.

ACER_NEWS_0336	2013-03-12	ACER issues an Opinion on Capacity Markets upon request of the European Parliament	 There is a growing concern in several EU Member States that electricity markets, given the current market design and the growing shares of (intermittent) renewable power generation, will not be able to deliver sufficient capacity to meet electricity demand at all times. The political sensitivity to blackouts, as well as uncertainties about when investors will build new generation based on market prices, has compelled a number of Member States to intervene in order to ensure that the required amount of capacity is available. Some Member States intervene or have the intention to intervene by introducing so-called capacity markets.It is in this context that the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, upon request of the European Parliament’s Committee for Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), provided its opinion of 15 February 2013 on capacity markets.​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-issues-an-Opinion-on-Capacity-Markets-upon-request-of-the-European-Parliament.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0339	2013-02-18	ACER publishes the 2012 Report on regional initiatives for completing the EU gas and electricity market	 Among the main achievements highlighted in the ACER Regional Initiatives Status Review Report 2012 ,  the development of the Roadmap for the early implementation of the Network Code on Capacity Allocation Mechanisms (CAM NC) represents a step forward for the Gas Regional Initiative, as it adopts with it a more project-oriented and cross-regional approach. With regard to the Electricity Regional Initiative (ERI) where four of such Roadmaps have been in place since the end of 2011, most foreseen key milestones towards the creation of the Internal Electricity Market have been reached although some delay has been experienced. Progress and challenges in the electricity field The European Price Coupling project has experienced delay but the 2014 deadline is still reachable: in spite of the obstacles, the launch of the North-West Europe/Price Coupling of Regions project in November 2013 and its fast extension to neighboring regions are the main elements to turn this challenge into a success. The Intraday project acknowledged a major delay, but a pilot solution is to be delivered in 2013: although a major Power Exchanges (PXs)’ disagreement severely delayed the project, the situation has been settled with the development of a call for tender. Once the outcome is known, Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and PXs will go ahead with the implementation with the market participants’ involvement. Harmonised allocation rules for long-term rights are on track: following the work on the “wish-list”, its finalisation and implementation are the first challenge. In parallel to the ongoing extension of CASC.EU, a regional platform dedicated to the allocation of transmission rights, integration of the current bilaterally managed borders to existing platforms is another key target. Finally, the impact of the review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) and of the existence of different forward market organisations in Europe will also be carefully addressed. The implementation of the flow-based method has been postponed due to operational difficulties and the loop-flow issue: following difficult discussions on technical parameters or the loop-flow issue, both the Central-West Europe and the Central-East Europe regions should progress thanks to the very last developments. Progress and challenges in the gas field Early implementation of Capacity Allocation Mechanisms (CAM) and CAM pilot projects: the elaboration of the CAM Roadmap represents a step forward for the Gas Regional Initiative, which adopts with it a more project-oriented and cross-regional approach. The CAM Roadmap is composed of several pilot projects and platforms aiming at the early implementation of coordinated, market-based allocation of bundled cross-border capacity products in line with the CAM Network Code (NC) provisions. The CAM Roadmap has been endorsed by ACER’s Board of Regulators and ENTSOG’s Board in January 2013 and now enters its implementation stage. The experience gained from the CAM Roadmap may lead to the development of similar Roadmaps for the early implementation of NCs in other areas such as Gas Balancing and Interoperability. Other contributions of the GRI projects to the European single market: in addition to the work on the CAM Roadmap and pilot projects on CAM, the three gas regions (North-West, South and South South-East) have been working extensively during 2012 on a number of regional projects in different areas, in conformity with their respective Work Plans 2011-2014. The Status Review Report summarises the main achievements of these projects in 2012. The main challenge for the GRI in 2013 is to remain a forum achieving tangible results in specific projects on different areas, in line with the Work Plans 2011-2014. Next to that, the GRI should continue to be used for the exchange of information, sharing of good practices among regulators and operators, and learning from the experience in regional projects.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-the-2012-Report-on-regional-initiatives-for-completing-the-EU-gas-and-electricity-market-.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0340	2013-02-18	ACER publishes opinions on ENTSOG's Annual Winter Supply Outlook and Annual Report	 ​The Agency has adopted an Opinion on ENTSOG’s Winter Supply Outlook 2012/13, where it appreciates ENTSOG’s consideration of additional High Daily Demand (two-week period of high-daily demand and supply disruption case) and an enlarged geographical scope. The Agency also suggests ENTSOG to devote greater attention to the analysis of supply and transmission trends and actual gas flows.ACER has also adopted an Opinion on ENTSOG’s 2011 Annual Report. The document provides concise information and a good coverage of ENTSOG’s priorities related to the development of network codes, the preparation of a ten-year network development plan, supply adequacy outlook, seasonal supply outlooks, and operational tools, as well as the completion of the operational and functional establishment of ENTSOG. The Agency recommends the next Annual Report to be somewhat more expanded with precise information, in order to avoid any potential doubts about the adequacy of ENTSOG’s activities. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-publishes-opinions-on-ENTSOG's-Annual-Winter-Supply-Outlook-and-Annual-Report.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0341	2012-12-21	ACER calls for amendments of the Network Code on Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management for Electricity	 On 19 December 2012, ACER issued its Opinion on the Network Code on Capacity Allocation and Congestion Management for Electricity (CACM). ACER welcomes the significant effort of ENTSO-E to define requirements and responsibilities of TSOs and other entities performing functions within coordinated capacity calculation, allocation and congestion management for the day ahead and intraday timeframe. ACER also commends the stakeholders’ engagement by ENTSO-E in the preparation of this Network Code. However, in its opinion, ACER highlights a few areas where the Network Code does not fully comply with the respective Framework Guidelines. As this Network Code is pivotal to the completion and functioning of the Internal Energy Market, ACER invites ENTSO-E to address the concerns raised in the opinion and to submit a revised Network Code to ACER as soon as possible. ​	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-calls-for-amendments-of-the-Network-Code-on-Capacity-Allocation-and-Congestion-Management-for-Electricity.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0346	2012-08-01	Transparency in European Gas Markets: ACER organises public consultation and workshop	 ​Transparency is a vital element for ensuring effective third party access and overall functioning of a competitive internal gas market. Regulation (EC) No 715/2009 includes a number of transparency requirements, going beyond those foreseen in the previous legislation.     ACER is now examining the level of compliance of TSOs against these gas transparency requirements.   An inquiry was opened since November 2011, with the cooperation of National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) through the Gas Regional Initiative, and TSOs were asked to provide their own assessment of their level of compliance through Excel questionnaires. But in some cases, the assessment had to be carried out by NRAs.    Ideally, the assessment of the level of compliance with transparency requirements should be checked and validated by NRAs as well as stakeholders. This is why, responses to the TSO questionnaires have been submitted to public consultation with stakeholders from the North-West and South gas Regions .   In order to complete the public consultation process, ACER  launched on 31 July a public consultation on Transparency in Gas Markets  and is seeking stakeholder views on the TSO responses to the transparency questionnaire from the remaining countries, i.e. those which are not included in the North West and South gas Regions.   A public workshop on Transparency in Gas Markets will be held in ACER premises in Ljubljana on 13 September 2012, in order to allow TSOs, NRAs and other stakeholders to express their views and provide their feedback to ACER before the final results are presented in the 22nd Madrid Forum in October 2012. TSOs, NRAs and stakeholders from all Member States, including the North West and South regions, are welcome to participate.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Transparency-in-European-Gas-Markets-ACER-organises-public-consultation-and-workshop.aspx
ACER_NEWS_0347	2012-06-26	REMIT: Registration format adopted	 ​ On 26 June 2012, ACER adopted a Decision determining the registration format to be used for the establishment of the future European register of market participants. This is a further important step towards the implementation of the Regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT).   Indeed, before an EU-wide monitoring tool of the wholesale energy market is set up, one which will be able to record each transaction, REMIT foresees the creation of a European register of market participants. This means that market participants will have to register with their national energy regulatory authority. ACER was asked to decide on a format that could be used all accross Europe and which would guarantee a coordinated implementation of the Regulation without creating unnecessary burden for stakeholders. This is why before adopting the format, ACER organised a public consultation, which led to a simplification of the proposed format. The adoptiong of the registration format by the Agency does not mean that the registration of market participants will start as of tomorrow. Indeed, the REMIT Implementing Acts have to be adopted before any European register of market participants is established. The Implementing Acts will be adopted following the comitology process (negotiations between Member States and the European Commission). Right now, the Implementing Acts are foreseen at the earliest in mid-2013. No registration will take place before.But ACER had to fulfil its task of adopting a registrating format before end of June, which it did. The details of the reporting format can be found in the annex to the Decision. 	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/REMIT-Registration-format-adopted.aspx

ACER_NEWS_0349	2012-06-21	Public Consultation on REMIT records of transaction launched	   Following the Regulation, ACER has launched on 21 June 2012 a public consultation on its draft recommendations on the records of transactions which it considers are necessary to effectively monitor the wholesale energy market. Indeed Article 7(3) of Regulation states that ACER 'shall consult interested parties before making recommendations to the European Commission as to the records of transactions, including orders to trade'. ACER should in particular consult with national regulatory authorities, competent financial authorities in the Member States, national competition authorities and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) but also with all other interested parties. The public consultation on the records of transactions will last until 31 July 2012, 12.00 noon, Central European Time.  A public workshop is organised on 19 July 2012 in Ljubljana on the public consultation document as well as the 2d edition of ACER non-binding guidance on the application of the definitions of Article 2 of the Regulation.	https://www.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Public-Consultation-on-REMIT-record-of-transaction-launched.aspx
