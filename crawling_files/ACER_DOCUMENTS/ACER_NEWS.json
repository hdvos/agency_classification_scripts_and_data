ACER also identified some PCIs that did not advance their status over the past six years (with most of them remaining in the permitting phase). This led ACER to conclude that project promoters' projections were too optimistic.The report also warns about potentially non-robust PCIs, which did not carry out any work or activity during the reporting period, being on hold or rescheduled by the project promoters for at least 2 years, and/or failed to move forward from an early advancement status for several years. ACER calls for additional scrutiny during the PCI selection for such projects to ensure the robustness of the 5th PCI list, so that only projects which are clearly a priority are included.\u200b\u200b\u200bRobust PCIs are crucial to achieve carbon-neutral energy systems in the futureEnergy networks play a key role in the transition to carbon-neutral energy systems. As PCIs are key cross-border electricity and gas infrastructure projects that enhance the links between the energy systems across Europe, they also play a crucial role in helping the EU to achieve its energy policy and climate objectives by delivering socio-economic and environmental benefits.Access the PCI Report\u200b and related Annex I for project specific information on electricity PCIs and Annex II for further information on Gas PCIs.----------------------------------------------------\u200b-------------------------------Background information\u200bBy way of background, the broader framework in Europe for cross-border energy infrastructure (the TEN-E framework) is currently under negotiation by the European Parliament and the Council.Here, ACER, together with CEER, has made several recommendations on how to improve the overall PCI framework (including the governance of infrastructure development, the scope of PCIs and the TEN-E processes) with the aim of promoting a neutral and independent technical assessment and ensuring support to those projects bringing most benefits for the European Green Deal and to avoid any risks of unjustified costs for consumers.

In particular, bidding zone borders shall be based on long-term, structural congestions in the transmission network and the configuration of bidding zones shall be designed in such a way as to maximise economic efficiency and to maximise cross-zonal trading opportunities, while maintaining security of supply.What can you learn in this webinar?This webinar will present ACER's high-level approach for the definition of alternative bidding zone configurations as well as how clustering algorithms can be applied on nodal simulation results to support the identification of alternative bidding zone configurations.A public consultation on relevant aspects of this high-level approach is planned to be launched shortly after this webinar takes place.\u00a0\u200b\u200b"}, {"id": "ACER_NEWS_0003", "date": "2021-06-04", "url": "https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-to-decide-on-the-long-term-cross-border-capacity-calculation-methodology-for-the-Core-region,-comprised-of-13-Member-S.aspx", "title": "ACER to decide on the long-term cross-border capacity calculation methodology for the Core region, comprised of 13 Member States", "text": " Section 1 Body Html\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bThe National Regulatory Authorities of the Core region asked the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) to decide on the long-term capacity calculation methodology (LT CCM) for the region.The Core region comprises 13 countries: Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Croatia, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.What are the benefits?Long\u2010term cross-border capacity calculation promotes effective long\u2010term cross\u2010zonal trade. By calculating reliable capacities and making them available to market participants at an early stage, long-term capacity calculation allows for long\u2010term planning and provides hedging opportunities.The long-term capacity calculation methodology for the Core region shall cover yearly and monthly capacity calculation processes, by applying the flow-based approach.How exactly will this ACER Decision contribute to a more integrated European electricity market?ACER's Decision will contribute to the effectiveness and integration of the Core electricity markets by establishing the common rules for calculating the long-term cross-zonal capacity at regional level. \u200bNext steps:ACER will launch a public consultation for four weeks; expected dates are from 5 \u2013 31 July 2021.On 9 July, ACER will organise a workshop on this topic.\u200b\u00a0ACER expects to reach its decision by 3rd November 2021.\u200b\u200b"}, {"id": "ACER_NEWS_0004", "date": "2021-06-02", "url": "https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-releases-its-second-70-target-report-on-the-minimum-margin-available-for-cross-zonal-electricity-trade-in-the-EU.aspx", "title": "ACER releases its second 70% target report on the minimum margin available for cross-zonal electricity trade in the EU", "text": " Section 1 Body Html\u200bEurope's Clean Energy Package (CEP) has set a binding minimum 70% target for electricity interconnector capacity for cross-zonal trading (the 'minimum 70% target'), to be met by all Transmission System Operators (TSOs).The minimum 70% target is legally binding since the start of 2020, but Member States may also adopt transitory measures, such as action plans or derogations, thus allowing TSOs to reach gradually the minimum 70% target, by the end of 2025 at the latest.Why is monitoring the 'minimum 70% target' im\u200bportant?The lack of sufficient cross-zonal capacity in between Member States\u00a0\u200bis one of the main barriers to the integration of electricity markets, and market integration is key to deliver on Europe's energy goals. Larger amounts of cross-zonal capacity made available for trade increase cross-border competition and enhance the integration of renewable energy sources.ACER's monitoring aims to identify consistently across the EU the scope for improvement to meet the minimum 70% target.\u00a0How are Member States doing? Efforts needed in all countries to reach the 70% targetACER's second \u201c70% Target Report\" provides an overview of the levels of margins for cross-zonal capacity compared to the minimum legally binding 70% target for the second half of 2020, and on action plans and derogations. It also highlights the changes compared to the first report (which related to the first half of 2020).Ma\u200b\u200bin findings of the report:Member States have much more to do to get closer to the legally binding minimum 70% target.The levels of margins for cross-zonal capacity is mixed across the EU and are broadly similar to the levels observed in the first \u200bhalf of 2020.Member States should work to meet the 70% minimum target at all times, and to reach their target national transitional targets to gradually reach the 70% minimum.How? Members States can count on several measures at their disposal to improve the level of margin offered such as cost-efficient investments; use of remedial actions; and bidding zone reconfiguration, to help them to reach the target.The levels of cro\u200bss-zonal capacity are very diverse depending on the type of border and geographical location:- On high-voltage Direct Current (DC) borders, the 70% target was met most of the time but with a few notable exceptions.- On Alternating Current (AC) borders, there is a very diverse picture with significant room for improvement to meet the 70% target for most regions and borders.ACER's monitoring depends critically on TSOs providing robust and extensive data. ACER acknowledges the efforts made by a majority of TSOs\u00a0to improve the provision of data. However, the completeness and quality of this data needs to be urgently improved in some regions.Regarding action plans and derogations, ACER finds significant room for further harmonising their setup across the EU. Regulatory authorities should grant derogations as a last resort measure, and only where necessary for maintaining operational security.For consistency, national regulatory authorities (NRAs) should consider the results of ACER's analysis to assess the compliance of TSOs with the minimum 70% target.\u200bAccess to the\u00a0ACER's comprehensive Report and detailed Annexes\u200b"}, {"id": "ACER_NEWS_0005", "date": "2021-05-28", "url": "https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Gas-contractual-congestion-decreases-by-50-in-the-EU--.aspx", "title": "Gas contractual congestion decreases by 50% in the EU", "text": " Section 1 Body Html\u200b\u200bThe EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) found a halving of gas contractual congestion in the EU transmission networks according to its 8th specialised report on the subject published today. Contractual congestion may signal a reduction of market efficiency. It happens when some network users were not able to obtain the capacity product of their choice and had to rely on congestion-mitigating measures (CMPs)\u00a0to access the gas market.8th Congestion Report\u00a0in the EU Gas Markets and How it is Managed\u200bTechnical Annex to the Report\u00a0\u200bHas COVID-19 effected gas capacity auctions? In 2020, the occurrences of auction premia, which arise when requests for capacity exceed the offer, dropped by 70% compared to 2019. COVID-related uncertainty as well as general demand and supply dynamics may affect whether auction premia will return in 2021 or remain scarce at around 0.6% of all auctions in scope of the analysis. How much congestion? In 2020, congestion has halved compared to previous years with 19 Interconnection Point (IP) exit and entry sides\u00a0in 2020 compared to 37 exits and entries in 2019). \u00a0Half of the congestion is due to auction premia, which occurred in the auctions of yearly and quarterly capacity products. The other half is due to the lack of offer of any capacity products with a duration of one month or longer.Has any progress been registered? While the number of congested IP sides is low, local contractual congestion can be severe and reduce market efficiency. Around 85% of the congested IP sides in 2020 were also congested in the past. What comes next? Transmission System Operators ('TSOs') can apply a number of CMPs\u00a0to ensure network users can access the network even when they could not obtain some capacity products in the primary capacity auctions. The Oversubscription mechanism remains the most applied CMP despite its decreased use in 2020; that decrease is partly compensated by an increased use of Firm Day-Ahead Use-It-Or-Lose-It and Surrender as CMP measures.More than 60% of the congested IP sides are already covered by the FDA UIOLI mechanism, while for the other half the respective National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) need to take action in line with the European Commission's rules on congestion. Main recommendations ACER recommends the European Commission to revise the CMP Guidelines to enhance the effectiveness of the measures. ACER recommends ENTSOG and TSOs to continue improving data reliability to ensure the accuracy of information available at the ENTSOG Transparency Platform. ACER's call on researchersThe Congestion Report has a narrow scope of analysis, while a substantial amount of congestion data is available for deeper and broader analysis. The report has suggestions for further research and ACER calls on researchers to use the substantial amount of available data to study different aspects of congestion in EU gas markets."}, {"id": "ACER_NEWS_0006", "date": "2021-05-26", "url": "https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-published-a-Decision-requesting-information-to-monitor-the-level-of-margin-available-for-cross-border-electricity-trad.aspx", "title": "ACER published a Decision requesting information to monitor the level of margin available for cross-border electricity trade in the Nordics", "text": " Section 1 Body Html\u200bThe EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) published today a Decision requesting the three Nordic transmission system operators Svenska kraftn\u00e4t (Sweden), Energinet Elsystemansvar A/S (Denmark) and Fingrid Oyj (Finland) to provide specific information related to those network elements that are limiting the capacity calculation, the so-called critical network elements with contingencies (\u201cCNECs\").This information is needed by ACER to monitor the level of margin available for cross-border trade on CNECs and to compare it with the 70% minimum target defined by the Electricity Regulation.Access the ACER Decision 03/2021 and related Annexes.\u200b"}, {"id": "ACER_NEWS_0007", "date": "2021-05-18", "url": "https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Registration-open-for-ACER-webinar-on-its-proposal-for-a-Framework-Guideline-to-establish-a-Network-Code-on-Cybersecurity.aspx", "title": "Registration open for ACER webinar on its proposal for a Framework Guideline to establish a Network Code on Cybersecurity (27 May 2021)", "text": " Section 1 Body Html\u200bACER organises this online webinar to present and explain the content of its proposed non-binding\u00a0Framework Guideline on sector-specific rules for cybersecurity asp\u200bects of cross-border electricity flows.The event will take place on Thursday 27 May 2021, from 09.30 to 12.00.Register by Tuesday 25 May and access the agenda.\u200b The importance of cybersecurity is increasing, given the growing technological\u200b development and a more digitally driven and interconnected energy system.

Despite ongoing efforts, the framework also fails to properly assess the contribution of gas projects to sustainability.The TYNDP core building blocks need to be improved such as scenarios development and cost-benefit analysis (CBA). There are also shortcomings in public consultations with stakeholders on key elements of the energy projects being proposed by network operators.A number of shortcomings could be remedied by legislators in the current TEN-E reforms by strengthening the independent assessment of projects and the regulatory oversight of network operators. ACER has previously pointed to risks of lack of neutrality of the two European Networks of Transmission System Operators (ENTSOs) and the need for step changes in TEN-E governance to avoid conflict of interests while ensuring transparency.See also the ACER Opinion on the ENTSO-E electricity network plan.\u200bShortcomings could be remedied by improving the TEN-E RegulationThe EU framework for energy infrastructure needs to be robust for cost-efficient cross-border projects which are best for the energy transition. ACER believes that the shortcomings of the TYNDP process as can be remedied by improving the TEN-E investment framework in line with the European Green Deal. To this end, regulators (ACER and CEER) issued two position papers, one in March 2021 and one in June 2020\u200b on how to improve the revision of TEN-E Regulation including on infrastructure development governance.ACER has called on the European co-legislators to consider the regulators' proposals as a solution to promote a neutral technical assessment of infrastructure projects in line with the European Green Deal, avoiding risks of unjustified costs to European consumers.For example, currently the transmission system operators (TSOs), through the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSOs), develop the scenarios to assess projects in different futures. TSOs can be perceived as biased towards favouring more infrastructure as it is in their interest. The neutrality of scenarios and the credibility of the TYNDP process can thus be compromised. To safeguard neutrality, regulators have proposed the introduction of ACER framework guidelines for TYNDP scenarios for the ENTSOs to follow. This has been taken up in the European Commission's legislative proposals but should be further strengthened and streamlined, as suggested by regulators.Europe's energy regulators have pointed to the need for strengthened regulatory scrutiny over the ENTSO's to safeguard the public interest, for ACER to be given the powers to approve the methodologies for the Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBAs) which are used to assess projects, and to issue binding guidelines to the ENTSOs for the TYNDP development. What are ACER's key findings of the 2020 draft gas TYNDP?ACER has issued an Opinion on the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG) TYNDP 2020 for gas. The ACER Opinion is addressed to ENTSOG, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council.ACER finds that the draft gas TYNDP 2020 follows a similar methodology as previous editions. What are the key improvements in the 2020 draft gas TYNDP?ACER's opinion notes limited improvements and evolution of the draft plan in comparison to previous TYNDP. Improvements are mainly limited to a better presentation of results and for the first time, the inclusion of a heterogeneous category of projects addressing the energy transition. ACER concurs with ENTSOG that current gas infrastructure in Europe is resilient, near to the completion of the internal gas market and that the limited infrastructure investment gaps will be closed in the next five years by projects already currently under development. What are the key shortcomings of the 2020 draft gas TYNDP?ACER regrets that the TYNDP includes a broad investment portfolio of conventional gas projects close to \u20ac 75 billion, clearly exceeding reasonable needs, in view of the lack of market appetite for developing additional transmission capacities and the decarbonisation objectives. Less than half of these are assessed by ENTSOG in the TYNDP framework. As regards the sustainability assessment of projects, although progress in observed in this TYNDP, there is room to refine it further in the future.ENTSOG should consider ways to increase stakeholders' interest and engagement in the TYNDP development process, in view of the low number of responses (9) received during its public consultation.ACER identifies 4 main shortcomings:Lack of proper analysis of the existing and forecasted use of gas infrastructure as critical criterion to take into account when analysing the need of additional gas infrastructure.Shortcomings in the applied methodologies, such as a lack of a complete quantitative needs assessment and doubtful quality of the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) methodology and its application which still requires improvement to demonstrate benefits exceed costs so that each individual gas project contributes to sustainability.The asymmetric treatment of candidate projects depending on whether the projects are intending to apply for Project of Common Interest (PCI) selection or not. ACER expects ENTSOG to apply project-specific cost-benefit analysis for all projects, the same way it is done for the electricity.Shortcomings in the public consultations of the scenarios methodology and the needs methodology.In ACER's Opinion the draft gas TYNDP 2020 does not sufficiently contribute to the objectives of non-discrimination and efficient functioning of the market.What does ACER recommend for improving future gas TYNDPs?ACER is of the view that improvements in European infrastructure planning are feasible. ACER encourages the ENTSOs to address the remaining shortcomings and stands ready to provide guidance or clarifications where needed. ACER proposes several recommendations to ENTSOG in pursuit of an efficient, further integrated and transparent network planning at the service of consumers, decarbonisation, and sector integration ambitions:For the Final Gas TYNDP 2020Consider the National Regulatory Authority's (NRA's) comments on the TYNDP 2020 projectsProvide a feedback document on how the Public Consultation and ACER's Opinion have been taken into accountClassify the energy transition projects into gas supply/ production projects and network related investmentsComplete information related to project CBA assessments Update information on projects' status by end of year 2020For the Gas TYNDP 2022 and beyondImplement ACER's recommendations on scenariosImprove planning process to avoid recurring delays, by publishing next TYNDP by mid-2022Incorporate the market perspective on infrastructure gapsImprove the implementation of CBA methodologyInclude a number of \u201cconventional\" gas infrastructure projects commensurate to the assessed needs, by flagging and filtering out unrealistic projects during the data collection stageRoll out modelling tools allowing for sector-integrated assessments of electricity and gas projectsProvide the same (maximum) level of cost transparency for all TYNDP regulated projectsMore attention focused on adaptations of gas infrastructure for the injection of higher shares of renewable, low carbon and de-carbonised gases (hydrogen, synthetic methane, and bio-methane) Together with ENTSO-E, identify suitable locations for power-to-gas installations in the system needs analysisFactor the level of utilisation and congestion of existing infrastructure in the needs assessmentConsider ways of covering methane emissions associated with gas infrastructureWhat is the TYNDP?Every two years, ENTSOG publishes a non-binding TYNDP which looks forward over a ten-year horizon and includes a European supply adequacy outlook for natural gas. TYNDPs are essential for assessing and identifying the need of new infrastructure projects to ensure an adequate level of security of gas supply, market integration and competition.

With respect to electricity, in ACER's view:\u200bThe TYNDP core building blocks such as scenarios development, infrastructure needs identification and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) implementation need to be improved. There are also shortcomings in public consultations on key elements of the methodologies used for the assessment of the energy projects being proposed by network operators.A number of shortcomings could be remedied by legislators in the current TEN-E reforms by strengthening the independent assessment of projects and the regulatory oversight of network operators. ACER has previously pointed to risks of lack of neutrality of the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSOs) and the need for step changes in TEN-E governance to avoid conflict of interests while ensuring transparency. See also the ACER Opinion on the ENTSOG gas network plan\u200b.\u200bShortcomings could be remedied by improving the TEN-E RegulationThe EU framework for energy infrastructure needs to be robust for cost-efficient cross-border projects which are best for the energy transition. ACER believes that the shortcomings of the TYNDP process as can be remedied by improving the TEN-E investment framework in line with the European Green Deal. To this end, regulators (through ACER and CEER) issued two position papers, one in March 20\u200b21 and one in June 202\u200b\u200b0 on how to improve the revision of TEN-E Regulation including on infrastructure development governance. ACER has called on the European co-legislators to consider the regulators' proposals as a solution to promote a neutral technical assessment of infrastructure projects in line with the European Green Deal, avoiding risks of unjustified costs to European consumers.For example, currently the transmission system operators (TSOs), through the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSOs), develop the scenarios to assess projects in different futures. TSOs can be perceived as biased towards favouring more infrastructure as it is in their interest. The neutrality of scenarios and the credibility of the TYNDP process can thus be compromised. To safeguard neutrality, regulators have proposed the introduction of ACER framework guidelines for TYNDP scenarios for the ENTSOs to follow. This has been taken up in the European Commission's legislative proposals but should be further strengthened and streamlined, as suggested by regulators.Europe's energy regulators have pointed to the need for strengthened regulatory scrutiny over the ENTSO's to safeguard the public interest, for ACER to be given the powers to approve the methodologies for the Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBAs) and to issue binding guidelines to the ENTSOs for the TYNDP development. What are ACER's key findings of the 2020 draft electricity TYNDP?ACER has issued two Opinions on the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) TYNDP 2020, one on methodological aspects of the electricity TYNDP 2020 and one on the TYNDP projects. The ACER Opinions are addressed to ENTSO-E, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council.What are the key improvements in the 2020 draft electricity TYNDP?The ACER Opinions acknowledge that the TYNDP process is complex and resource intensive, and needs to be carried out within a two-year timeframe. For the elec\u200btricity TYNDP, ACER welcomes a number of improvements for instance in the so-called Inclusion Guidelines, the data collection process, the needs identification, and the transparency of the CBA assessment.What are the key shortcomings of the 2020 draft electricity TYNDP?ACER's opinion notes limited improvements and evolution of the draft plan in comparison to previous TYNDP and identifies 4 main shortcomings:Delays of scenario development process and lack of data release which compromised the integrity of the TYNDP. Unbalanced CBA due to the missing, non-traceable Current Trends scenario.Lack of CBA analysis after the study year 2030.Poor and insufficient consultations of the scenarios methodology and of the needs methodology.\u200b\u200bIn ACER's opinion the draft electricity TYNDP 2020 does not sufficiently contribute to the objective of efficient functioning of the market.What does ACER recommend for improving future electricity TYNDPs?ACER encourages the ENTSOs to address the remaining shortcomings and stands ready to provide guidance or clarifications where needed. ACER proposes several recommendations to ENTSO-E in pursuit of an efficient, further integrated and transparent network planning to serve European consumers and Europe's decarbonisation and sector integration ambitions:For the Final Electricity TYNDP 2020Provide the storyline and full data for the missing Current Trends scenario. Publish the baseline capacities per border as used in the starting grid for the needs exercise and in the reference grids for the CBA calculations. Include a Benefit / Cost ratio and Net Present Value calculation for all projects for each of the four scenarios.For the Electricity TYNDP 2022 and beyondRestructure the scenario development process in order to be completed by December of the year before the TYNDP.Involve relevant stakeholders and experts in the development of scenario assumptions.Ensure transparency of scenario development and availability of scenario data. All scenarios should be used in the needs exercise and the CBA analysis in a balanced way, using the premise of economic growth.Early and substantial consultation of the needs methodology (including important parameters like the horizons to be studied, the zones modelling, the climatic years to be used).Define an appropriate starting network for the needs identification. Duly implement the provisions of the TYNDP Inclusion Guidelines - non-compliant projects should be excluded. Consider the impact of the 70% minimum interconnection capacity target in the modelling of the power system, where relevant.Transfer capacities should be calculated for all projects and with more granularity and transparency.Consult the main elements of the TYNDP CBA (e.g. study horizons, criteria for the construction of the reference grid, scope of the CBA) before the inclusion of projects in the future TYNDP.Build the reference grid considered for the CBA analysis, according to the Agency's recommendations. ENTSO-E should extend the study horizons for which a CBA analysis is conducted for the TYNDP 2022 at least to one study year after 2030 (e.g. 2035 or 2040).What is the TYNDP?The main objectives of the TYNDP are to:\u200bidentify investment gaps (including cross border capacitiescontribute to a sufficient and non-discriminatory level of cross-border interconnections, the effective competition and the efficient functioning of the market, andensure a greater transparency of the European electricity transmission network.\u200bThe TYNDP builds on national investment plans prepared by the transmission system operators (TSOs) and takes into account the regional investment plans, published every two years.Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) are selected from the TYNDP via a separate process led by the European Commission. The TYNDP should provide essential and comprehensive information for the selection of PCIs, in particular through complete, monetised, and reliable cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and assessment of projects.What is the role of ACER and its overall assessment?ACER issues an opinion on the draft network plan developed by network operators taking into account the objectives of non-discrimination, effective competition, and the efficient and secure functioning of the internal electricity market.

When comparing gas sourcing costs in 2020 to their average between 2012-2019, prices declined by 8 Euros/MWh.The assessment measures the average yearly price at which nationwide suppliers can source their wholesale gas. The calculation considers the prices of products traded at the national hubs as well as declared cross-border gas imports and domestically produced gas.The main drivers of the price decline were the demand\u00a0reduction caused by COVID-19 and the highest-ever liquefied natural gas (LNG) deliveries registered during the first half of 2020. These resulted in historically low EU hub spot prices in the second quarter of 2020. The decline in the prices of other energy commodities and the above average underground storage stocks at the beginning of the injection season were other contributing factors. Even though hub prices partly recovered from the third quarter, average yearly supply sourcing costs reached their record low since ACER started to assess them in 2012.Convergence in sourcing prices remained overall robust amongst a majority of Member States, with the largest differences rounding about 3 Euros/MWh. This demonstrates the benefits of the Internal Gas Market. For example, in 2013 sourcing cost spreads of more than 5 Euros/MWh were frequent, implying extra yearly expenditure from 40 to 60 Euros for the average final household consumers in higher costing gas markets. Increased convergence in gas sourcing cost is estimated to have yielded\u200b average annual welfare gains in the range of 3 billion Euros for EU gas consumers since 2013.\u200bSource: ACER and Energy Community calculation based on Eurostat Comext, ICIS Heren and National Regulatory Authorities.Note: Gas sourcing cost within a given Member State vary per shipper and supply period, shaped by the features of the various contracts, hedging strategies as well as distinct supply origins. To infer an average yearly gas supply price, the Agency uses a methodology that considers three main types of sourcing costs (see MMR 2015, Annex 6): i) based on an explicit basket of hub products (in markets with sufficient forward transactional activity), ii) based on declared cross-border imports and iii) based on domestic production prices. The map displays the arithmetic average of all sourcing mechanisms; the report will contain the exact price estimates per supply mechanism.Despite the impact of COVID-19 on gas demand and the enhanced availability of liquefied gas, the average gas price did not decline uniformly across the EU. This resulted in some price gaps between the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) hub-based benchmark and the sourcing costs of some Member States. Prices were higher on average at Member States with a higher reliance on long-term supply contracts indexed either to oil or longer-curve' hub products. The highest average sourcing costs were reported in Southern East, Mediterranean and some Central East Member States. All Baltic countries (excluding Finland), and also Greece, reported very price-competitive import prices in 2020. ACER considers that in both cases this is due to the larger relative indexation to hub prompt products in their more recent LNG supply contracts.Sourcing costs at the Energy Community Contracting Parties were uneven, shaped by the characteristics of the diverse markets. In the majority of them, gas prices continued to be somewhat higher than for the average of EU Member States due to a prevalence of less favourable long-term contracts and more limited upstream supply competition. However for example in Ukraine the price gap have lessened following market reforms that have made import prices more correlated with EU hubs. Ukraine retains also ample cost-competitive domestic gas production.In a related exercise, the upcoming 2020 ACER Gas Wholesale Market Monitoring Report will analyse the level of price convergence of spot products traded at EU hubs. The preliminary results indicate a strong price alignment across the North West European region, where price differences against the TTF benchmark remained below 1 Euro/MWh for almost all trading days, as the figure below illustrates. Hub spreads commonly remain below transportation costs despite the gradual expiration of long-term capacity contracts, which is reducing in turn EU shippers' short-run marginal costs bidding (the Market Monitoring Report will analyse this trend in depth). Record liquefied gas deliveries and flexible North Sea supplies, together with the structural fostering of hub trading at the region, are deemed as limiting price decoupling.While hub price convergence tends to be stronger at regional level, Central and South Eastern hubs, as well as Mediterranean and Baltic ones, still show some higher spreads when comparing against the TTF benchmark. Those differences arise because of higher transportation tariffs as well as from the specific interplay of marginal supply and opportunity pricing at the individual markets.\u00a0 Nonetheless, overall, spot price alignment increased year on year with lower demand combined with high liquefied gas deliveries and storage stocks. The improvement was notable at the Hungarian, Italian and Spanish hubs. For example, unusually, the Italian hub quoted at a discount to the Austrian hub across the summer months, on the grounds of extra liquefied gas deliveries.Sourcing costs and hub price individual assessments will be further examined in the next edition of the Gas Wholesale Market Monitoring Report, to be published in July 2021. Furthermore, the report will focus on presenting the results of the ACER Gas Target Model metrics for the year 2020 as well as on assessing the effects of gas network codes implementation. It will include a new chapter identifying the contributions that the gas sector can make to the EU decarbonisation ambitions.\u00a0"}, {"id": "ACER_NEWS_0018", "date": "2021-04-16", "url": "https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Gas-tariffs-reports-ACER-recommends-Lithuania-to-better-justify-its-domestic-tariffs-and-the-mechanisms-used-to-compensate-.aspx", "title": "Gas tariffs reports: ACER recommends Lithuania to better justify domestic tariffs and mechanisms to compensate the discount granted to Klaip\u0117da LNG entry", "text": " Section 1 Body Html\u200b\u200bIn its second report on the implementation of the European Union (EU) Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff Structures for Gas in Lithuania, the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) recommends the Lithuanian national regulatory authority for Energy (VERT) to better substantiate that no discrimination is induced by the difference between the two tariffs applied to domestic consumers.

What are the fallback procedures?In the event that the single day-ahead market coupling process is unable to produce the results of the day-ahead coupling, the fallback procedures of the Core CCR foresee the execution of shadow auctions. Current shadow auctions in the Core CCR are based on the explicit allocation of electricity in the form of Physical Transmission Rights (PTRs). The procedures for these shadow auctions and the requirements for the participation of market participants are laid down in Annex II of this Decision - Shadow Allocation Rules (SARs)\u200b. What are the consequences of this amendment?With the implementation of this new amendment, there will be a change of the publication deadline of the shadow auction results from 13:50 CET to 14:00 CET on the day preceding the electricity delivery. The change of publication deadline is a result of the change in the Single Day Ahead Coupling (SDAC) operational timings in order to allow more time for the price coupling algorithm to calculate day-ahead results and thus alleviating some burden from the algorithm due to its growing performance requirements.

ACER and national regulators have a long experience in terms of network development for electricity and gas as well as with the implementation of the TEN-E Regulation. In essence, ACER and the regulators focus on 2 main issues:the quality of the tools to assess infrastructure needs and projects' value according to European energy policy objectives, and the role of regulators and the Agency in the governance of the European Projects of Common Interest (PCI) process, ensuring they can effectively oversee TSOs' tasks and decide on projects implementation.By way of background, already In July 2020, regulators set out their recommendation to the European Commission (as it began developing its proposals on revising the Trans-European Energy Networks Regulation) in the ACER\u200b-CEER position paper on revision of the TEN-E Regulation and Infrastructure Governance\u200b. When the European Commission's revised TEN-E Regulation proposals were published in December 2020, ACER and CEER flagged up the need for further improvement for energy network development (see the ACER-CEER Press Release\u200b).With the exception of the introduction of ACER framework guidelines for scenarios development, ACER's role (in the Commission's proposals) is\u00a0weakened due to the lack of regulatory scrutiny of offshore network development plans and due to the proposal to limit ACER's and NRAs' ability to assess investment requests. In other areas in need of better regulatory oversight, no structural improvements are included.\u200bThe ACER-CEER position paper (March 2021) sets out and makes recommendations on 9 main issues:Assessment of projects through CBAs \u2013 facilitating infrastructureAssessment of projects in different futures \u2013 scenario developmentOffshore grid planning should be fully integrated in the European grid planningCross border investment decisions should be exclusively a competence of the national regulatory authority (NRA) and, where relevant, ACERSpecific provisions on risk-related incentives are not necessarySimplification of Regional GroupsProjects of mutual interestImplications of amended gas project categoriesImplications of the abolition of natural gas projects.\u200b"}, {"id": "ACER_NEWS_0025", "date": "2021-02-26", "url": "https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Continental-Europe-electricity-system-separation-incident-of-8-January-2020.aspx", "title": "Continental Europe electricity system separation incident of 8 January 2021: Next steps", "text": " Section 1 Body Html\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bUpdate of 26.02.2021\u200bACER and ENTSO-E issue a\u00a0joint Press Release\u00a0as the Expert Panel begins its invest\u200bigation.Next steps:ACER and national regulators join ENTSO-E's Expert Panel investigating the electricity system separation of the Continental Europe synchronous area on 8 January 2021\u200b.\u200b\u200bThe Expert Panel will first meet on 4th March 2021.\u200bENTSO-E's\u00a0Interim Report\u00a0is published\u200b\u200bThe Expert Panel will identify the causes and make recommendations in a Final Report.Update of 01.02.2021\u200bOn 8 January 2021, the synchronous area of continental Europe's electricity system split into two separate regions\u00a0resulting in transmission system outages.\u00a0The re-synchronization of the two regions incident was resolved within an hour.In accordance with the ENTSO-E's Incident Classification Scale Methodology (ICSM), the incident has been assessed as a\u00a0Scale 2 (\u201cextensive incident\").For Scale 2 incidents, a detailed report shall be prepared by an Expert Panel (EP) of Transmission System Operators (TSOs).

Power-to-Gas consists of transforming electricity into renewable gases, and thus contributing to optimise the energy system as a whole with renewables.This paper is the second in a new series of ACER/CEER European Green Deal Regulatory White Papers following the publication of the pure hydrogen networks paper earlier this week. The aim is to deepen understanding on the regulatory aspects of Green Deal issues and to assist the European Commission in assessing various options as part of the preparations for legislation on hydrogen and energy system integration.The paper\u200b provides the following 7 recommendations on regulating power-to-gas facilities:Revisit the current set of definitions for major activities in the context of integrated gas and electricity sectors Consider investment and management of power-to-gas installations as market-based activities which are open to competition among market playersAllow involvement of system operators in the development and operation of power-to-gas installations only in exceptional cases Include power-to-gas installations and their suitable locations in system needs analysisDefine cost-reflective network tariffs, which should be applied to comparable activities across the electricity and gas sectors in a technologically-neutral wayAvoid distortive effects of taxes and levies on the integrated energy systemEnsure traceability of renewable energy throughout the integrated energy system.Background\u200b\u200bEnergy System Integration consists of taking advantage of synergies between the various energy carriers (electricity, heat, cold, gas, solid and liquid fuels) and the end-use sectors (buildings, transport, industry) in order to achieve an EU carbon neutrality by 2050.Following the release of the European Commission's European Union Green Deal at the end of 2019, the European Commission issued the Communication \u201cPowering a climate-neutral economy: An EU Strategy for Energy System Integration\" (July 2020), which proposes policy and legislative measures at EU level to\u200b gradually shape a new integrated energy system.Do you want to know more about Energy System Integration?\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bYou can consult the related section of ACER's website, which provides an overview on Energy System Integration and on the work in progress of the European Commission, the European Parliament and of ACER.

It also touches upon how some energy transition activities (e.g. Power-to-X facilities, Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations and energy communities) are treated in the tariff methodologies, which in turn may play a role in their uptake.\u200bWhy are distribution network tariffs important?The electricity transmission and distribution networks are the backbone of the energy systems and play a key role in the energy transition. Network tariffs recover the network operators (Transmission System Operators and Distribution System Operators) costs. In order to support overall system efficiency, tariffs should be designed to provide:\u00a0appropriate incentives to the system operators to build and operate the networks optimally; and \u00a0economic signals to network users.The effectiveness of such signals depends on factors such as the type of network user and the share of the network costs in the final bill.How is the electricity distribution tariff design linked to sustainability and the energy transition?Tariffs can be designed in multiple ways. Finding the right balance between various tariff setting principles (e.g. cost recovery, cost reflectivity, efficiency, non-discrimination, transparency, non-distortion, simplicity, stability, predictability and sustainability) is a complex task. As Europe strives to decarbonise its energy system (with a strong focus on electrification, increased renewables and a more active role of network users) the complexities increase. Hence, how distribution tariffs are designed can become increasingly important, but also increasingly complex.What are the main findings and recommendations of the ACER distribution tariffs report? The ACER report provides various recommendations. For example:There should be a common understanding of the term \u201cdistribution tariffs\" by differentiating it from other regulated tariffs paid by users connected to the distribution network;The NRA's role in tariff setting should be strengthened;Tariff methodologies should allow stakeholders to reasonably predict the tariff evolution (e.g. ACER recommends a tariff methodology period of at least 4 years, with a yearly update of the tariff values based on the drivers defined by the tariff methodology and on inflation);Transparent and effective stakeholder involvement should be ensured;Transparency in distribution tariff setting should meet at least a minimum standard;A minimum set of distribution cost categories should be differentiated to facilitate comparison;Distortive effects when setting tariffs for injection and for withdrawal should be avoided;Distribution tariff bases should reflect cost drivers;The interaction between price signals of distribution tariffs and other price signals should be paid attention;\u00a0Different treatment of the same user group should be avoided, unless properly justified.EU legislation requires ACER to issue (and update every 2 years) a best practices report on electricity tariff methodologies. National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) shall duly take the ACER best practice reports on transmission and distribution tariff methodologies into consideration when fixing or approving transmission and distribution tariffs or their methodologies.This is the first\u00a0electricity distribution tariffs report. It complements the A\u200bCER 2019 report on electricity transmission tariff methodologies.

European energy regulators (ACER and CEER) have published a set of recommendations on when and how to regulate pure hydrogen networks. The need and scope of hydrogen network regulation will depend on its structure and evolution. This paper is the first in our new series of ACER-CEER European Green Deal Regulatory White Papers. This hydrogen paper examines: The circumstances under which regulating hydrogen networks is needed;How to treat existing hydrogen network infrastructure;How to address regulatory challenges related to the repurposing of gas infrastructure for dedicated hydrogen transport. The aim is to deepen understanding on the regulatory aspects of Green Deal issues and to assist the European Commission in assessing various options as part of the preparations for legislation on hydrogen and energy system integration.What do regulators recommend on regulating hydrogen in this ACER/CEER Hydrogen White Paper?ACER-CEER consider that that when establishing the rules for the future hydrogen market, law-makers and regulators can benefit from the well-established European regulatory framework governing the natural gas and electricity markets. Furthermore, a dynamic regulatory approach might be inspired by the model of the existing EU regulation of the telecommunications sector. ACER and CEER recommend consideration of the following 6 issues when regulating hydrogen:Consider a gradual approach to the regulation of hydrogen networks in line with market and infrastructure development for hydrogenApply a dynamic regulatory approach based on periodic market analysis and monitoring Clarify the regulatory principles from the outsetForesee temporary regulatory exemptions for existing and new hydrogen infrastructure developed as business-to-business networks Value the benefits of repurposing gas assets for hydrogen transportApply cost-reflectivity to avoid cross-subsidisation between the gas and hydrogen networks in case of repurposing gas assets\u200bPure hydrogen network regulation should be introduced gradually, in line with the hydrogen market development. Periodic market monitoring at national level, based on EU-agreed principles, will identify if a pure hydrogen network is likely to become an essential facility: should that be the case, basic regulatory principles will have to apply. ACER and CEER are open to temporary regulatory exemptions, similarly to that allowed under the existing gas and electricity regulatory framework. Exemptions will allow business-to-business networks to operate without unnecessary burdens. In case the specific market circumstances evolve and regulatory exemptions would not ensure a healthy competitive environment, they should be revoked. Re-use of existing assets should be explored prior to any decommissioning. Existing gas pipelines may be repurposed to become pure hydrogen pipelines. The decision on repurposing shall be based on a case-by-case assessment, relying on cost-benefit analyses (CBAs). The CBAs will have to incorporate inputs from both the gas and hydrogen sectors and take into account societal aspects. In terms of planning the repurposing, candidate pipelines should be identified within the National Development Plans (NDPs). In case of repurposing of existing infrastructure, ACER and CEER underline the important principle of cost-reflectivity: users of each network (natural gas or hydrogen) will only pay for the network they use.\u00a0 For cost-reflectivity and to avoid cross-subsidisation when repurposed, the transfer of gas assets should be valued, as a reference, based on their residual regulated asset value.\u00a0 BackgroundThis ACER-CEER \u201cWhen and How to Regulate Hydrogen Networks?\" White Paper aims to deepen the understanding on regulating hydrogen and to assist the European Commission in assessing various options as part of the preparation for a legislation on hydrogen and energy system integration.

This ACER review is based on information provided by NRAs, and covers the methodological and project consistency between the most recent NDPs and the draft EU TYNDP 2020.What's\u200b\u200b in the ACER Review of gas NPDs?ACER's review of NDPs covers, among other \u200btopics: the certification of \u00a0Transmission System Operators (TSOs); type of unbundling models; the consultation process of the plans; the inputs used and resulting outputs; the most recent publications; and methodological aspects such as the use of network, market and sector integrated studies and cost-benefit analysis. What is new in this ACER review is an analysis of whether the energy transition aspects are covered in the gas NDPs. ACER finds that 89% of the NDPs are gas-specific, of which 75% exclude hydrogen and 4 NDPs (15%) include hydrogen.Sector-specific v's cross-sectoral network planningWhilst it is possible for NDPs to cover several energy sectors (e.g. gas, electricity, oil, heat, etc.), ACER finds that currently only 2 countries (Denmark and Spain) have cross-sectoral (electricity and gas) network development plans.National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) support gas NDPs focusing more on green and low-carbon gases, and evolving towards integrated planning with electricity in order to better align network planning with energy transition goals. Consistency of National and European gas network development plansACER has observed that the level of project consistency of national and EU-wide plans is close to 63% and varying per Member State. ACER notes a falling level of project consistency between NDPs and the present draft EU TYNDP 2020 in comparison to the two previous editions of the EU TYNDP. This decrease in project consistency is largely explained by the inclusion in the EU TYNDP 2020 of energy transition projects which are not part of most recent NDPs. ACER RecommendationsACER's Opinion leads to a number of recommendations for improving the consistency of national and European plans, among which:1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NDPs should be prepared and published in each Member State at least every 2 years.2.\u00a0 \u00a0\u200bCooperation between operators during the preparation of the NDPs regarding the development of cross-border capacities and other projects with significant cross-border impact should be improved.\u200b 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Proposed investments in NDPs and TYNDPs should carefully reflect the views of network users on the need for capacity expansions. 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Project cost data should be included in all national and EU network plans.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The sustainability dimension should be more emphasised in gas network planning, for which initiatives and legislative reforms of the network planning framework at national and EU level may be needed. Network plans should focus more on investments allowing green and low-carbon gases to be injected into the networks.The ACER Opinion and its Annexes\u200b provide comprehensive information on the most recent gas NDPs.\u00a0"}, {"id": "ACER_NEWS_0040", "date": "2020-12-18", "url": "https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER%E2%80%99s-first-70-target-report-on-the-minimum-margin-available-for-cross-zonal-electricity-trade-in-the-EU.aspx", "title": "ACER\u2019s first 70% target report on the minimum margin available for cross-zonal electricity trade in the EU", "text": " Section 1 Body Html\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bWhat is the minimum 70% cross-zonal electricity capacity target?\u200b\u200bEurope's Clean Energy Package (CEP) has set a binding minimum 70% target for electricity interconnector capacity for cross-zonal trading (the \u201cminimum 70% target\"). Why is monitoring the 'minimum 70% Target' important?The lack of sufficient cross-zonal capacity is one of the main barriers to the integration of electricity markets, and market integration is key to deliver on Europe's energy goals. The CEP established a clear rule \u2013 namely a minimum capacity margin available for cross-zonal trade (MACZT), the 'minimum 70% target', to be met by all Transmission System Operators (TSOs). The more interconnector capacity that is made available for cross-zonal trade, the more trading that can occur. The minimum 70% target is legally binding \u00a0since the start of 2020, but Member States may also adopt transitory measures, such as action plans or derogations, thus allowing TSOs to reach gradually the minimum 70% target, by the end of 2025 at the latest.ACER's monitoring aims to consistently identify the scope for improvement to meet the minimum cross-zonal capacity target, across the EU.\u00a0 How are Member States doing? Efforts needed in all countries to reach the 70% targetACER's first \u201c70% Target Report\" provides an overview of the current levels of margins for cross-zonal capacity compared to the minimum legally binding 70 % target for the first half of 2020, and on action plans and derogations.ACER's 70% Target Report finds that:Member States have much more to do to get closer to the legally binding minimum 70% target The levels of margins for cross-zonal capacity is mixed across the EU. Member States should work to meet the 70% minimum target at all times, and to reach their target national transitional targets to gradually reach the 70% minimum.How? Members States can count on several measures at their disposal to improve the level of margin offered such as cost-efficient investments; use of remedial actions; and bidding zone reconfiguration, to help them to reach the target. The levels of cross-zonal capacity are very diverse depending on the type of border and geographical location.On high-voltage Direct Current (DC) borders, the 70% target was met most of the time but with a few notable exceptions.On Alternating Current (AC) borders, there is a very diverse picture with significant room for improvement to meet the 70% target for most regions and borders.ACER's monitoring depends critically on TSOs providing robust and extensive data. \u00a0ACER acknowledges the efforts made by a majority of TSOs\u00a0to improve the provision of data. However, the completeness and quality of this data needs to be further improved. Regarding action plans and derogations, ACER finds significant room for further harmonising their setup across the EU. Regulatory authorities should grant derogations as a last resort measure, and only where necessary for maintaining operational security.For consistency, national regulatory authorities (NRAs) should consider the results of ACER's analysis to assess the compliance of TSOs with the minimum 70% target.Access to the ACER's comprehensive Report and detailed Annexes What's next?\u00a0ACER 70% target webinar: Thursday, 21 January\u00a02021\u00a0(10.00 -11.30) - Registration are now open!\u200b"}, {"id": "ACER_NEWS_0041", "date": "2020-12-17", "url": "https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/REMIT-News.aspx", "title": "REMIT News", "text": " Section 1 Body Html\u200b\u200bACER welcomes the European Commission Decision on REMIT fees due to ACER for collecting, handling, processing and analysing information reported under REMIT The European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) welcomes the European Commission Decision regulating the ACER REMIT fees.

The EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER)\u00a0and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER)\u00a0welcome the Commission's efforts to modernise the current framework (called \u201cTEN-E\") with a new focus on sustainability in the European Commission's revised TEN-E Regulation proposals, but the process needs to be robust and proper regulatory scrutiny assured.Regulators welcome the new focus on sustainability and the Green DealACER-CEER welcome the new focus on sustainability and offshore renewables including extending the scope of the Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) to include hydrogen and electrolysers. This is a big step towards the Green Deal.Room to further improve the TEN-E process and ensure regulatory oversightWelcoming the proposals, ACER Director, Christian Zinglersen stated: \u201cMassive energy infrastructure investment is needed to deliver on Europe's climate and energy priorities. Tackling infrastructure needs in an increasingly integrated European energy system is bound to be more complex, and requires a range of assets to achieve the decarbonisation targets. Regulators welcome the European Commission's efforts to make the current framework for trans-European energy infrastructure (\u201cTEN-E\") fit for purpose for the energy transition. We welcome that infrastructure \u201cscenario planning\" will become more neutral with the introduction of ACER guidelines. To reach sector integration, the scenario planning should be developed jointly for electricity and gas in a neutral way. The new process for Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) methodologies is overly complicated, and may not fit well with the agility needed for the Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP) and PCI processes which have a 2-year cycle. To ensure proper regulatory scrutiny over the ENTSO's proposals and for simple and timely processes, ACER should be given the powers to approve the methodologies for the CBA and be able to issue binding guidelines. These CBAs are critical to the reliable and consistent assessment of the TYNDP projects and the selection of the European Projects of Common Interest (PCIs). Europe's legislators should not miss this opportunity to streamline the process and improve the regulatory oversight so that the best projects are delivered.\"On the national and European network development plans, CEER President, Annegret Groebel, added: \u201cThe European regulatory framework needs to be robust for the identification of the cross-border projects and investments needed for the energy transition, and for projects funding and cost allocation to be subject to regulatory oversight by NRAs in line with the principles of the Internal Energy Market /Clean Energy Package frameworks. To ensure coherence of the TYNDP and the national level plans, national regulators should have the power to approve/amend the National Development Plans and oversight over ENTSOs on the TYNDP process needs to be strengthened. Regulators, who are closest to the projects, are best placed to decide on how to allocate the costs of cross-border energy projects in a coordinated way within ACER to support informed and consistent cross-border cost allocation (CBCA) decisions across Europe. \u00a0Regulators' recommendations on how to improve the TEN-E Regulation are set out in the ACER-CEER position paper\u200b on revision of the Trans-European Energy Networks Regulation (TEN-E) and Infrastructure Governance. \u200b\u200bAccess the full ACER-CEER Press Release\u200b."}, {"id": "ACER_NEWS_0045", "date": "2020-12-14", "url": "https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-to-decide-on-the-electricity-fallback-procedures-in-13-EU-Member-States.aspx", "title": "ACER to decide on the electricity fallback procedures in 13 EU Member States", "text": " Section 1 Body Html\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bThe National\u200b\u00a0Regulatory Authorities for energy\u00a0 in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia \u2013 the so called Core region - asked the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) to decide on their fallback procedures.Fallback procedures ensure efficient, transparent, and non-discriminatory capacity allocation in case the single day-ahead algorithm is unable to produce results on the day-ahead auction.

The objective of this consultation is to gather views and information from stakeholders on the impact of day-ahead and within-day multipliers in order to assess the possibility of publishing a recommendation to limit the level of day-ahead and within-day multipliers.The Agency invites stakeholders to provide their views on the impact of day-ahead and within-day multipliers in order to assess the possibility of publishing a recommendation to limit the level of day-ahead and within-day multipliers.ACER seeks comments of interested stakeholders on the impact of multipliers on market integration.

Compared to 2009, average electricity household prices in 2019 increased significantly, faster than inflation. The existence of regulated prices in some Member States can limit the entry of new suppliers and reduce consumer choice. Such choice will be important to enable consumers to unlock cost savings in their energy bills where possible, particularly when some of the non-contestable aspects (network, taxes, levies) may increase in the future to deliver decarbonisation.For consumers to be able to shop around for better prices and services, smart meters and reliable comparison tools are essential. However, the presence of these continues to vary across Member States, albeit with improvement in recent years. Market concentration levels continue to improve, but too slowly, with electricity markets performing better than gas markets. It is worth reflecting on the impact that COVID-19 is currently having on the energy sector, prompting a variety of responses from national regulatory authorities, mainly geared towards protecting energy supply for consumers.These are some of the findings in the latest edition of the\u00a0Energy Retail and Consumer Protection\u00a0Volum\u200be\u200b\u00a0of the annual report on the results of monitoring the internal electricity and gas markets in 2019 (MMR), published today by the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER).\u00a0The report includes two other already-published volumes analysing the electricity and gas wholesale markets. ACER and CEER develop the MMR with the support of the Energy Community Secretariat. \u00a0All volumes can be found\u00a0here.Join us for\u00a0a joint ACER/CEER webinar\u00a0to present the results of the latest MMR results at 10:30 CET on 28 October.How did retail energy prices perform in 2019?The report shows that average energy prices in 2019 increased for energy consumers, with the exception of average industrial gas prices, which recorded a decrease. The analysis also shows that the difference between wholesale and retail prices widened in 2019. A strong correlation between retail and wholesale energy prices is observed when wholesale energy prices increase. However, a weaker correlation is noted with regard to a fall in retail prices following a fall in wholesale energy prices. Such \u201csticky prices\" can result in energy consumers paying higher than needed prices for their energy consumption. While it is not expected that retail prices will always decrease at the same rate as wholesale price reductions, empowering energy consumers may assist in placing downward pressure on suppliers to decrease retail prices. How can consumers be further engaged to find the best prices?The Clean energy for all Europeans package recognises the important role that European energy consumers will play in achieving decarbonisation goals. At present, consumer engagement in retail energy markets is limited in some MS due to the presence of regulated prices. As these MS move to market-based prices, the energy consumer will have a wider choice of retail suppliers. The rate of consumers switching suppliers ranges from 1% to 20% across the EU. As regulated prices are phased out, it is expected that consumer participation will increase. However, consumers need to have the right tools allowing them to make informed decisions. For example, smart meters provide consumers with real-time information on their energy consumption, enabling their active participation in the market. However, a full smart meter roll-out has been completed only in nine MS. Meanwhile, comparison tools, which help consumers find the best offer for their needs, exist in 20 and 15 MSs for electricity and gas, respectively. The report notes that millions of complaints were filed by consumers to their suppliers (and distribution system operators, DSOs) in 2019, most often regarding invoicing issues to their suppliers and metering-related issues to their DSOs."}, {"id": "ACER_NEWS_0059", "date": "2020-10-21", "url": "https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Electricity-wholesale-markets-continue-to-integrate-in-the-EU-but-cross-border-capacity-is-limited.aspx", "title": "Electricity wholesale markets continue to integrate in the EU but cross-border capacity is limited", "text": " Section 1 Body Html\u200b\u200b\u200bElectricity price convergence in the EU increased signalling a further integration of electricity wholesale markets; however, the amount of cross-border capacity available for trade among Member States remains insufficient to meet the minimum EU target of 70%. These are some findings of the Electricity Wholesale Markets Volume of the latest report on the results of monitoring the internal electricity and gas markets (MMR) published today by the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER). The report also finds that several Member States continue to use national capacity mechanisms \u2013 policy instruments to ensure the necessary level of resource adequacy \u2013 even if they do not always face an adequacy problem. The research covers 2019, but it also includes a preliminary assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on electricity markets.\u00a0 The latest edition of the MMR consists of three volumes: Electricity Wholesale; Gas Wholesale; and a combined volume including Retail Markets and Consumer Protection, to be published on 26 October.

For example, in 2019, prices converged fully almost 50% of the time in the so-called Central-West Europe region, including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxemburg and the Netherlands. Moreover, thanks to the integration of day-ahead markets, cross-border capacity was used efficiently during all hours on more than two thirds of EU borders. On the other hand, the extension of the flow-based market coupling project to Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia in the so-called Core region has been facing recurrent delays. Accomplishing market coupling in all market timeframes across EU borders would render additional welfare benefits of more than 1.5 billion euros per year.How is COVID-19 affecting the EU electricity markets? Electricity demand dropped by 7% in the first half of 2020 compared to 2019 and prices decreased in all EU markets. Despite the pandemic, market integration continued. For example, thanks to the intraday market integration project, intraday liquidity increased by more than 25% compared to the same period of 2019. The use of renewable energy accounted for 40% of the generation mix in the EU in the first half of 2020 and for the first time surpassed the share of fossil fuels in the generation mix.Some of the main challenges: A more coordinated approach to ensure security of supply and sufficient cross-border capacityElectricity systems are facing unprecedented changes, and achieving the desired levels of security of supply at a low cost for end-consumers is essential. Capacity mechanisms remain in several Member States with a total cost of 3.9 billion euros, representing a 73% increase in 2019 compared to 2018. ACER acknowledges that these mechanisms may contribute to ensuring security of supply but recommends that Member States implement them based on a robust and coordinated resource adequacy assessment.Another remarkable challenge refers to the amount of cross-border capacity available for trade, which continues to be insufficient. ACER will soon publish a dedicated report on the issue, in view of the 70% capacity target envisaged in the Clean Energy Package (CEP), covering the first semester of 2020. The CEP offers a portfolio of instruments to achieve the 70% target. In the short term, Member States may opt for transitory measures, such as derogations or action plans, apply remedial actions like redispatching and countertrading, or improve the configuration of bidding zones. In the long term, Member States may expand or reinforce networks. In this respect, ACER is currently involved in two of these instruments. In particular, ACER is in the process of approving a number of regional methodologies for coordinated redispatching and countertrading and is assessing the methodology, assumptions and alternative bidding zone configurations to be considered for the bidding zone review.\u00a0\u200b"}, {"id": "ACER_NEWS_0060", "date": "2020-10-06", "url": "https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-consults-on-products-that-can-be-taken-into-account-in-day-ahead-coupling.aspx", "title": "ACER consults on products that can be taken into account in day-ahead coupling", "text": " Section 1 Body HtmlThe European Union (EU) Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) launc\u200b\u200bhes today a public consultation on the proposal on products that can be taken into account in day-ahead coupling made by all Nominated Electricity Market Operators (NEMOs).The proposal was made according to the EU Regulation establishing a guideline on capacity allocation and congestion management.All interested parties are invited to submit their comments by 27 October 2020.\u200bFind out more about the\u00a0Public Consultation\u200b\u200b."}, {"id": "ACER_NEWS_0061", "date": "2020-10-06", "url": "https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-consults-on-barriers-to-efficient-price-formation-and-easy-entry-and-participation-in-European-electricity-markets.aspx", "title": "ACER consults on barriers to efficient price formation and easy entry and participation in European electricity markets", "text": " Section 1 Body Html\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bIn September 2020, in the framework of the Clean Energy Package, ACER initiated a study on the efficient price formation, easy market entry and participation for new players and small actors in the European electricity markets.

The Agency also finds that these decisions have a strong link with requests for EU funding for works under the\u00a0Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)\u00a0programme\u00a0aimed at promoting growth through infrastructure.What is a CBCA Decision?\u200bBased on a cost-benefit analysis,\u00a0CBCA decisions may lead to cost sharing between countries which significantly benefit from the PCIs. For example, one or more net benefiting countries provide compensation payments to one or more\u00a0countries showing a net negative impact from the project implementation (cost bearers).

More electricity interconnections will be needed to facilitate the integration of increased renewable power generation in view of decarbonisation objectives, such as the deployment of vast offshore wind generation capacity. These developments may result not only in step-change in electricity infrastructure rollout, but also in a less territorial approach to cost allocation, especially in case many Member States become \u201ctransit countries\" as opposed to \u201coff-take countries\".In gas, retrofitted interconnections could enable a pan-European market for decarbonised gases like hydrogen and support the integration of more renewable energy. Robust and reliable cost-benefit analyses are needed to inform decision-makers on the distribution of expected benefits across borders.The\u00a0ACER-CEER Position on the Revision of the TEN-E Regulation\u00a0and infrastructure governance reflects on the use of CBCA decisions so far and contains proposals for improving the relationship between the CBCA and the CEF, among others, by reconsidering their mandatory link.\u200b\u200b"}, {"id": "ACER_NEWS_0067", "date": "2020-09-23", "url": "https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/ACER-finds-EU-gas-market-rules-successful-and-recommends-decarbonisation-to-be-built-on-current-market-design.aspx", "title": "ACER finds EU gas market rules successful and recommends decarbonisation to be built on current market design", "text": " Section 1 Body Html\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bCommon rules governing gas transportation systems have contributed over the last five years to more competition and better prices in the EU according to the\u00a0Gas\u00a0Wholesale\u00a0Volume\u200b\u200b\u00a0of the latest\u00a0Annual Report on the result\u200bs of monitoring the internal electricity and natural gas markets (MMR)\u00a0published today by the European Union Agency for the Cooperation of E\u200bnergy Regulators (ACER).

All volumes will be published\u00a0he\u200bre\u200b\u200b.\u200bThe EU gas market rules are workingGas market monitoring results show that the common rules governing access and operation of EU gas transportation systems \u2013 the Gas Network codes - have contributed to high levels of gas price integration between EU Member States, increased supply side competition and helped create liquid wholesale markets over the period of the last five years.As a result, big gas companies have less market power and more EU gas consumers can benefit from increased competition and lower prices. To safeguard these developments the Agency recommends that the adaptation of\u00a0Gas Network codes is made more dynamic, so that the market framework can be adjusted in response to evolving market conditions.\u00a0\u00a0The MMR also shows that the presence of increasingly liquid hubs and the large EU regasification and storage capacities are attracting global LNG suppliers to Europe. In an oversupplied market record LNG deliveries arriving from the Middle East, the US and Russia drove down the gas price to record lows in 2019 saving 29 billion euros according to data from the European Commission. Maintaining competition between suppliers from outside of the EU will grow in importance in the coming years as domestic gas production in Member States continues to decrease while gas consumption has been growing in recent years.Decarbonising together at EU levelNew supply of carbon neutral gas could contribute decisively to the EU climate strategy, with the added benefit of further rebalancing the current market power asymmetry between European gas buyers and third-country suppliers. However, monitoring results show that today, carbon neutral gases account for a relatively minor share of EU gas consumption at around 4%, predominantly biogas, which is mostly not injected into the gas grid, and are far from being competitive at current prices.Given the framework of The European Green Deal, particularly the increasing ambitions for reducing emissions by 2030 as well as the resources that have been earmarked for climate projects as part of the EU recovery plan, the low uptake of carbon neutral gases will need to accelerate. Therefore, the Agency recommends that any upgrading of internal gas market rules aimed at decarbonising the sector be built on foundations of the current market design, so that the transition to carbon neutral gas does not lead to market fragmentation along national borders and keeps the significant benefits for consumers in place.\u00a0The data underlying the Market Monitoring Report is available\u00a0here.\u00a0Access the\u00a0gas wholesale volume.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bImpact of COVID-19 pandemic on gas wholesale markets in the EUThe analyses in this report are mostly based on data from 2019 and do not yet fully take into account the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, preliminary analysis by the Agency shows that lockdowns which governments had enacted to control the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a severe drop of energy consumption throughout the EU. Gas demand, which fell by 8% compared to the previous year up to May 2020, has yet to return to pre-lockdown levels though demand has picked-up since the beginning of the summer.Some trends which had started in 2019 have further accelerated: EU hub prices plummeted to new record lows (in June spot prices on the reference TTF hub in the Netherlands were down by 52% compared to the previous year and 77% lower when compared to June 2018); hub trading activity, supported by additional hedging needs, rose by more than a fifth up to June 2020 compared with the same period last year; and record volumes of gas are being held in storage.\u200b\u00a0"}, {"id": "ACER_NEWS_0068", "date": "2020-09-04", "url": "https://extranet.acer.europa.eu/Media/News/Pages/Third-ACER-webinar-on-gas-transmission-tariffs.aspx", "title": "Third ACER webinar on gas transmission tariffs", "text": " Section 1 Body Html\u200bFollowing the recent publication of \u201cThe internal gas market in Europe: The role of transmission tariffs.

The legacy capacity for 2020 has been interpolated in the absence of data. *The category \u201cmore capacity open season bookings*\" includes specifically the long-term capacity allocated in 2017 via auctions in an ad-hoc open season for two interconnection points located along the routes for further transport from Nord Stream II: Lubmin II and Deutschneudorf-EUGAL. This capacity was assigned before the incremental capacity amendments to the CAM Network Code entered in place.\u00a0The trend is to book short-termSince the implementation of the EU capacity allocation mechanisms network code prescribing standardised bundled products sold through open auctions, the market trend is to book shorter-term capacity products (up to one-year ahead), with limited volumes booked for longer durations. Given the current global gas markets conditions, network users seek to pursue as much flexibility as possible, while avoiding lock-in effects. This is possible since capacity hoarding through long-term contracts has become much more difficult.This leads to a lower degree of concentration in new capacity contracts compared to legacy capacity contracts, as the former tend to attract additional market participants seeking prompt supply optimisation, thus increasing competition. However, the bookings' degree of concentration of new capacity contracts increases at some specific interconnection points and mainly for the longer-term ones. The reduced interest of EU shippers in new long-term bookings is leading to a rise in the share of upstream producers in such bookings. New long-term bookings are located in a few Member StatesThe new European long-term capacity contracts are concentrated in a few, and relatively big, interconnection points, mainly related to the Nord Stream pipelines and to the routes for further transport from there (in Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia), as shown in the chart below.\u00a0EU Member States' volumes of longer-term capacity booked from 2016 (2020 \u2013 2039) \u2013 Average TWh/day \u200b\u00a0Source: ACER calculation based on GSA, PRISMA, RBP.Notes: Volume of incremental capacity could be included in the allocated auctioned volumes. \u201cOther\" includes the other 14 MSs where CAM NC is implemented. \u201cGermany - OS\" and \u201cCzech Republic \u2013 OS\" includes specifically the long-term capacity allocated in 2017 via auctions in an ad-hoc open season for two interconnection points located along the routes for further transport from Nord Stream: Lubmin II and Deutschneudorf-EUGAL.

Contractual congestion may signal a reduction of market efficiency. It happens when some network users were not able to obtain the capacity product of their choice and had to rely on congestion-mitigating measures to access the gas market. 7th Congestion Report\u00a0Technical Annex to the 7th Congestion Report\u00a0\u200b\u200bThe report's main findings\u200bHow much congestion? \u200bIn 2019, congestion has increased compared to previous years (37 IP sides in 2019 compared to 31 IP sides in 2018).\u00a0Most congestion is due to auction premia, which primarily occurred in the auctions of quarterly capacity products.Has any progress been registered? While the number of congested IP sides remains relatively low, local contractual congestion can be severe and reduce market efficiency. About 40% of congested IP sides in 2019 have been found congested before. Much less capacity was made available via secondary capacity trading and or as interruptible capacity at congested IP sides than the amount of capacity that has been unsuccessfully requested by network users in primary auctions of firm capacity products. What comes next? Transmission System Operators ('TSOs') can apply a number of congestion management procedures ('CMPs') to ensure network users can access the network even when they could not obtain some capacity products in the primary capacity auctions. The Oversubscription mechanism remains the most applied CMP, whereas capacities made available via FDA UIOLI and Surrender mechanisms dropped significantly.About half of the congested IP sides are already covered by the FDA UIOLI mechanism, while for the other half the respective National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) need to take action in line with the European Commission's rules on congestion. ACER's main recommendations to the European Commission and to ENTSOG/TSOsThe EC may revise the CMP Guidelines to enhance the effectiveness of the measures. ENTSOG and TSOs should continue improving data reliability to ensure the accuracy of information available at the ENTSOG Transparency Platform. ACER's call on researchers\u200b\u200bThe Congestion Report has a narrow scope of analysis, while a substantial amount of congestion data is available for deeper and broader analysis. The Agency shares suggestions for further research and calls on researchers to use the substantial amount of available data to study different aspects of congestion in EU gas markets.ACER offers paid traineeship combining the onsite work experience and the possibility of contributing to the research on congestion, together with our ACER experts.

The assessment considers prices of hub traded products, declared imports and domestically produced gas.Record deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) driven by international gas market dynamics, robust pipeline imports from Russia and Norway, and gas storages that had already been well stocked at the beginning of the injection season were some of the major contributing factors to EU hub's spot prices dropping to ten years' lows in 2019. This translated into much lower sourcing costs, even in MSs that do not directly import LNG, as gas flows were directed from low to high price markets. The process has been facilitated by the market design put in place by the third energy package and further refined by gas network codes. Convergence in sourcing cost remained robust in 2019 among the majority of MSs. However, as gas prices did not fall simultaneously and to the same extent across all countries, there were some gas markets where the gap between their and the benchmark sourcing costs based on Title Transfer Facility (TTF) prices grew bigger than in recent years. This gap was largest for less integrated and diversified markets, where reliance on long-term contracts (LTCs) has remained high (prices of oil-indexed LTCs and hub prices tend to diverge in periods of hub price volatility, as the former do not necessarily respond to gas market developments).Source: ACER calculation based on Eurostat Comext, ICIS Heren and NRAs. See MMR 2015, Annex 6 for details on the general methodology and specific data used for selected MSs. Generally, the combination of marginal supply and market opportunity pricing explains the enduring sourcing cost differences between some MSs. Both are in turn affected by factors like competition, transportation costs, predominant sourcing mechanisms and market structure. Price differences may also appear between the various sourcing mechanisms within a country. These aspects will be further examined in the next edition of the Gas Wholesale volume \u200bo\u200b\u200bf the Market Monitoring Report\u200b, which will be published in September. The report will also contain the exact price estimates per MS and gas supply sourcing mechanism. Overall, in 2019 selected Central-East, South-South-East and Mediterranean MSs showed the highest prices, while most liquid Continental hubs, chiefly those more exposed to LNG, exhibited the cheapest ones.In 2020, sourcing costs are likely to again fall, with the economic slowdown caused by the Coronavirus health crises depressing energy demand and prices.

The Decision was taken by Bundesnetzagentur, Germany's National Regulatory Authority and grants the exemption for a period of four years.ACER assessed the elements of the Decision in view of the SoS Regulation and concluded that the Decision generally follows the requirements. ACER found the infrastructure standard indicators foreseen in the SoS Regulation to be already at adequate levels in Germany, in the Czech Republic and in Poland. ACER also notes the existence of available, but unexploited, permanent bi-directional capacity from the Czech Republic to Germany at the nearby Brandov virtual IP. Adding capacity from the Czech Republic to Germany in the short- to medium-term may result in considerable investment costs, which are likely to outweigh the prospective benefits for security of gas supply. ACER further notes that the request for the exemption does not include some key elements for taking a well-informed Decision: such as feasibility study, cost-benefit analysis carried out pursuant to the relevant methodology (foreseen by Regulation (EU) 347/2013), and a meaningful consultation process by the transmission system operators. The Decision could have also included options for monitoring the adequacy level of gas security of supply standards in the longer term, after two years. ACER builds its Opinion on a technical analysis of the available SoS indicators and capacities provided by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC).
