According to the EEA report, the ambition level of the European Green Deal is unprecedented. It embraces the need to address the root causes of unsustainability. However, the degree to which these ambitions have been translated into defined or quantitative targets varies. For example, the report notes that quantitative targets are lacking in the areas of circular economy and chemicals, and integrated approaches are missing for environment and health, and for making Europe's agriculture carbon neutral. Achieving Europe\u2019s sustainability ambitions requires good data and information, but important knowledge gaps remain, for example, on marine species, non-protected species and habitats, ecosystem condition, quality of materials, environmental footprints and mixtures of chemicals, the EEA report points out. Better monitoring of progress is also required in certain areas, such as the circular economy. Europe\u2019s sustainability ambitions require a transformational change in society and such change will require new types of knowledge, the EEA report says. Supporting decision-making will require going beyond filling data and information gaps and creating knowledge about the environment. It necessitates rapidly creating the wisdom about how to act appropriately \u2013 a knowledge system for sustainability transitions. \u201cWe currently understand the sustainability challenges better than we understand already available solutions and their implementation. Knowledge for action means strengthening knowledge uptake and use across society to support changes at the speed and scale needed for a sustainability transition\u201d, said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. Transformational change will not be achieved by environmental policies alone, the EEA report states. Instead, actions in fiscal, sectoral, industrial, welfare, education, employment, regional, innovation and research policies are needed and knowledge for action needs to be integrated across all of these areas and involve a wide range of stakeholders in its development.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/europes-sustainability-agenda-needs-knowledge"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0002", "date": "2021-09-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Europe\u2019s nature under pressure \u2014 challenges and solutions", "text": "The value of nature goes beyond the direct services it provides to us.

The \u2018EEA Signals\u2019 is a series of short articles based on previously published EEA data, information, and expert interviews. This year\u2019s \u2018EEA Signals\u2019 focuses the value of nature and why strong ecosystems are important for people\u2019s well-being. An article on the state of nature outlines the challenges Europe\u2019s nature is currently facing while other pieces look at the main causes behind the worrying situation and the most promising ways to allow nature to recover and flourish. James Vause, lead economist at the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), and contributor to the Dasgupta review on the economics of biodiversity, gives an interview about how accounting can help halt biodiversity loss. Dr Beate Jessel, President of the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, offers insights about the links between biodiversity and climate change, and what could be done to boost nature\u2019s resilience in a changing climate. Petr Vo\u0159\u00ed\u0161ek from the Czech Society for Ornithology, and member of the coordination team of the European Breeding Bird Atlas\u00a02, explains how data on bird populations are put together and what particular challenges Europe\u2019s bird populations face today. The EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 is Europe\u2019s long-term plan to protect nature and reverse the degradation of ecosystems.

The analysis is part of EEA\u2019s ongoing activities to assess the impacts of air pollution in Europe, and shows that, despite significant progress in reducing its environment and climate impacts, the societal costs of industrial air pollution remain high. In total, air pollution and greenhouse gases emitted from large industrial sites in Europe is estimated to have cost society between \u20ac277 and \u20ac433 billion. This is equivalent to about 2-3\u00a0% of the EU GDP and higher than many individual Member States\u2019 total economic output that year, the EEA briefing notes. A relatively small number of facilities continue to be responsible for most of the quantified external costs. Moreover, the EEA briefing shows that a relatively small number of facilities continue to be responsible for most of the quantified external costs. Just 211 sites (of the 11\u00a0655 facilities reporting emissions of the pollutants included in the E-PRTR in 2017) caused 50\u00a0% of the aggregated damage costs related to the main air pollutants and greenhouse gases.

The analysis is based on a\u00a0technical report by the EEA\u2019s European Topic Centre on Air Pollution, Transport, Noise and Industrial Pollution (ETC/ATNI), using a standard methodology, based on the so-called Impact Pathway Approach. The approach takes into account the amounts and spread of different pollutants from their industrial sources, the effects on people\u2019s health, ecosystems, climate, and farming, for example, and the associated monetary costs. The European Green Deal and zero-pollution ambition are creating an important opportunity for change.

Water retention measures, nature-based solutions and land use change measures offer multiple benefits. Overall, better and more coherent implementation\u00a0of the existing legislation\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, the Floods Directive, and the Water Framework Directive\u00a0\u2014 would reduce key pressures on water. Moreover, all water-using sectors, such as agriculture, energy, mining, aquaculture and navigation, should adopt management practices that can keep water ecosystems healthy and resilient, the EEA report states. These include farming programmes that reduce the use of pesticides, hydropower that ensures passage for fish, stringent fuel standards for navigation, and preservation of river banks. Currently, key problems include pollution from urban and industrial waste water, diffuse pollution from agriculture, and pollution from mining and dwellings that are not connected to a sewage system. Overall, 22\u00a0% of Europe\u2019s surface water bodies and 28\u00a0% of the groundwater area are significantly affected by diffuse pollution from agriculture, both by nutrients and pesticides. Deposition of air pollutants, particularly mercury, leads to the poor chemical status of Europe\u2019s water bodies. Moreover, about 34 % of surface water bodies are significantly affected by structural changes, linked to, for example, stabilising the river channel, water storage, hydropower, flood protection, or irrigation. Structural changes affect river course and flow, which can have a major impact on the river and floodplain biodiversity. Many of the structures are different types of barriers, but for about 40 % of affected water bodies the purpose of the barriers is unclear, the EEA report notes.

The EEA data show that air pollution is still a major health risk for Europeans. In central and eastern Europe, the burning of solid fuels for domestic heating and industry results in high concentrations of both fine and coarse particulate matter, as well as benzo[a]pyrene, a known carcinogen. Exposure to fine particulate matter causes cardiovascular disease, lung cancer and other diseases that lead to premature deaths. In bigger cities, high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide persist due to road traffic, with nitrogen dioxide linked to asthma and breathing problems. And, especially in southern Europe, pollutants emitted from human activities react in heat and sunlight to produce high concentrations of ground-level ozone, linked to cardiovascular disease and irritation of the eyes, nose and throat. Key results: Particulate matter (PM10):\u00a021 countries (of which 16 were EU Member States[1]) registered concentrations above the EU daily limit value in 2019, while 31 countries registered concentrations above the\u00a0stricter\u00a0World Health Organization (WHO) guideline from 2005. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5):\u00a07 countries (of which 4 were EU Member States) registered concentrations above the EU annual limit value in 2019, while 28 countries registered concentrations above the\u00a02005 WHO guideline. Ground-level ozone (O3):\u00a024 countries (of which 19 were EU Member States) registered concentrations above the EU annual limit value in 2019, while all countries registered concentrations above the\u00a02005 WHO guideline. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2):\u00a022 countries (of which 18 were EU Member States) registered concentrations above the EU annual limit value in 2019, which is the same as the 2005 WHO guideline. The EEA\u2019s data show that air quality in Europe improved in 2020, as lockdown measures to control the spread of COVID-19 led to a fall in transport emissions, combined with favorable weather patterns. An EEA analysis of the impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns on air quality in 2020 is presented in a separate briefing and more extensively in the Air Quality in Europe \u2013 2020 report. Background The WHO has established air quality guidelines to protect human health from the impacts of air pollutants. These guidelines are from 2005 and based on the best scientific evidence available at that time. WHO is expected to publish new air quality guidelines on 22 September 2021. The EU\u00b4s Ambient Air Quality Directives set maximum values for a total of 13 air pollutants. Although these values take into account relevant WHO guidelines, they also reflect the technical and economic feasibility of their attainment across EU Member States. For most air pollutants, the EU air quality standards are less strict than the WHO 2005 air quality guidelines.

New governance mechanisms and balancing experimentation and precaution can channel the potential of different types of innovation towards sustainability. Many sustainability-driven technologies promise positive outcomes, but the consequences of such innovations are difficult to anticipate, the EEA briefing points out. For example, large-scale production of first-generation biofuels resulted in deforestation and other land use changes that affected ecosystems and biodiversity. Problems arise also when improved efficiency leads to increased consumption or when technological innovations lead to lock-ins and path dependency.

Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director With 77 % of European external trade and 35 % of all trade by value between EU Member States moved by sea, maritime transport is a key part of the international supply chain. Despite a drop in shipping activity in 2020 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the sector is expected to grow strongly over the coming decades, fueled by rising demand for primary resources and container shipping. Against this background, the European Maritime Transport Environmental Report, launched today by the European Environment Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency, marks the first comprehensive health-check of the sector. The report shows that ships produce 13.5 % of all greenhouse gas emissions from transport in the EU, behind emissions from road transport (71 %) and aviation (14.4 %). Sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions from ships calling in European ports amounted to approximately 1.63 million tonnes in 2019, a figure which is expected to fall further over the coming decades due to stricter environmental rules and measures. Maritime transport is estimated to have contributed to the fact that underwater noise levels in EU waters have more than doubled between 2014 and 2019 and has been responsible for half of all non-indigenous species introduced into European seas since 1949. However, even though the volume of oil transported by sea has been steadily increasing, only eight accidental medium to large oil tanker spills out of a worldwide total of 62 occurred in EU waters over the past decade. The joint report assesses the current state of emerging maritime transport sustainability solutions, including alternative fuels, batteries and onshore power supply, and provides a comprehensive picture of their uptake in the EU. It also outlines future challenges posed by climate change for the industry, including the potential impact of rising sea levels on ports. \u201cOur Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy makes clear that all transport modes need to become more sustainable, smarter and more resilient \u2014 \u00a0including shipping. Although maritime transport has improved its environmental footprint in past years, it still faces big challenges when it comes to decarbonising and reducing pollution. Based on all the latest evidence, our policies aim to help the sector confront these challenges, by making the most of innovative solutions and digital technologies. This way, maritime transport can keep growing and delivering on our citizens\u2019 daily needs, in harmony with the environment, all the while maintaining its competitiveness and continuing to create quality jobs,\u201d said Adina V\u0103lean, EU Commissioner for Transport. \u201cThis joint report gives us an excellent overview of the present and future challenges related to maritime transport. The message is clear: maritime transport is expected to increase in the coming years and unless we act now, the sector will produce more and more greenhouse gas emissions, air pollutants and underwater noise. A smooth but rapid transition of the sector is crucial to meet the objectives of the European Green Deal and move towards carbon neutrality. This will also create new economic opportunities for the European transport industry as part of the necessary transition to a sustainable blue economy. The challenge is immense, but we have the technologies, the resources and the will to tackle it, said Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius, European Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries. \u201cInnovation-driven sustainability is an opportunity for shipping to complete a transformation on the same scale as the replacement of sails by steam. This new maritime revolution will depend on ships developed through advanced technology and digital solutions, but also on a multi-layered, fully inclusive process at national, European and international level that encompasses safety, security and social aspects as well as environmental ones. But crucial too is shipping\u2019s role as a link in a transnational logistics chain. This means that every part of that chain \u2014 \u00a0from ports to the shipbuilding sector, from shippers to the private and public financial sectors \u2014 \u00a0must be included in our drive towards sustainability,\u201d said Maja Markov\u010di\u0107 Kostelac, EMSA Executive Director. \u201cWhile Europe\u2019s maritime transport sector plays a vital role for our economic well-being, this report clearly shows that maritime transport in Europe and the entire international shipping community have an urgent responsibility to step up their efforts to reduce this sector\u2019s environmental footprint. While steps have been taken already based on European and international policies, much more is needed for a fundamental shift towards a sustainable maritime transport sector that contributes to secure the future well-being and survival of our most sensitive ecosystems and coastal areas, and the well-being of Europeans,\u201d said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. Key impacts on the environment Greenhouse gas emissions: in total, ships calling at EU and European Economic Area ports generated around 140 million tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2018 (approximately 18 % of all CO2 emissions generated by maritime transport worldwide that year). Air pollution: In 2019, sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions from ships calling in European ports amounted to around 1.63 million tonnes, approximately 16 % of the global SO2 emissions from international shipping. Underwater noise: Ships create noise which can affect marine species in different ways. It is estimated that between 2014 and 2019, the total accumulated underwater radiated noise energy more than doubled in EU waters. Container ships, passenger ships and tankers generate the highest noise energy emissions from propeller use. Non-indigenous species: Overall, since 1949, the maritime transport sector has accounted for the largest proportion of non-indigenous species introduced into seas around the EU \u2014 close to 50 % of all species, with the largest number found in the Mediterranean. A total of 51 species are all classified as high impact, meaning that they can affect ecosystems and native species. The report also notes the limited data available in assessing the full impact on habitats and species. Oil pollution: out of a total of 18 large accidental oil spills in the word since 2010, only three were located in the EU (17 %); better monitoring, enforcement and awareness is helping to reduce oil pollution events even though the amount of oil transported by sea has been steadily growing for the past 30 years. Navigating towards sustainability EU maritime transport faces a crucial decade to transition to a more economically, socially and environmentally sustainable sector. Already, most ships calling in the EU have reduced their speed by up to 20 % compared to 2008, thereby also reducing emissions, according to the report. In addition, non-traditional fuels and energy sources, such as biofuels, batteries, hydrogen or ammonia, are emerging as possible alternatives for shipping, with the potential to decarbonise the sector and lead to zero emissions. Onshore power supply (where ships shut down their engines and connect to a power source on land while berthed at port) can also provide a clean source of energy in maritime and inland navigation ports.

The EEA report assesses the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the extraction and processing of key raw materials consumed in Europe. The selected eight raw materials include copper, iron, gold, limestone and gypsum, bauxite and aluminium, timber, chemical and fertiliser minerals, and salt. Examples of climate-friendly sourcing options include adopting a life cycle approach to allow better accounting and monitoring of climate-related impacts associated with raw material supply chains, promoting resource- and energy-efficient practices, promoting use of renewable energy sources during extraction and processing of raw materials, strengthening market demand for secondary raw materials and using international frameworks for increasing transparency and cooperation along the raw material supply chains.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the EEA report, end-users\u2019 requirements for climate-friendly sourcing practices should also primarily focus on the raw material processing stage, which has greater potential for emission reductions than the extraction or trade stages.

The briefing shows that while most Member States met their respective limits in 2019, further efforts are needed to achieve the reduction commitments set for the period 2020-29 and for 2030 and onwards. Based on the latest national air pollutant inventories, all Member States respected their national emission ceilings for nitrogen oxides (NOX), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and sulphur dioxide (SO2), while four Member States \u2014 Croatia, Czechia, Ireland and Spain \u2014 exceeded their limit for ammonia (NH3). The lockdown measures implemented across Europe to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and the subsequent reduced economic activity in 2020 can be expected to have had an impact on emissions of some pollutants. The impact of the measures on emissions in 2020 will only become clear once national air pollutant inventories for 2020 are reported in mid-2022. Looking forward, nine Member States have already achieved cuts in emissions set for the period 2020-2029 for all five key pollutants, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5). However, to reach the 2030 commitments, all Member States except Estonia need to reduce their NOX emissions, 22 Member States need to reduce NH3 emissions, and 18 Member States need to reduce NMVOCs emissions. In terms of emissions of PM2.5, \u2014 the main pollutant driving premature death and disease from air pollution \u2014 EU emissions fell by 29\u00a0% from 2005 to 2019. Nevertheless, significant efforts are needed to achieve reduction commitments set for 2030 and onwards for this pollutant. In particular, three Member States \u2014 Czechia, Hungary and Romania \u2014 will need to reduce their emissions by more than 50 % and 10 Member States by more than 30 %. Changes in the energy sector will be crucial for meeting the 2020-29 and 2030 reduction commitments for PM2.5, with a focus on reducing the use of biomass and coal in residential heating needed in certain Member States. Ammonia (NH3) \u2014 mainly emitted from the agriculture sector, in particular livestock management and the use of fertilisers \u2014 also contributes to the formation of PM2.5 in the atmosphere, with further action needed to reduce emissions of NH3 from the sector. Road transport is the principal source of NOx emissions. Reporting under UNECE Air Convention Along with the EEA briefing on the NEC Directive, the EEA has also published the report European Union emission inventory report 1990-2019, which looks at air pollutant emissions reported under the UNECE Air Convention. The report shows considerable reductions in the 1990-2019 emissions of five key pollutants: carbon monoxide (CO), NH3, NOX, NMVOCs, and sulphur oxides (SOX). SOX emissions have fallen by 92 % since 1990, as a result of switching from high to low sulphur fuels, the use of emission abatement technologies and increased energy efficiency in industry and in commercial and institutional buildings and households.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/eu-as-a-whole-stays"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0012", "date": "2021-08-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Rapid shift to evolving renewable energy technologies poses new waste challenge for Europe", "text": "Introducing measures such as stronger eco-design requirements, increased emphasis on repair and upgrading, and material-specific recycling targets will address the waste and resource challenges and underpin the sustainability of renewable energy.

Increased production and consumption of masks and gloves, which have been essential to protect people\u2019s health, and certain types of food packaging resulted in additional greenhouse gas and other emissions, as well as litter that can harm ecosystems and animals. Imports of face masks and gloves into the European Union (EU) more than doubled during the first half year of the pandemic, and the EU\u2019s domestic production was also growing. The EEA briefing estimates that about 170 000 additional tonnes of face masks, or about 0.75 face masks per person per day, were imported to the EU during that period, resulting in additional greenhouse gas emissions and other types of pollution. The briefing further estimates that reusable cotton masks become more climate friendly after about 13 washes but notes that reusable masks may not provide the same level of protection, which should always be the primary consideration. The use of plastic packaging also changed during the pandemic but, instead of increasing, the EU\u2019s domestic production of plastic packaging decreased rapidly during the first months of the pandemic and then bounced back by October 2020 when restrictions were lifted in many countries, the EEA briefing shows. During the lock-downs, restaurants shifted to take-away and deliveries, increasing the use of single-use plastic food containers. However, the same lockdowns may have reduced overall sales of on-the-go snacks, reducing the need for plastic for that purpose.

The three most polluted were Nowy Sacz in Poland, Cremona in Italy and Slavonski Brod in Croatia.\u00a0 Of the 323 cities included in the viewer, air quality in 127 cities is categorised as good, meaning that it falls below the health-based guideline for long-term exposure to PM2.5 of 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air (10 \u03bcg/m3) established by the World Health Organization (WHO).\u00a0 The European Union has set an annual limit value for PM2.5 of 25 \u03bcg/m3 under policies to deliver clean air in Europe. The viewer rates the long-term air quality as very poor when PM2.5 levels are at or above this threshold, with five cities in Poland, Croatia and Italy falling in this category.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Fine particulate matter is the air pollutant with the highest impact on health in terms of premature death and disease. The viewer provides information on long term air quality in each city. Long term exposure to PM2.5 causes cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.\u00a0 While there has been a marked improvement in Europe's air quality over the past decade, the EEA\u2019s latest annual air quality assessment found that exposure to fine particulate mater caused about 417,000 premature deaths in 41 European countries in 2018.\u00a0 While air quality has improved markedly over the past years, air pollution remains stubbornly high in many cities across Europe. This city air quality viewer allows citizens to see for themselves in an easy-to-use way how their city is doing compared to others on air pollution.

Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director \u00a0 \u00a0 How the viewer works The viewer provides data on the levels of fine particulate matter in over 300 cities across EEA member countries. It uses data reported to the EEA by its member countries under the EU\u2019s Ambient Air Quality Directives. Data comes from ground measurements of PM2.5 taken by over 400 monitoring stations taken in urban and suburban areas within cities. These stations provide a robust picture of the exposure of the population to air pollution.\u00a0 Readings and rankings are based on a the annual mean PM2.5 concentration over the past two calendar years, using up-to-date data for the most recent year and validated air quality data for the year before last. The table ranks European cities according to their average levels of fine particulate matter over the past two full calendar years. The EEA will in the future investigate incorporating other important air pollutants into the new tool.\u00a0 The World Health Organization (WHO) has established a health-based guideline for long-term exposure to fine particulate matter of 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air (10 \u03bcg/m3). The European Union has set an annual limit value for fine particulate matter of 25 \u03bcg/m3 under policies to deliver clean air in Europe.\u00a0 The viewer rates levels of air quality as:\u00a0 good for levels of fine particulate matter are under the annual guideline value of the WHO of below 10 \u03bcg/m3, moderate for levels from 10 to below 15 \u03bcg/m3; poor for levels from 15 to below 25 \u03bcg/m3; and\u00a0\u00a0 very poor for levels at and above the European Union limit value of 25 \u03bcg/m3.

These include tackling the health impacts of the pandemic, dealing with the climate and ecological emergency, and addressing social and economic inequalities. The EEA briefing says that cities can become major driving forces for a green and just recovery. Infrastructure investments, which can stimulate urban economic activity after pandemic measures are eased, can be an opportunity to align the recovery with climate, environmental and social equity agendas, but will need to be accompanied by better integration of policy sectors and actions to maximise the benefits. Based on EEA work, opportunities for including environmental sustainability measures should be focused on the following sectors: urban mobility and land use, retrofitting buildings, enhancing the role of green spaces and nature-based solutions, and transforming urban food systems. No one size-fits-all approach The EEA also published a report\u2018 Urban Sustainability in Europe\u00a0\u2014\u00a0What is driving cities' environmental change\u2019, which explores work on what could make up a benchmark on how cities evaluate key drivers of and barriers to urban sustainability transitions. The EEA report is based on a survey and interviews with selected European cities. Cities are unique in many ways and, as such, transition roadmaps need to be tailor-made to local conditions. The report shows that contextual factors, together with governance, knowledge, culture, technology, data and information and finance, influence the drivers and barriers to urban transitions. Taking this into account will be increasingly important for policymakers, city planners, citizens, non-governmental organisations, academics and other actors in planning urban environmental sustainability and in implementing European Union (EU) legislation and initiatives, such as the European Green Deal, Climate law, Biodiversity strategy and the EU Urban agenda. The EEA report presents a set of 14 lessons emerging from the research, noting that flexibility will be key to enable heterogenous cities to put in place measures that work best for their own situations, that EU legislation has played a key role in accelerating change at city level, that city networks and focused partnerships have a vital role in such processes, among other relevant conclusions for cities, countries and EU policy making.

EU law has not only helped raised the overall quality, but also helped identify areas where specific action is needed.\u201d Two thirds of bathing sites are located along Europe\u2019s coasts. The results give a good indication as to where swimmers can find the best quality bathing waters. The quality of several bathing waters could not be classified in the current assessment, as pandemic restrictions led to an inadequate number of samples being collected. In 2020, 296 or 1.3 % of bathing water sites in Europe were of poor quality. While the share of poor quality sites has dropped slightly since 2013, problems persist especially in assessing the sources of pollution and putting in place integrated water management measures. At bathing sites for which the origins or causes of pollution are difficult to identify, special studies of pollution sources are needed. As part of the Zero Pollution Action Plan and in line with the Biodiversity Strategy the Commission has recently launched a review of the Bathing Water Directive. The objective is to assess whether the current rules are still fit for purpose to protect public health and improve water quality or if there is a need to improve the existing framework, notably by addressing new parameters. As a part of this process, the Commission will soon engage with the stakeholder community via an online public consultation. The findings of this year\u2019s report will be presented on 2 June at a session during EU Green Week, focusing this year on zero pollution. Alongside this year's Bathing Water Report, the EEA has also released an updated interactive map showing the performance of each bathing site. Updated country reports are also available, as well as more information on the implementation of the directive in countries. \u00a0 Background The quality of Europe's bathing water has greatly improved over the past 40 years, also thanks to the EU\u2019s Bathing Water Directive. Effective monitoring and management introduced under the Directive, combined with other EU environmental law such as the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (1991), led to a drastic reduction in untreated or partially treated municipal and industrial waste water ending up in bathing water.\u00a0As a result, an increasing number of sites have witnessed pollution reduction, leading to considerably improved water quality. The\u00a0 ongoing revision of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive is assessing how, across the EU, better action can be taken to deal consistently with sewage overflows, especially in light of climate change impacts. All EU Member States, plus Albania and Switzerland, monitor their bathing sites according to the provisions of the EU's Bathing Water Directive. The legislation specifies if the bathing water quality can be classified as 'excellent', 'good', 'sufficient' or 'poor', depending on the levels of faecal bacteria detected. Where water is classified as 'poor', EU Member States should take certain measures, such as banning bathing or advising against it, providing information to the public, and taking suitable corrective actions. \u00a0 For more information 2020 Assessment on Bathing Water Quality, including country fact sheets and interactive map Upcoming public consultation on the Bathing Water Directive EU rules on Bathing Water Quality", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/zero-pollution-vast-majority-of"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0018", "date": "2021-06-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Average car emissions kept increasing in 2019, final data show", "text": "The EEA indicator \u2018CO2 performance of new passenger cars in Europe\u2019 shows a steady decline in emissions until 2016 but, since then, average emissions of new cars have been increasing.\u00a0 In 2019, average emissions of new passenger cars registered in the European Union, Iceland, Norway and the United Kingdom (UK) were 122.3 g\u202fCO2/km.

When these removals are included, the overall reduction from 1990 to 2019 amounts to 25.9 %. Explore the EEA's greenhouse gas data viewer Almost 80 % of the net reduction in emissions achieved in 2019 took place in the heat and power sector, which is covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). Increasing carbon prices and gas becoming relatively cheaper compared with coal led to a significant reduction in coal use, in favor of gas and renewable energy sources. Emissions also decreased in other industrial sectors and residential buildings, the latter due to a warmer winter and lower demand for heating. However, CO2 emissions from the transport sector continued their increasing trend in 2019. For road transport, the increase was mostly due to higher gasoline consumption in passenger cars. During the past three decades, several factors have contributed to the EU\u2019s emission reductions, including the strong increase in the use of renewable energy, a switch from coal to gas in electricity and heat production, improvements in energy efficiency and structural changes in European economies. The decarbonisation of the EU\u2019s power sector has been the largest contributor to emission reductions since 1990. \u00a0 Note to editors The presented emission data refer to EU-27 and include international aviation emissions.

Working with nature is increasingly recognised as an efficient way to tackle these growing challenges, according the new EEA report\u00a0\u2018Nature-based solutions in Europe: Policy, knowledge and practice for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction.\u2019 The EEA report provides up-to-date information for policymakers on the how to apply nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction and at the same time making use of multiple societal benefits that these solutions can bring. Drawing on selected examples across Europe, the report shows how impacts of extreme weather and climate-related events are already tackled in this way. It also assesses global and European policies and how nature-based solutions are increasingly being integrated in the efforts to shift towards sustainable development. The EU\u2019s 2030 biodiversity strategy, a key pillar of the European Green Deal, includes a nature restoration plan that can boost the uptake of nature-based solutions. Nature-based solutions are also highlighted in the EU strategy on adaptation to climate change that was recently adopted by the European Commission. How nature can protect us Many countries are already restoring nature in river valleys and uplands to reduce downstream flooding risks. In coastal regions, natural vegetation helps to stabilise coastlines, while re-forestation is increasingly used for storing carbon. Nature is also brought back into cities by greening urban spaces or reopening old canals or rivers, which increases resilience to heatwaves and brings additional health and wellbeing benefits. Despite their increasing prominence, nature-based solutions could be mainstreamed further, the report notes. Other key findings of the report An EU-wide mapping of existing and potential nature-based solutions can help to identify priority areas for enhancing ecosystem services and addressing climate change and biodiversity loss concerns. Agreed standards, quantitative targets, measurable indicators and evaluation tools for nature-based solutions at EU level can help to assess progress, effectiveness and multiple benefits. As nature-based solutions depend on healthy ecosystems, which are themselves vulnerable to climate change, their potential for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction may decline in the future. Stakeholder involvement, dialogue and co-design of tools and measures are key to increase awareness, to resolve potential stakeholders' conflicts and to create social acceptance and demand for nature-based solutions.

The latest annual Transport and Environment Report 2020 (TERM)\u00a0addresses the issue assessing the value of travel by train and plane, amid efforts to put in place the European Union\u2019s green deal. The European Green Deal includes the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emission from transport by 90% by 2050 compared with 1990. Shifting to more sustainable transport can make an important contribution to reaching this objective. For passenger transport, a shift from air to rail travel can play a key role, the report says. \u00a0 Environmental impact of trains and planes Transport accounted for 25 % of EU greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. This sector\u2019s emissions come primarily from road transport (72 %), while marine transport and aviation represent shares of 14 % and 13 % of emissions, respectively, and rail a share of 0.4% (emissions by diesel trains only). Apart from their direct contribution to global warming and air pollution, emissions that take place during the production, transmission and distribution of energy used by trains and aircraft are also considered. Transport also causes non-exhaust emissions of air pollutants, for example from the abrasion of brakes, wheels and tyres or railway tracks. \u00a0 Train or plane? The report specifically looks into the impacts of rail and air travel, both of which are a big \u00a0part of Europe\u2019s passenger transport sector. The assessment concludes that rail travel is the best and most sensible mode of travel, apart from walking or cycling.\u00a0 Aviation\u2019s emission impacts are much higher on a passenger-kilometre basis. But the report notes that flying is not necessarily the most harmful choice. Travel by a petrol or diesel-powered car, especially if traveling alone, can be more harmful.\u00a0\u00a0 The assessment concludes that rail travel is the best and most sensible mode of travel, apart from walking or cycling. The report notes however, that over longer distances, the environmental costs of travelling by air increase less because the environmental costs of landing and take-off do not change with distance on a direct flight. The assessment is based on a comparison of travel between 20 city pairs across Europe. \u00a0 A separate EEA briefing, based on a study commissioned by the EEA also published today, says both rail and shipping are the least carbon-intensive choices for motorised transport. Rail and waterborne transport have the lowest emissions per kilometre and unit transported, while aviation and road transport emit significantly more. While the efficiency of rail and aviation improved markedly during the 5-year period covered by the study, the efficiency of other modes appears to have stagnated.

Climate change threatens to undermine the past 50 years of gains in global public health through extreme heatwaves, threats to food and water systems, and changing patterns of infectious diseases. Weather and climate extremes are already leading to fatalities and negative health effects in Europe, the briefing reminds. Moreover, vulnerability to heat extremes continues to increase in Europe, due to a growing urban population, chronic health conditions becoming more common, and an increasing number of old people. At the same time, climate change is making some areas in Europe more suitable for various infectious diseases, including dengue fever, Vibrio infections and West Nile fever.

In Europe and many other parts of the world, the quality of coastal waters, rivers and lakes generally degraded from the 19th century onwards, mainly owing to growing towns and industries discharging untreated waste water. During the 20th century, the increased use of pesticides and fertilisers on agricultural land added to this pollution. However, European environmental policy and management have dramatically improved bathing water quality across Europe during the past 40 years. Safe bathing is now possible in many European capitals, including Amsterdam, Berlin, Budapest, Copenhagen, London, Riga and Vienna, the report notes. Significant investments in urban waste water treatment plants and improvements in sewerage networks have been the key measures behind this success. EEA data show that the number of bathing sites monitored under the Bathing Water Directive has increased from about 7,500 in 1990 to more than 22,000 in 2019. From 1991 to 2019, the share of bathing sites with sufficient water quality has increased from 74 % to more than 95 % and the share of sites with excellent water quality from 53 % to 85 %. While bathing water quality in Europe is improving and today bathing is possible even in some heavily urbanised areas, there is still a need to mitigate both existing and emerging pressures. The report warns that climate change will bring new challenges for bathing water management, for example, due to rising sea levels, more frequent and stronger storms, increased river flow or water scarcity. Nutrient and chemical pollution as well as plastic pollution also remain problems that require stronger action. \u00a0 Background All EU Member States, plus Albania and Switzerland, monitor their bathing sites according to the provisions of the EU's Bathing Water Directive. The assessment of the bathing water quality under the Bathing Water Directive makes use of the values of two microbiological parameters: Intestinal enterococci and Escherichia coli. The legislation specifies if the bathing water quality can be classified as 'excellent', 'good', 'sufficient' or 'poor', depending on the levels of faecal bacteria detected. Where water is classified as 'poor', EU Member States should take certain measures, such as banning bathing or advising against it, providing information to the public, and taking suitable corrective actions. The contamination of water by faecal bacteria continues to pose a risk to human health, especially if it is found at bathing water sites. Swimming at contaminated beaches or lakes can result in illness. The major sources of pollution are sewage and water draining from farms and farmland. Such pollution increases during heavy rains and floods due to sewage overflow and polluted drainage water being washed into rivers and seas.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/europes-clean-bathing-waters"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0028", "date": "2021-02-25", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Agricultural policy needs to secure stronger environmental improvements for water in Europe", "text": "Agricultural management practices should be based on agroecological principles, organic farming and nature-based solutions, the EEA report \u2018Water and agriculture; towards sustainable solutions,\u2019 says. To achieve this, more ambitious measures to promote sustainable agriculture are needed in the upcoming EU common agricultural policy 2021-2027. Recent EEA studies have shown that many of Europe\u2019s surface and groundwaters are not in good status and the state of Europe\u2019s regional seas is alarming. Agricultural activities are an important source of pressures on Europe\u2019s waters, due to nutrient and chemical pollution, water abstraction and physical changes in habitats, including through water storage and land drainage. Responding to these challenges is urgent, since climate change impacts in parts of Europe are exacerbating pressures on water and pose a risk to agricultural production. The EEA assessment shows that a wide variety of management measures exist to tackle agricultural pressures on the water environment. While some progress has been made to reduce agricultural pressures in the 20th century, they remain at unsustainable levels with few signs of improvement over the past 10\u00a0years.\u00a0 The EEA report points to three areas of improvement: Wider uptake of sustainable management practices based on agroecological principles, organic farming and nature- based solutions. Such practices have multiple sustainability benefits, reducing pressures on water, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions, enhance the long-term resilience of agriculture to climate pressures and benefit biodiversity.

The study combines information on global climate change impacts on agricultural production with information on the EU\u2019s import profile and evidence on the vulnerability to climate change of the products\u2019 countries of origin. Risks associated to climate change are being increasingly felt across all elements of the agricultural sector from production, infrastructure and trade to finance. While Europe is mostly self-sufficient in terms of cereals and vegetables, its reliance on imported tropical products like cocoa beans or palm oil, and commodities like soy beans used for animal feed and processing make it vulnerable to climate change impacts abroad. Opening up trade with more countries with a focus on environmental protection in their agriculture policies and diversifying imports could reduce the risk of supply disruptions. Policies to reduce demand for products associated with high environmental pressures would also be beneficial in this respect.

The EEA briefing describes a process that starts by focusing on the functionalities that a product delivers in terms of the service it provides to the customer. At the next stage, product candidates should be assessed and compared for their life cycle effects, including safety, resource use and circularity, greenhouse gas emissions, and impacts on ecosystems.

The COVID-19 pandemic and climate change have amplified public attention for the plastic waste crisis we face. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director While awareness, concern and action over how we dispose of plastics in the marine environment and elsewhere have grown enormously in recent years, there are many other and less known impacts of plastics, including its contribution to climate change and new challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the EEA report \u2018Plastics, the circular economy and Europe\u2032s environment \u2014 A priority for action\u2019. The report looks at plastics production, consumption and trade, the environmental and climate impact of plastics during their life cycle and explores the transition towards a circular plastics economy through three pathways involving policymakers, industry and consumers. \u201cThe challenges posed by plastics are to a large extent due to the fact that our production and consumption systems are not sustainable. The COVID-19 pandemic and climate change have amplified public attention for the plastic waste crisis we face. It is clear that the best way is to shift to a fundamentally sustainable and circular plastics economy, where we use plastics much more wisely and better reuse and recycle them. Moreover, producing plastics from renewable raw materials should be the starting point\u201d said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. The report shows that the production, use and trade of plastics continue to grow. An increasing number of EU policies and initiatives are already in place to address the challenges posed by plastics, in particular those posed by single use plastics. In 2018, the European Commission presented the world\u2019s first comprehensive Strategy on plastics in a circular economy, which lays out the EU\u2019s approach to addressing the challenges of plastics, followed by the Single-Use Plastics Directive in 2019. The EEA report points to three pathways for the way ahead including smarter use of plastics, increased circularity, and use of renewable raw materials. Together these can help ensure we achieve a sustainable and circular plastics system. Alongside the report, two related briefings on plastics and textiles and on enabling circular business models are also published today. \u00a0 COVID-19 pandemic and plastics The coronavirus pandemic has caused changes in the production, consumption and waste of plastics. Plastic masks play a vital role in limiting the further spread of COVID-19. But the surge in plastic waste due to the demand for masks and gloves, plus changed production and use of single use plastics products like food take-away containers and plastic packaging for online sales can jeopardise EU efforts in the short term to curb plastic pollution and move to a more sustainable and circular plastics system. \u00a0 Industry\u2019s plastics production adding to climate change The consumption and production of plastics involves the use of large quantities of fossil fuels, which has negative implications for the environment and climate change. Adding to the problem, reduced economic activity has seen sharp falls in global oil prices making it significantly cheaper for manufacturers to produce plastic goods from virgin, fossil-based materials than to use recycled plastic materials. If the production and use of plastics continue to increase as projected, the plastic industry will account for 20 % of global oil use by 2050, an increase from today\u2019s 7 %. Data from the EEA\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Inventory shows that annual emissions related to plastic production in the EU amount to around 13.4 million tonnes of CO2, or about 20 % of the chemicals industry\u2019s emissions EU-wide, the report says. The economic viability of the European and global plastics recycling market is currently under significant pressure. Lower market demand for recycled plastics has also complicated the efforts of many of Europe\u2019s municipalities to manage their waste practices sustainably, and less desirable waste disposal options are being used for significant quantities of plastic waste. Figure: the environmental impacts across the life cycle of plastics Source: EEA, 2020 Synthetic textiles a growing problem A part of the plastics problem is textiles made from synthetic fibres such as polyester and nylon. According to a separate EEA briefing which looks at plastics in textiles, consumers in the EU discard about 5.8 million tonnes of textiles annually\u00a0\u2014 around 11 kilograms per person\u00a0\u2014 of which about two thirds consist of synthetic fibres. According to data available from 2017, European households consumed about 13 million tonnes of textile products (clothing, footwear and household textiles). Plastic-based textiles make up about 60 % of clothing and 70 % of household textiles. Promoting sustainable fibre choices and control of microplastic emissions, and improving separate collection, reuse and recycling, have the potential to improve the sustainability and circularity of synthetic textiles in a circular economy. \u00a0 Circular business models can help tackle the unsustainable production and consumption of plastics There are increased interest and gainful opportunities in changing traditional business models to make them more circular, enabling materials and products to be reused and to remain in the economy for as long as possible. An EEA briefing \u2018A framework for enabling circular business models in Europe,\u2019 also released today, identifies the actions that can be taken to implement circular business models effectively. It also identifies enablers to upscale them on a wide scale as part of the expected shift to a circular economy.

As such, the life cycle impact potentials were lower for eutrophication, particulate matter formation and acidification in 2018 than in 2005, while ecotoxicity- and land occupation-related impact potentials slightly increased. The briefing also shows that monitoring and targeted actions can help minimise some adverse effects of this transition, in particular those regarding freshwater ecotoxicity and land occupation. Actions should focus on reducing impacts linked to material sourcing and to production processes across various supply chains (e.g. for solar photovoltaic modules and biomass fuels), along with improvements in energy and resource efficiency. As renewable electricity projects are set to grow, assessing other potential trade-offs, such as those affecting habitats and ecosystems, will be essential to contain future impacts. Other key findings Latest data available shows that the EU-wide share of renewable energy in 2019 was less than half a percentage point lower than the binding 20 % target for 2020. At 34 % of all electricity generation, renewable electricity has almost doubled since 2005, and coal no longer supplies most of the EU\u2019s electricity. Still, fossil fuels produce more electricity altogether (38 % of all generation in 2019) than renewable sources. With combustion-based installations dominating the power mix, the EU electricity sector is responsible for almost a quarter of all EU greenhouse gas emissions. It also remains an important source of acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone formation. Fully implementing national climate and energy plans for 2030 would allow the EU to overachieve its current climate and renewable energy targets for 2030. However, such progress is still insufficient to meet a higher target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, or to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Renewable power would have to grow to over 80% by 2050 to meet these pledges. \u00a0 Background \u00a0 This briefing draws on the reports A life cycle perspective on the benefits of renewable electricity generation\u00a0 and Renewable energy in Europe 2020 \u2014 recent growth and knock-on effects.

Based on the analysis of three case studies involving six European countries, the EEA makes a series of recommendations to help overcome those challenges.

However, emissions from aviation, also covered by the ETS, continued to increase (1\u00a0%), reflecting the increasing demand for air travel in 2019. The observed reduction in emissions between 2018 and 2019 was due to the increased price of CO2, which made coal less attractive, combined with the rising share of renewables in the total energy supply. Many countries also saw a switch from coal to natural gas. In 2019 the number of EU ETS emission allowances auctioned decreased by 36 % compared to 2018. However, total revenues from auctions increased by EUR 447 million because of higher carbon prices. Continued decrease in ETS emissions forecast, but more effort needed EU countries project that their emissions under the trading system will continue to decrease in the coming decade, as per current and planned measures, albeit at a considerably slower pace than historically. However, these projections do not take into account some of the most recently planned measures, reductions already achieved in 2019 or the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u00a0 Background This EEA briefing provides an overview of past and projected emission trends under the EU ETS.

F-gases are synthetic chemicals used in everything from refrigerators, heat pumps to air conditioners and as solvents and blowing agents for foams. They are considered potent greenhouse gases and have been regulated in the EU since 2006 in an effort to reduce their use and impact on global warming. The EEA report also details the different amounts of F-gases supplied for various industrial applications. These are expressed both in physical amounts (in tonnes) and in \u2018global warming amounts\u2019, i.e. physical amounts weighted by the global warming potential of hydrofluorocarbon gases and measured in CO2-equivalent tonnes (CO2e).

The analysis is based on data on greenhouse gas emissions and energy up to 2019, officially reported in 2020, and complemented by the EEA\u2019s own preliminary estimates for missing data. The EU on track to its 2020 emission target, but national situations differ In 2019, greenhouse gas emissions in the EU-27 decreased by almost 4 %. This one-year drop was unprecedented over the last decade and occurred before the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2019 drop took place in a period of economic growth, reflecting the strong and steady growth of renewable energy in Europe and the result of cumulative long-term, sustained efforts toward lower emissions levels. Since 1990, greenhouse gas emissions in the EU have been steadily declining, with emissions in the EU-27 falling to 24 % below 1990 levels in 2019. This highlights the results of effective climate policies implemented across the EU and shows that it is clearly possible to achieve more ambitious reduction targets by 2030, paving the way for a climate neutral EU by 2050. The fast decarbonisation of the EU\u2019s power sector has been driving major and sustained emission reductions in the sectors covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). In the other sectors (transport, buildings, agriculture), the achievement by Member States of their national annual \u2018Effort Sharing\u2019 emissions targets over the period 2013-2020 has been consistent, but the overall EU-level overachievement has been narrowing. In 2019, preliminary estimates point towards 12 countries with emission levels greater than their annual targets: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czechia, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta and Poland. Renewable energy 2020 target on track Preliminary EEA data suggest that the EU-27 achieved a total share of energy consumed from renewable sources of 19.4 % in 2019. The EU is therefore on track to the 2020 target of a minimum 20 % share. While the shares of electricity, heating and cooling provided by renewables helped meet the overall EU target, reaching the target of 10 % energy needs for transport to be supplied by renewable sources by 2020 remains tenuous. The EEA\u2019s estimate for 2019 indicates that 14 Member States need to make further efforts to reach their 2020 target levels. These countries are Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. Energy efficiency: risk of not meeting 2020 targets Efforts to achieve the 2020 energy efficiency targets have not been enough. According to EEA estimates for 2019, final energy consumption in the EU-27 stabilised in 2019, but only nine Member States (Finland, Greece, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Spain) were on track toward their respective 2020 final energy efficiency targets. All other Member States need to make further efforts to curb their national energy demand and achieve their 2020 targets. Impact of COVID-19? The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 is likely to make the 2020 targets easier to achieve. While not yet quantified, there are strong indications that the economic downturn in 2020 has sharply reduced overall energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in 2020, in particular in the transport sector, with the share of energy consumed from renewable sources likely having increased. The impact of COVID-19 related potential reductions might be short-lived and emissions might rebound as economic activities return to pre-COVID levels. Reducing GHG emissions: much more work needed towards 2030, 2050 While recent trends suggest achievement or overachievement of the 2020 emissions reductions targets, remaining on track to meet the 2030 and 2050 objectives will demand sustained and long-term efforts. The latest national projections reported to the EEA, which do not yet fully reflect all national energy and climate plans, indicate a rather conservative outlook, with relatively moderate emission reductions by 2030 in the absence of new measures. Further effort will be necessary to achieve the emission reduction targets that have already been set for 2030, and even more if their ambition level is increased in line with the proposed EU climate neutrality goal by 2050. The packages of recovery measures prepared at the national and European levels provide a unique opportunity to direct short-term and long-term investments towards activities fully compatible with Europe\u2019s climate neutrality and sustainability objectives.

Policies and actions that are consistent with Europe\u2019s zero pollution ambition, lead to longer and healthier lives and more resilient societies. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The EEA\u2019s \u2018Air quality in Europe \u2014 2020 report\u2019 shows that six Member States exceeded the European Union's limit value for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in 2018: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Italy, Poland, and Romania. Only four countries in Europe\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Estonia, Finland, Iceland and Ireland\u00a0\u2014 had fine particulate matter concentrations that were below the World Health Organization's (WHO) stricter guideline values. The EEA report notes that there remains a gap between EU's legal air quality limits and WHO guidelines, an issue that the European Commission seeks to address with a revision of the EU standards under the Zero Pollution Action Plan. The new EEA analysis is based on the latest\u00a0official\u00a0air quality data from more than 4 000 monitoring stations\u00a0across Europe in 2018. Exposure to fine particulate matter caused about 417,000 premature deaths in 41 European countries in 2018, according to the EEA assessment. About 379,000 of those deaths occurred in EU-28 where 54,000 and 19,000 premature deaths were attributed to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ground-level ozone (O3), respectively. (The three figures are separate estimates and the numbers should not be added together to avoid double counting.) EU, national and local policies and emission cuts in key sectors have improved air quality across Europe, the EEA report shows. Since 2000, emissions of key air pollutants,\u00a0including nitrogen oxides (NOx), from transport have declined significantly, despite growing mobility demand and associated increase in the sector's greenhouse gas emissions. Pollutant emissions from energy supply have also seen major reductions while progress in reducing emissions from buildings and agriculture has been slow. Thanks to better air quality, around 60,000 fewer people died prematurely due to fine particulate matter pollution in 2018, compared with 2009. For nitrogen dioxide, the reduction is even greater as premature deaths have declined by about 54 % over the last decade. The continuing implementation of environmental and climate policies across Europe is a key factor behind the improvements. \u201cThe EEA\u2019s data prove that investing in better air quality is an investment for better health and productivity for all Europeans. Policies and actions that are consistent with Europe\u2019s zero pollution ambition, lead to longer and healthier lives and more resilient societies,\u201d said Hans Bruyninckx,\u00a0EEA Executive Director. \u201cIt is good news that air quality is improving thanks to the environmental and climate policies that we have been implementing. But we can\u2019t ignore the downside \u2013 the number of premature deaths in Europe due to air pollution is still far too high.\u00a0With the European Green Deal\u00a0we have set ourselves an ambition of reducing all kinds of pollution to zero. If we are to succeed and fully protect people\u2019s health and the environment, we need to cut air pollution further and align our air quality standards more closely with the recommendations of the World Health Organization. We will look at this in our upcoming Action Plan,\u201d said Virginijus\u00a0Sinkevi\u010dius,\u00a0European Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries. The European Commission has recently published a roadmap for the EU Action Plan Towards a\u00a0Zero Pollution Ambition, which is part of the European Green Deal. Air quality and COVID-19 The EEA report also contains an overview of the links between the COVID-19 pandemic and air quality. A more detailed assessment of provisional EEA data for 2020 and supporting modelling by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), confirms earlier assessments showing up to 60 % reductions of certain air pollutants in many European countries where lockdown measures were implemented in the spring of 2020. The EEA does not yet have estimates on the potential positive health impacts of the cleaner air during 2020. The report also notes that long-term exposure to air pollutants causes cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, which both have been identified as risk factors for death in COVID-19 patients. However, the causality between air pollution and severity of the COVID-19 infections is not clear and further epidemiological research is needed. \u00a0 Notes The EEA\u2019s briefing,\u00a0EEA\u2019s health risk assessments of air pollution, provides an overview of how the EEA calculates its estimates on the health impacts of poor air quality. The health impacts of exposure to air pollution are diverse, ranging from inflammation of the lungs to premature deaths. The World Health Organization is evaluating the increasing scientific evidence that links air pollution to different health impacts in order to propose new guidelines. \u00a0In the EEA\u2019s health risk assessment, mortality is selected as the health outcome that is quantified, as it is the one for which the scientific evidence is most robust. Mortality due to the long-term exposure to air pollution is estimated using two different metrics: \u201cpremature deaths\u201d and \u201cyears of life lost\u201d. These estimates provide a measure of the general impact of air pollution across a given population and, for example, the numbers cannot be assigned to specific individuals living in a specific geographical location. The health impacts are estimated separately for the three pollutants (PM2.5, NO2\u00a0and O3). These numbers cannot be added together to determine total health impacts, as this may lead to double counting of people who are exposed to high levels of more than one pollutant.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/marked-improvement-in-europes-air"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0045", "date": "2020-11-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Emerging trends: What are the environmental impacts of artificial meat, delivery drones, blockchain and synthetic biology?", "text": "The EEA has published four briefings on the implications of emerging trends for the environment and environmental policies in Europe: Artificial meat and the environment Blockchain and the environment Delivery drones and the environment Synthetic biology and the environment The briefings present the results of a horizon-scanning exercise, which drew on a range of sources to identify emerging trends of special relevance for the environment.

According to the EEA\u2019s fuel quality data indicator, the emission intensity decreased by 3.7 % between 2010 and 2018, mostly due to the increased use of biofuels. The emission intensity of fuels sold in the EU actually increased between 2017 and 2018, when considering the effects of indirect land use change due to the increased use of oil crops as feedstocks. Transport is responsible for more than 25\u00a0% of the EU\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and is a major contributor to climate change.

By 2018, the average emission intensity was 3.7\u00a0% lower than in 2010. \u00a0 More progress needed Finland and Sweden are the only Member States whose emission intensities decreased by more than 6 % according to the data. This is because their road transport fuel mixes have relatively high proportions of biofuels (8\u00a0% in Finland and 23\u00a0% in Sweden) and, on average, the biofuels used have relatively low emission intensities. The two Member States that reduced their emission intensities the least between 2010 and 2018 were Croatia (0.1\u00a0%) and Estonia (0.9\u00a0%). \u00a0 Background The EEA\u2019s fuel quality data reporting complements the annual report on the Fuel Quality Directive published by the European Commission, which was also released today.

This will benefit not only the environment, but also our society\u2019s health and well-being. The briefing, compiled from initial research by external and EEA experts, gives a preliminary view of what the Coronavirus pandemic, and resulting government measures to fight it, have meant both for our environment directly, and for EU efforts to shift to a low-carbon future. It considers what we can learn from these effects, and how they might help shape decision-making in the future. Key findings of the briefing reflect ongoing work to incorporate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic into the different areas of EEA work on the environment and European environmental policy. These topics have also been discussed in a series of high-level online debates on COVID-19 and the environment organised by the EEA. Key Findings: The COVID-19 pandemic further highlights the interrelations between our natural and societal systems: societal resilience depends on a resilient environmental support system. Biodiversity loss and intensive food systems make zoonotic diseases more likely. Often related to social inequalities, environmental factors such as air quality appear to influence COVID-19 outcomes. Increased reliance on single-use plastics and low oil prices resulting from lockdowns have negative consequences. Lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic may have some direct, short-term, positive impacts on our environment, especially in terms of emissions and air quality, although these are likely to be temporary.

These efforts need to be coupled with better implementation and enforcement of conservation policies, a focus on nature restoration, as well as increasingly ambitious climate action, especially in the transport and energy sector. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director A majority of EU wide protected species, such as the Saker Falcon and the Danube Salmon, and habitats from grasslands to dunes across Europe, face an uncertain future unless more is urgently done to reverse the situation, according to the EEA report \u201cState of nature in the EU \u2014 Results from reporting under the nature directives 2013-2018 \u201d. The EEA report is published simultaneously with the European Commission\u2019s State of Nature report, informing about the progress made in reaching the aims of the EU\u2019s nature legislation.\u00a0 \u00a0 The EEA report shows positive developments in conservation efforts. Both the number and area of sites protected under the Natura 2000 network have increased over the last 6 years and the EU met the global targets with around 18 % of its land area and nearly 10 % of marine area protected. This State of Nature assessment\u00a0is the most comprehensive health check of nature ever undertaken in the EU. Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius,\u00a0Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries However, the overall progress is not enough to achieve the aims of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020. Most protected habitats and species have either a poor or a bad conservation status and many of them continue to decline, according to the EEA assessment. Of the three main groups studied, habitats and birds lag particularly far behind while the group of non-bird species nearly met its target. Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius said: 'This State of Nature assessment\u00a0is the most comprehensive health check of nature ever undertaken in the EU. It shows very clearly that we are still losing our vital life support system. As much as 81 % of habitats at EU level are in poor condition, with peatlands, grasslands and dune habitats deteriorating the most. We urgently need to deliver on the commitments in the new EU Biodiversity Strategy to reverse this decline for the benefit of nature, people, climate and the economy.' \u00a0'Our assessment shows that safeguarding the health and resilience of Europe\u2019s nature, and people\u2019s well-being, requires fundamental changes to the way we produce and consume food, manage and use forests, and build cities. These efforts need to be coupled with better implementation and enforcement of conservation policies, a focus on nature restoration, as well as increasingly ambitious climate action, especially in the transport and energy sector,' said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. Top threats to nature Intensive agriculture, urban sprawl and unsustainable forestry activities are the top reported pressures to habitats and species, the EEA report says. Pollution of air, water and soil also impacts habitats, as does continued over-exploitation of animals through illegal harvesting and untenable hunting and fishing. These threats are compounded by alterations to rivers and lakes, such as dams and water abstraction, invasive alien species, and climate change. Abandonment of agricultural land contributes to the continued decline of semi-natural habitats, like grasslands, and their species, like butterflies and farmland birds. \u00a0 Outlook The report points to some positive developments, mostly at national or regional scale. A number of species and habitats have shown improvements, such as the Agile Frog in Sweden, coastal lagoons in France, and the Bearded Vulture at the EU level. The Natura 2000 network\u00a0shows positive effects for many species and habitats. For example, coastal and dune habitats, which are better covered by Natura 2000, have a better conservation status than habitats that are less or marginally covered. Policy-wise there is also hope due to the new EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030\u00a0and the Farm to Fork Strategy, both core elements of the European Green Deal. The biodiversity strategy aims to strengthen and enlarge the network of protected areas, set up a restoration plan and ensure that ecosystems are healthy, resilient to climate change, rich in biodiversity, and deliver the range of services essential for citizens\u2019 prosperity and well-being. Apart from these new policies, extra efforts are needed to improve monitoring capacities in Member States to support the targets. Currently, many data gaps persist, especially for marine species and habitats. More data are also needed to fully evaluate the role of Natura 2000 network. Finally, implementation of EU legislation must be significantly improved. Status and trends Around half (47 %) of the 463 bird species in the EU have good status, which is 5 % less than during the last 2008-2012 reporting period. The proportion of birds with poor or bad status has increased by 7 % in the last six years to reach a total of 39 %. At national level, around 50 % of improving population trends involve mostly wetland and marine birds for which Natura 2000 sites have been designated, such as the Ruddy Shelduck or the Black Guillemot. Breeding birds, such as the Crane and the Red Kite, have the highest share of reports showing improving population trends. This is due to the implementation of habitat protection or restoration, and improvements in knowledge, better monitoring and awareness. Only 15 % of habitat assessments have a good conservation status, with 81 % having poor or bad conservation status at EU level. Grasslands, dunes, and bog, mire and fen habitats show strong deteriorating trends while forests have the most improving trends. Compared with the previous reporting period, the share of habitats with bad conservation status has increased by 6 %. Marine regions have many assessments with unknown conservation status, reflecting the general lack of species data. Around a quarter of species have a good conservation status at EU level, which is an increase of 4 %, compared with the previous reporting period. Reptiles and vascular plants, such as the Italian Wall Lizard, the Horseshoe Whip Snake, the Hairy Agrimony, or the Great Yellow Gentian, have the highest proportion of good conservation status (35 %). Background The EU nature directives \u2014 the Habitats and Birds Directives \u2014 require conservation efforts for more than 2000 species and habitats across the EU.

This number expected to grow in coming years. Moreover, the way we plan and construct our cities remains unsustainable, the EEA report \u2018Urban adaptation in Europe: how cities and towns respond to climate change,\u2019\u00a0 says. Specifically, continued construction on floodplains, the increased covering of soil surfaces by concrete or asphalt, the small amount of green spaces, and urban sprawl encroaching on wildfire and landslide prone areas are making cities and towns much more vulnerable. The report gives the latest state of play on European climate change adaptation planning and action efforts at local level. While many local authorities have realised the importance of becoming resilient to climate change, progress in adaptation planning remains slow. Implementation of adaptation measures and the monitoring of the success of these actions are even slower. The report says that measures currently put in place mostly focus on developing knowledge, awareness raising or policy developments. Physical adaptation solutions \u2014 such as developing more green spaces to reduce the impacts of heatwaves or adjusting sewerage systems to cope with flash flooding \u2014 have not yet been implemented equally across Europe. Adaptation of cities is also necessary from an economic perspective. Urban areas are key economic hubs home to industry and services. Concerted action at all governance levels \u2014 from EU through national to local \u2014 is needed to support urban adaptation through improved access to knowledge and funding, political commitment and community engagement, and mainstreaming adaptation into all policy areas. Another EEA report, \u2018Monitoring and evaluation of national adaptation policies throughout the policy cycle,\u2019 also published today, stresses the importance of monitoring, reporting and evaluation and brings together the lessons learned on how to improve national adaptation strategies and plans in the future. The report also presents examples how indicators can play an important role in tracking progress of implementation and helping to understand the effectiveness of different approaches and measures. In addition to local and national indicators, additional European-level indicators can improve the adaptation picture across the EU. Other key findings The most pronounced impacts of climate change in European cities are likely to be caused by extreme weather, such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, flooding and droughts, but other risks \u2014 including wildfires and vector\u2011borne diseases \u2014 are also on the rise. The number of cities and towns committed to acting on adaptation to climate change has grown substantially in Europe, supported by the emphasis on urban adaptation in national adaptation strategies, EU policy and key international frameworks. Early warnings, awareness raising and nature\u2011based solutions emerge as effective and cost\u2011efficient adaptation actions. However, the success of adaptation measures is highly context\u2011dependent and the limited amount of knowledge on the success of various adaptation measures calls for improved monitoring and evaluation of the solutions implemented. The absence of a single, comprehensive overview of adaptation planning and action at the government level in Europe precludes detailed assessment of the level of preparedness for climate change in Europe. Streamlined monitoring and reporting of local adaptation plans and actions are needed if EU and national governments are to effectively support local adaptation. Financial support is key in enabling adaptation action. To measure the efficiency of the investment, necessary and planned expenditures as well as actual spending should be known. Although progress is slowly being made, much of this information is still missing today. Public finance is increasingly being directed towards climate change adaptation, but private sector finance is harder to identify. Awareness raising will be needed for this to come on stream, as private finance will be necessary to bridge the adaptation gap.

The joint study aims to improve the evaluation of the management of protected areas. According to the EEA briefing, EU Member States have so far reported on the management effectiveness of less than 8 % of protected Natura 2000 sites. This is despite the EU\u2019s and its Member States\u2019 international commitment to assess the management of 60 % of its protected areas by 2015. To demonstrate progress towards this goal, monitoring and reporting must improve considerably either through an EU-coordinated process or through compilation of national reporting, the briefing states. The EEA briefing looks at five EU Member States in more detail, showing large differences in the evaluation of protected sites\u2019 management. For example, in Finland, a national agency conducts a standardised assessment but only every 6 to 12 years for each site. France uses site steering committees while Ireland and Slovakia do not have national assessment approaches. In the Netherlands, the assessments are largely done by site managers, agricultural collectives or external consultants. The case study findings suggest that there is a need for indicators on the management and evaluation process of Natura 2000 sites. The EEA briefing shows that the lack of specific and measurable conservation objectives is a key problem for assessing the management of protected sites. Other shortcomings include the lack of established management measures, gaps in conservation data on the habitats and species the site is designated to protect, poor financial planning, and lack of public participation. The EEA briefing further says that better and more complete implementation and enforcement of the EU Birds and Habitats Directives would most likely substantially improve the management effectiveness of the EU protected areas. Other clear ways to improve the situation include more targeted capacity building, enhanced guidance, and increasing the use of available EU funding. The EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, published in May 2020, includes a specific commitment to \u201cEffectively manage all protected areas, defining clear conservation objectives and measures, and monitoring them appropriately\u201d by 2030.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/many-of-europes-protected-areas"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0056", "date": "2020-09-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Stronger joint efforts needed to achieve cleaner Mediterranean", "text": "The joint EEA and UNEP/MAP report \u2018Towards a cleaner Mediterranean Sea: a decade of progress\u2019 takes stock of the progress achieved and challenges ahead in the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) Horizon 2020 initiative for a cleaner Mediterranean (H2020). According to the report, the current interventions are effective in keeping up with increasing environmental pressures but their scale may not be enough to improve the environmental status of the Mediterranean. This main message is consistent with the findings of the \u2018State of the Environment and Development in the Mediterranean report\u2019 that will soon be released by Plan Bleu, a Regional Activity Centre of the UNEP/MAP-Barcelona Convention system. Recycling is failing to keep up with increasing waste generation in several countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, due to the relatively high cost compared with open dumping. Similarly, the report shows that access to safely managed sanitation is slowly increasing but at least 5.7 million people in urban areas and 10.6 million rural dwellers still have no access to improved sanitation systems. Another area that needs focus is the integrated management of pollution, including for example effective water reuse policies that would tackle increasing demand and decreasing availability of water. Despite efforts to transition to circular approaches, important economic sectors, such as manufacturing, are still based on linear business models relying on unsustainable resource consumption and supply chains. The report also notes the need for a more effective management of hazardous waste. Adequate funding and building capacity for the treatment and disposal of hazardous waste across the basin are both critical and urgent. One of the key challenges is that the region\u2019s complex and heterogenous policy landscape makes it difficult to address environmental challenges in a holistic way. The report calls for better enforcement of policies, which requires more robust and shared environmental information as well as capacity building at local, national and regional level. Although the regional data systems have improved significantly, there has been little improvement in data availability and quality at national level, the report indicates. \u2019Towards a cleaner Mediterranean Sea: a decade of progress\u2019 is the second joint EEA\u2013UNEP/MAP assessment under the H2020 initiative.

This reduction puts the EU emissions approximately 24 % below 1990 levels (26 % if the United Kingdom is included). EU emissions have remained consistently below the 20 % reduction target for 2020 since 2014. The downward emission trend reflects the strong and steady growth of renewable energy in Europe and the shift away from coal, triggered particularly by increased carbon emission prices. Moreover, the 2019 drop took place in a period of economic growth, highlighting the results of effective climate policies implemented across the EU. This shows that it is clearly possible to achieve more ambitious reduction targets by 2030, paving the way for a climate neutral EU by 2050. The sharp decrease in emissions in 2019 comes before the effects of the Covid-19 crisis on Europe. The EEA will publish the first detailed data on the EU's 2020 greenhouse emissions in the autumn of 2021.

In early April the EEA published a special COVID-19 air quality viewer to help assess how lockdown and related measures affected concentrations of air pollution. Online Debates The first debate \u2018A sustainable recovery \u2013 national perspectives\u2019 takes place on Wednesday,\u00a09 September from 16.30-17.30 CEST\u00a0(Copenhagen time). Dirk Messner, President of the German Environment Agency (UBA) and Hans Mommaas, Director-General of the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) will join our EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx for the discussion on this issue. To watch the event live, leave comments or questions, please go to the EEA's\u00a0Facebook page. Additional information on the event is available on the \u00a0Facebook\u00a0event page. Information on the following upcoming debates will be shared on our\u00a0debate corner. The debates will address topics such as sustainable recovery and the European green deal \u2013 the EU perspective, the scientific perspective, nature \u2013 planetary boundaries, air quality/ transport, environmental health, climate change, and strategic reflections on Europe\u2019s environment in a post-COVID world.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/new-debate-series-by-eea"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0059", "date": "2020-09-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Tackling pollution and climate change in Europe will improve health and well-being, especially for the most vulnerable", "text": "While we see improvements in the environment in Europe and a clear focus in the Green Deal on a sustainable future, the report indicates that strong action is needed to protect the most vulnerable in our society, as poverty often goes together with living in poor environmental conditions and poor health. Addressing these connections has to be part of an integrated approach towards a more inclusive and sustainable Europe Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director Improving the health and well-being of European citizens is more important than ever, with attention currently focused on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic provides a stark example of the complex links between the environment, our social systems, and our health. A significant proportion of the burden of disease in Europe continues to be attributed to environmental pollution resulting from human activity, according to the EEA report \u2018Healthy environment, healthy lives: how the environment influences health and well-being in Europe.\u2019 The report, which draws extensively on World Health Organization data on the causes of death and disease, highlights how the quality of Europe\u2019s environment plays a key role in determining our health and well-being. It shows how social deprivation, unhealthy behaviours and shifting demographics in Europe influence environmental health, with the most vulnerable hardest hit. \u2018There is a clear link between the state of the environment and the health of our population. Everyone must understand that by taking care of our planet we are not only saving ecosystems, but also lives, especially the ones who are the most vulnerable. The European Union is devoted to this approach and with the new Biodiversity Strategy, the Circular Economy Action Plan and other forthcoming initiatives we are on the path to build a more resilient and healthier Europe for European citizens and beyond,\u2019 said Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius, Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries. \u2018COVID-19 has been yet another wake-up call, making us acutely aware of the relationship between our ecosystems and our health and the need to face the facts \u2013 the way we live, consume and produce is detrimental to the climate and impacts negatively on our health. From our Farm to Fork Strategy for sustainable and healthy food to Europe\u2019s future Beating Cancer Plan, we have made a strong commitment to protect the health of our citizens and our planet,\u2019 said Stella Kyriakides, Commissioner for Health and Food Safety. \u2018While we see improvements in the environment in Europe and a clear focus in the Green Deal on a sustainable future, the report indicates that strong action is needed to protect the most vulnerable in our society, as poverty often goes together with living in poor environmental conditions and poor health. Addressing these connections has to be part of an integrated approach towards a more inclusive and sustainable Europe,\u2019 said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. Key findings Air pollution remains Europe\u2019s top environmental threat to health, with more than 400 000 premature deaths driven by air pollution every year in the EU. Noise pollution comes second, contributing to 12\u00a0000 premature deaths, followed by the impacts of climate change, notably heatwaves. The burden of pollution and climate change varies across Europe, with clear differences between countries in the east and west of Europe. The highest fraction of national deaths (27 %) is attributable to the environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the lowest in Iceland and Norway at 9 %. Socially deprived communities typically struggle under a triple burden of poverty, poor quality environments and ill health. Poorer communities are often exposed to higher levels of pollution and noise and to high temperatures, while pre-existing health conditions increase vulnerability to environmental health hazards. Targeted measures are needed to improve environmental conditions for the most vulnerable in Europe. People are exposed to multiple risks at any time, including air, water and noise pollution, and chemicals, which combine and in some cases act in unison to impact on health. European cities are particularly vulnerable to these multiple threats, while also having less access to green and blue spaces. Ongoing research is investigating the links between the current COVID-19 pandemic and environmental dimensions. The virus behind COVID-19 is thought to have \u201cjumped species\u201d from animals to humans, an unforeseen outcome of the pressure that increasing consumption places on our natural systems. Regarding the impact of COVID-19 on communities, early evidence suggests that air pollution and poverty may be linked to higher death rates. Further research is still needed to clarify these interactions, according to an initial assessment in the report. Better integration of policies, more green, blue spaces key part of solution The report stresses that an integrated approach to environment and health policies is needed to tackle environmental risks, protect the most vulnerable and fully realise the benefits that nature offers in support of health and well-being. A healthy nature is a key mechanism in the delivery of public health, reducing disease and fostering good health and well-being. Green solutions offer a triple win for health, society and the environment. Quality green and blue spaces in urban areas support health and well-being, offering venues for physical activity, relaxation and social integration, with major benefits for poor communities. Green and blue spaces cool cities during heatwaves, alleviate flood waters, reduce noise pollution and support urban biodiversity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many commentators have noted a renewed appreciation of the benefits to mental health and well-being delivered by access to green and blue space, especially in urban areas. Within the EU, the European Green Deal\u00a0represents a critical direction-setting change in the European policy agenda and sets out a sustainable and inclusive strategy to improve people's health and quality of life, care for nature, and leave no one behind.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/tackling-pollution-and-climate-change"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0060", "date": "2020-08-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Better awareness of biodegradable, compostable plastics disposal would help tackle Europe\u2019s plastics problem", "text": "The EEA briefing \u2018biodegradable and compostable plastics\u00a0\u2014\u00a0challenges and opportunities\u2019 provides an overview of plastics that often are somewhat confusingly labelled as compostable, biodegradable, oxo-degradable and/or bio-based and what the terms mean. Most plastics we use today continue to be made from fossil fuels in a process that contributes to increased greenhouse gas emissions from their production, their use, through to their disposal. Recycling rates also remain low and plastics continue to pose a threat to our environment, through littering, improper waste management, and the wear and tear of products contributing to microplastic contamination in the environment. Plastics, including their chemical additives, can stay in nature for many years and potentially enter the food chain. In the wake of growing public demand, a number of manufacturers have introduced plastics that are considered bio-based, compostable or biodegradable. However, the market share for these types of plastics is only about 1 %. Biodegradable and compostable plastics are supposed to reduce the pollution problem posed by plastics, however, they still need to be correctly disposed of, an important point often not well understood by consumers, the EEA briefing says. For example, biodegradable and compostable materials can be broken down by microorganisms into water, carbon dioxide, mineral salts and new biomass within a defined period of time. However, many consumers may not know that the conditions in home composters and in the open environment are very different compared to industrial composting plants. This affects the rate and extent of breakdown. Whether a biodegradable or compostable plastic item biodegrades, and how quickly that happens, strongly depends on the conditions it is exposed to during disposal, according to the briefing. These types of plastics can offer significant environmental benefits if they are developed for specific situations and applications, and disposed of correctly. However, such plastics are far from providing a stand-alone solution to the challenges we face with plastics. The briefing says that further improvements in their use and disposal would help make their use more effective as the market for such products is likely to grow in the years ahead. Further, in a circular economy, which the European Union is working towards through the European Green Deal, \u00a0all plastics should be recycled into new plastics as a first step.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/better-awareness-of-biodegradable-compostable"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0061", "date": "2020-08-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Europe\u2019s Eastern Partnership countries make significant progress in expanding protected nature sites", "text": "The EEA\u2019s briefing 'Protected areas in the Eastern Partnership countries'\u00a0found that between 2000 and 2019 coverage of nationally protected areas were expanded in all six partnership countries which includes Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Thanks to the European Commission\u2019s financial and Council of Europe\u2019s technical support, 561 so-called Emerald Network sites (under the Bern Convention) have been created covering just over 12 % of the Eastern Partnership countries\u2019 territories. These sites aim to support species and habitats targeted for protection under the Convention. This work has been supported by the EU under\u00a0the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) regional project on Implementing the Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS) principles and practices which has been executed by the EEA.\u00a0Throughout the duration of the partnership project, the EEA supported capacity building to improve reporting on protected areas under international obligations and indicator development for knowledge-based policy making. The EEA also provided expertise on sufficiency assessments of species and habitats in the countries proposed for inclusion in the Emerald Network. While Eastern Partnership countries have made substantial progress in overall performance over the duration of the project, more efforts are needed to improve data reporting obligations under international agreements related to biodiversity. More efforts will also be needed to improve the effectiveness of the management of protected areas as well as putting efficient monitoring programmes in place.

In all, 26 pollutants are monitored in the report sent by the EU to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). Between 2017 and 2018, emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulphur oxides (SOX), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO) and ammonia (NH3) dropped by 4.1%, 2.0%, 6.7%, 3.8%, 4.3%, and 1.6%, respectively, for the EU as a whole. Wider differences were reported by Member States, with increased emissions of certain pollutants occurring in a number of individual countries. In 2018, the residential and household sector, one of the main emitting sectors for several pollutants, emitted 61% of all polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 51% of all primary PM2.5, and 41% of all dioxins and furans to the air in the EU. As in past years, around 93% of all NH3 emissions came from agriculture. Road transport was responsible for 39% of all NOx emissions, followed by the energy production and distribution (16%) and the commercial, institutional and households (14%) sectors. Energy production and distribution which includes emissions from power plants, was also responsible for 41% of all mercury and 48% of all SOX emissions. These figures reflect emissions data for 1990-2018 and do not take the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown into account. The EU Air Convention report tracks the emissions of key air pollutants over past years. It is submitted annually by the EU to the UNECE under the requirements of the Gothenburg Protocol to the Air Convention, which aims to limit, and as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution. The protocol also sets emission limits for a range of air pollutants that have to be met from 2010 onwards and emissions reduction commitments for 2020 and beyond. The EU\u2019s National Emission reduction Commitments in the (NEC) Directive, transposes the EU obligations under the Gothenburg Protocol into EU legislation. The NEC Directive sets emission reduction commitments for five main air pollutants for 2020-2029 and more ambitious obligations for 2030 onwards. The EEA recently highlighted the latest information reported separately by Member States concerning the NEC Directive. Air pollution is the single largest environmental risk to human health in Europe, contributing to chronic and serious diseases such as asthma, cardiovascular problems and lung cancer, and shortening lifespans. Poor air quality caused by air pollution can also harm vegetation and ecosystems. Moreover, several air pollutants also contribute to climate change.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/emissions-of-most-harmful-air"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0063", "date": "2020-07-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Greater circularity in the buildings sector can lead to major cuts in greenhouse gas emissions", "text": "The EEA briefing, \u2018Cutting greenhouse gas emissions through circular economy actions in the buildings sector\u2019, says actions like reducing the use of concrete, cement and steel in the building sector can cut materials-related greenhouse gas emissions by 61% over a building\u2019s life cycle stages until 2050. \u00a0 The briefing is based on a study commissioned by the EEA, which looks at the role that specific actions towards a more circular economy can play in reducing emissions. The EEA assessment presents a new methodological approach which can help identify and prioritise circular efforts that can contribute to reducing emissions in any sector. It was developed by the EEA together with a consortium of European experts. The study found that each of a building\u2019s life cycle stages \u2014 from design, production and use to demolition and waste management \u2014 offers rich opportunity for greater circularity and emission reductions. The background study prepared for the EEA cites that up to two thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions are related to flows of materials, and how we source, consume and dispose of them. This makes it an important area for further reductions. Circular economy actions can substantially contribute to reduce these emissions. Making buildings more circular over their life cycle means designing and using them more efficiently, making them last longer, as well as reusing and recycling building materials instead of sourcing new ones. Steel, cement and concrete are some of the most emission-intensive materials used in constructing buildings. These can be cut down if the demand for such materials is reduced through smarter design and production as well as reusing and recycling these materials at the end of building\u2019s life cycle. Other actions ranging from increasing occupancy rate to improved maintenance that extends a building\u2019s lifetime also offer good potential to reduce emissions. Making the building sector more \u2018circular\u2019 by reducing demand for such materials can help the European Union meet its climate neutrality and circular economy goals under the European Green Deal. This makes such actions ideal for inclusion in EU, national and local climate change plans and roadmaps, the briefing says. \u00a0 The background study was carried out by a consortium of Ramboll consulting, Fraunhofer ISI and Ecologic Institute.

Green infrastructure networks consist of natural and man-made green structures, such as forests, parks, wildlife overpasses or hedgerows, and they are designed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services, including as water and air purification, space for recreation and climate mitigation and adaptation. According to the EEA briefing, about 80 % of the current Natura 2000 sites are already connected through natural or semi-natural areas. Around 15\u00a0% of the disconnected Natura 2000 sites are less than 1\u00a0kilometre apart but intersected by, for example, highways, agricultural land, or urban areas that limit species movement and the area\u2019s capacity to offer ecosystem services. Connecting nature sites with green infrastructure could boost ecosystem services by about 10\u00a0% within the protected network and in its surrounding areas.

The EU as\u00a0 whole (28 Member States, including then member the United Kingdom) met the 2010 emission ceilings of the four main air pollutants; nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and ammonia (NH3). While total EU emissions of ammonia emissions plateaued, five Member States (Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Ireland and Spain) exceeded their 2010 national emission ceilings for ammonia and one (Czechia) also exceeded its ceiling for NMVOCs. Ammonia emissions lead to increased acid depositions and excessive levels of nutrients in soil, rivers or lakes, damaging aquatic ecosystems as well as \u00a0forests, crops and other vegetation. NMVOCs are emitted into the atmosphere from a large number of sources, including combustion activities, solvent use and industrial production. These compounds contribute to ground level ozone, with certain NMVOCs posing risks to human health. Since 2016, all Member States have been in compliance with their national emission ceilings for nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide. The EEA briefing also assesses the reduction against 2018 emission levels required for Member States to meet their individual reduction commitments set under the EU\u2019s National Emissions reduction Commitments (NEC) Directive for 2020 and 2030. The majority of Member States must make additional efforts to reduce emission levels to meet their 2020 reduction commitments and in particular, ammonia emissions which remain a problem. The slowdown in economic activity across Europe in 2020 associated with the COVID-19 lockdowns is expected to lower emissions of several pollutants and may result in more countries meeting their 2020 commitments. However, without additional efforts, such COVID-19 related reductions might be reversed as the economy starts to recover. All EU Member States will need to reduce their NOx emissions on 2018 levels to achieve the 2030 reduction commitments. Moreover, half of the Member States will need to reduce fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions by more than 30\u00a0% to meet future commitments. Moreover, ammonia (NH3) will still remain a challenge with 25 Member States required to further lower their emissions. Efforts required by Member States to reduce their emission levels was confirmed by the NEC Implementation report recently published by the European Commission where the risk of not compliance for many Member States (based on their National Air Pollution Control Programmes and their projections) was assessed. Background The briefing\u00a0presents progress made by the EU and its Member States in meeting emissions ceilings applicable since 2010 and set out in the NEC Directive (2016/2284/EU). The EU legislation sets emission reduction commitments for four key air pollutants from 2010 onward, including NOx, NMVOCs, SO2, and NH3, and for PM2.5 from 2020 onwards. The analysis is based on the latest air pollutant emission inventory data for the period 2010-2018, as reported by EU Member States in February. The briefing also provides an assessment regarding the percentage reductions on 2018 emission levels needed for the Member States and the United Kingdom to reach their emission reduction commitments for 2020 and 2030.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/eu-met-air-pollution-limits"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0066", "date": "2020-06-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Average CO2 emissions from new cars and new vans increased again in 2019", "text": "The EEA has published the provisional data\u00a0for the average CO2 emissions from new passenger cars and vans registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the UK in 2019.\u00a0The provisional 2019 data on new registrations can be explored through a new EEA data dashboard. After a steady decline from 2010 to 2016, by almost 22 grams of CO2 per kilometre (g CO2/km), average emissions from new passenger cars increased in 2017 and in 2018 (by 2.8\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km in total). According to provisional data, the upward trend continued with an additional increase of 1.6 g\u00a0CO2/km in 2019, reaching 122.4 grams of CO2 per kilometre. This remains below the target of 130 g CO2/km that applied until 2019 but well above the EU target of 95\u00a0g CO2/km that phases-in this year. The reasons for the increase in car emissions include the growing share of the sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment. The market penetration of electric cars remained slow in 2019. Vans registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the UK in 2019 emitted on average 158.4 g CO2/km, which is 0.5 g/km more than in 2018. This remains well below the target of 175 g CO2/km that applied until 2019 but is still 11 g CO2/km higher than the EU target of 147 g CO2/km that applies from \u00a0this year on. Several factors affected this emission increase, including an increase in the average mass and only a limited increase of the\u00a0share of electric vans (BEV sand PHEV)\u00a0from 0.8 % in 2018 to 1.3% in 2019. CO2 emissions from diesel almost on par with petrol, cars becoming heavier Almost 15.5 million of new cars were registered in 2019 in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the UK. Petrol cars were the most sold passenger vehicles, constituting 59 % of all new registrations (and 63 % including hybrid electric vehicles (HEV)). Diesel vehicles constituted 31 % (32 % including HEV) of new registrations, marking a decrease of 4 percentage points from 2018, and 23 percentage points from 2011 when diesel cars peaked with a 55 % share of new registrations. On average, the CO2 emissions of diesel cars (127.0 g CO2/km) are now very close to those of petrol cars (127.6\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km). The difference of 0.6\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km was the lowest observed since the beginning of the monitoring. About 38 % of new car registrations were SUVs. Compared to other cars in the same segment, SUVs are typically heavier and have more powerful engines and larger frontal areas \u2013 all features that increase fuel consumption. The majority of new SUVs registered were powered by petrol, with average emissions of 134\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km, which is around 13\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km higher than the average emissions of other new petrol cars.\u00a0 The average mass of new cars increased by 30 kg from 2018 to 2019. The mass increase was observed for all vehicle segments (small, medium, large regular cars, and SUVs) and for both petrol and diesel cars.\u00a0\u00a0 Sales of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and battery-electric vehicles (BEV) continued to increase to about 3.5 %, compared with 2 % in 2018. About half of the BEVs were registered in Norway, Germany and the Netherlands. The combined shares of PHEV and BEV registrations were highest in Norway (56\u00a0%), Iceland (19\u00a0%), the Netherlands (16 %) and Sweden (12\u00a0%). These were also some of the few countries where the average emissions of new cars decreased from 2018 to 2019. (Non plug-in) hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) represented around 4 % of new registrations. More than 9 out of 10 newly registered vans still running on diesel 1.68 million new vans were registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and the UK in 2019. Compared with 2018, more vans were registered in Lithuania (+25.2\u00a0%), Greece (+13.7\u00a0%), Luxembourg (+7.9%) and Germany (+6.6\u00a0%) while registrations dropped in Iceland (-40.4 %), Bulgaria (-35.3\u00a0%), Malta (-17.2 %) and Spain (-17.0\u00a0%). One of the factors affecting the emission increase of 0.5 g CO2/km for new vans was the increase in the average mass of 14 kg. At the same time, the\u00a0share of electric vans (BEV sand PHEV)\u00a0remained low, although it increased from 0.8 % in 2018 to 1.3% in 2019. Diesel vehicles continue to make up the vast majority of the new van fleet, constituting 94% of registrations in 2019. The market share of petrol vans was 3.4 %, which is slightly less than in 2018. The average CO2\u00a0emissions increased for petrol fuelled new vans from 144.9 to 147.3 g\u00a0CO2/km and for diesel fuelled new vans from 160 to 161.2 g\u00a0CO2/km. The average mass increased for diesel fuelled vans by 17 kg and decreased for petrol fuelled vans vehicles 20 kg. The latter having, however, a smaller effect on the overall average mass of the vans fleet due to their low number of registrations if compared to diesel fuelled vans. The average fuel efficiency of new vans varied widely across countries due to the different models and sizes of vehicles registered. Average emissions were lowest in Cyprus (131.9 g CO2/km), Portugal (138.1 g CO2/km), Malta (140.7 g CO2/km) and Bulgaria (145.1 g\u00a0CO2/km). Average emissions were highest in Slovakia (174.3 g CO2/km), Germany (172.0\u00a0g CO2/km) and the Czech Republic (171.8 g CO2/km). The average mass of new vans registered in 2019 was 1860 kg versus 1846 in 2018. Lighter vehicles were registered in and Cyprus, Bulgaria and Portugal (average mass < 1 650 kg); heavier vans (average mass >2 000 kg) in Iceland, Slovakia, Norway and Finland. About testing vehicle emissions The emissions of new vehicles are systematically tested using \u2018type approval\u2019 procedures. Since 2017, the new Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) has been put in place, with the objective to gradually replace the outdated New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The WLTP allows to obtain more realistic information on vehicle emissions in the type approval tests. For compliance purpose, NEDC emissions values are used in 2019.

Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The current condition of Europe\u2019s seas is generally poor according to the EEA report \u2018Marine Messages II\u2019. This is bad news for people as it affects our quality of life, livelihoods and economies. The condition of our seas determines their capacity to supply, amongst others, oxygen, food, a habitable climate, and certain raw materials, and it also supports our recreation, leisure and health. Historic and current use of our seas \u2014 from the Baltic to the Mediterranean \u2014 is taking its toll, resulting in changes in the composition of marine species and habitats to changes in the seas\u2019 overall physical and chemical make-up. Added to these complex problems is climate change, which is worsening the impacts of the other threats. The combined effects of these changes are currently on a path which could cause irreversible damage to marine ecosystems, the EEA report says. There are, however, signs of marine ecosystem recovery in some areas as a result of significant, often decade-long, efforts to reduce certain impacts like those caused by contaminants, eutrophication and overfishing, the report says.\u00a0 \u201cOur seas and marine ecosystems are suffering as a result of years of severe over-exploitation and neglect. We may soon reach a point of no return, but, as our report confirms, we still have a chance to restore our marine ecosystems if we act decisively and coherently and strike a sustainable balance between the way we use of seas and our impact on the marine environment. In this context, the new EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2030 and other elements of the European Green Deal bring renewed hope that urgent and coherent action for protection and restoration will be underway,\u201d said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. EU Member States are unlikely to achieve in all their waters by 2020 the \u2018good environmental status\u2019 goal of \u00a0the EU\u2019s Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), the main EU law for marine environmental protection. Still, significant progress and achievements have been made since the Directive is in place. These conclusions are echoed by the European Commission\u2019s own report, reviewing the current state of implementation of this Directive, which is also published today. The EEA\u2019s report feeds into the Commission\u2019s review and suggests solutions that can help the EU achieve the legislation\u2019s goal of clean, healthy and productive seas, mainly through ecosystem-based management. All the data reported by EU Member States to the Commission is made public for the first time at a dedicated website on WISE-Marine, as well as data products and visualisation tools that provide an overview of the status of the marine environment in the EU. Other key findings: The EU\u2019s maritime economy continues to grow and the competition for marine resources like fish, fossil fuels, minerals or renewable energy production and space is expected to increase. This will add extra pressure on already overexploited marine ecosystems. To avoid this, the growth in this sector needs to be decoupled from the degradation and depletion of marine ecosystem and be contained within the limits for their sustainable use. Despite EU and global commitments, biodiversity loss in Europe\u2019s seas has not been halted. A high number of marine species and habitat assessments continue to show an \u2018unfavourable conservation status.\u2019 Studies point to the challenging situation species like seabirds, marine mammals (seals and whales), and fish stocks, like cod, find themselves in. Management measures targeting individual marine species and habitats have led to improvements in their condition in some EU marine regions, but this fragmented success does not offset the combined effects of multiple pressures from human activities across all of Europe's seas. Where regional cooperation has been established and implemented consistently, negative trends in certain pressures are beginning to be reversed, for example, levels of nutrients and contaminants or the introduction of non\u2010indigenous species. Land-sea interactions, as well as the significance of coastal areas, are important dimensions to consider when actions are designed to reduce pressures on the marine environment. Changes in ocean temperature and oxygen content, and ocean acidification, indicate that negative systemic changes are taking place in EU marine regions, which further reduce marine ecosystems' resilience including resilience to climate change. Past EU and regional policy implementation help identify a set of lessons for restoring marine ecosystems, which should be used when coming up with actions and solutions to achieve clean, healthy and productive seas. With political resolve, additional resources and increased coordination among stakeholders and policy integration, Europe can move towards a 'good condition' for its seas within the existing EU policy framework by 2030. To achieve this goal, pressures on marine ecosystems must to be reduced. With its ambition to protect 30 % of Europe\u2019s seas and 10 % under \u2018strict protection\u2019, the new EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2030 brings a new impetus for reducing such pressures. Achieving good condition for Europe\u2019s seas is instrumental to the Sustainable Blue Economy and maritime spatial planning objectives as reflected in the European Green Deal.

The EEA report \u2018The sustainability transition in Europe in an age of demographic and technological change\u2019 explores fiscal and financial strategies posed by an ageing European population and by the technological transition, which is neither guided by nor primarily concerned with sustainability aims. The consequences of the demographic transition may be eased by the introduction of new technologies as they can support the economy amid a shrinking working force. The EEA report says the demographic and the technological transitions could dominate not only fiscal and financial systems but may also affect European environmental policy plans meant to shift the EU to a sustainable future. The release of the EEA report follows a European Commission report on the impact of demographic change. The EU has already embarked on a path towards carbon neutrality. This involves a fundamental transformation of the food, energy and mobility systems which is a key part of the European Green Deal and its wide range of specific strategies and proposals. Both fiscal and financial policy instruments have a critical role to play in this transition\u00a0\u2014\u00a0from enabling experimentation and innovation and correcting market incentives to ensuring a fair share of the costs and benefits across society, the report finds. However, the fiscal and financial systems could potentially face significant difficulties due to the social and economic changes brought by changing demographics and new technologies. So how will this impact Europe\u2019s environmental policy targets and goals? The report builds on previous EEA work on the green economy and the sustainability transition, analysing how policymakers can better prepare for the challenges posed by demographic and technological transitions. The report highlights how these transitions have direct connections to the environment and how they have important indirect connections to sustainability strategies through the fiscal and financial systems. Key areas analysed in the report include the limits of green technologies and eco-innovation, fiscal competition among public policy areas and how this threatens the transition, and the role of sustainable finance for the transition process. An ageing population, evolving technologies, fiscal systems and the environment The ageing of Europe\u2019s population will lead to changes in the level and composition of consumption. For example, an older population is expected to consume more house- and home-related services, but less transport-related services. This will result in changes in energy consumption and emissions. An ageing EU population is also expected to have a negative effect on fiscal sustainability because it can increase the need for spending on social protection and health, while also threatening to erode the tax base through a reduced labour force. Population ageing will therefore have diverse, interrelated effects on sustainability transitions and on the public institutions that seek to navigate societal change. Gains in resource efficiency and decarbonisation of the economy are expected to arise from technological innovations especially when combined with social and policy innovations, for example, in the circular and sharing economies. However, the report cautions that there are certain drawbacks to be considered. Productivity gains could worsen labour substitution, increasing the pressure on government budgets through a shrinking tax base. This in turn affects government spending and investments. Additionally, increased artificial intelligence technology and automation, used in self-driving cars and sharing platforms, may be not as environmentally sound as expected. These emerging innovations may require large amounts of additional energy or have uncertain effects on the demand for resources. In coming decades, demographic changes as well as achieving stricter EU environmental and climate policy targets are expected to erode current tax bases. Public finances will play a major role in enabling sustainability transitions through investments in innovation, infrastructure and ecosystems but these will compete with expanding demand for spending on areas such as pensions and health. Overall, in this multiple-transition setting environment and climate actions can be seen to take up a more central position in macro-level economic, financial, fiscal and social policies. This, in turn, could enable Europe to achieve a \"just\" sustainability transition in coming decades that addresses social, economic and environmental objectives in a balanced and fair way across society.\u00a0 For a quick overview, please see the summary for policy makers.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/ageing-population-emerging-technologies-and"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0069", "date": "2020-06-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Doubling recycling across Europe is feasible, for certain waste streams", "text": "Increased recycling rates are being hindered due to economic, technical and regulatory barriers.

The briefing notes that the full implementation of measures supporting the recycling targets set under European Union legislation will help. Additionally, implementing new policy measures, some of which are included in the EU\u2019s 2020 circular economy action plan can also help increase recycling of waste materials. Recycled amounts from municipal, construction and electronic waste have increased over past years. Landmark EU directives, such as the Waste Framework Directive (WFD) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive, have fuelled the increase. These laws follow principles designed to achieve a gradual, but steady, increase in the level of recycling of a waste stream compared with the amount generated. For example, the existing municipal waste recycling target for 2035 aims to exploit much of the waste stream\u2019s recycling potential.

Cleaner bathing waters do not only benefit our own health and well-being but also the health of the environment. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The results published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Commission\u00a0give a good indication where swimmers can find the best quality bathing waters. However, due to the coronavirus outbreak and restrictive measures put in place across Europe, members of the public are advised to seek updated information from local and national authorities and beach operators about safety measures at bathing sites. To help Member States gradually lift travel restrictions and allow tourism businesses to reopen, after months of lockdown, while respecting necessary health precautions the Commission presented on 13 May a package of guidelines and recommendations. Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius, Commissioner in charge of the Environment, Fisheries and Oceans, said, \u201cClean bathing water is usually taken as something that is gifted, but it\u2019s actually one of the European collective achievements. It\u2019s the result of hard work by many people over many years. This year\u2019s report once again confirms that European citizens can continue to enjoy very high quality standards when bathing in European waters and all measures must be taken to continue along this path.\u201d Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \"Regular monitoring and assessment of bathing water are essential for ensuring that we maintain the already very high quality across Europe and, where needed, we take effective measures to address water pollution.

Albania and Switzerland also monitored and reported on the quality of their bathing water sites and their data are included in the assessment. Specific results showed only minor drops in sites meeting the highest \u2018excellent\u2019 standards, and the minimum \u2018sufficient\u2019 quality requirements set out in the EU\u2019s Bathing Water\u00a0Directive. \u2018Excellent\u2019 quality bathing water sites across Europe stood at 85 %. Those meeting the least minimum \u2018sufficient\u2019 standing stood at 95 %. The briefing also found that the quality of coastal swimming sites is better than those located inland. The number of overall 'poor' rated sites stood at 1.3 % of all sites monitored in Europe last year. That figure has not fluctuated much since 2013, when the figure stood at 2 %, reflecting the long-term improvements in bathing water quality in Europe. Europe's bathing water quality has vastly improved over the last 40 years, when the EU's Bathing Water Directive was introduced. Effective monitoring and management introduced under the directive, combined with other EU environmental legislation such as the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (1991), led to a drastic reduction in untreated or partially treated municipal and industrial waste water ending up in bathing water.\u00a0As a result, more and more sites are not only meeting the minimum quality standards but have also improved their quality to the highest standards. Alongside this year's report, the EEA has also released an updated interactive map\u00a0showing the performance of each bathing site. Updated country reports\u00a0are also available, as well as more information on the implementation of the directive in countries. The Commission intends to launch an evaluation of the directive in the coming weeks with the intention to analyse what has worked and not. On that basis, the Commission will decide whether additional initiatives should be taken to improve the functioning of the directive.

The majority of them were newly identified and did not have complete sets of samples yet. \u00a0 Background All EU Member States, plus Albania and Switzerland, monitor their bathing sites according to the provisions of the EU's Bathing Water Directive. The assessment of the bathing water quality under the Bathing Water Directive makes use of the values of two microbiological parameters: Intestinal enterococci and Escherichia coli. The legislation specifies if the bathing water quality can be classified as 'excellent', 'good', 'sufficient' or 'poor', depending on the levels of faecal bacteria detected. Where water is classified as 'poor', EU Member States should take certain measures, such as banning bathing or advising against it, providing information to the public, and taking suitable corrective actions. The contamination of water by faecal bacteria continues to pose a risk to human health, especially if it is found at bathing water sites. Swimming at contaminated beaches or lakes can result in illness. The major sources of pollution are sewage and water draining from farms and farmland. Such pollution increases during heavy rains and floods due to sewage overflow and polluted drainage water being washed into rivers and seas.\u00a0 \u00a0 For more information European bathing water briefing Bathing water country reports Interactive bathing water map Overview of all bathing water products", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/quality-of-europes-bathing-waters"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0073", "date": "2020-06-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "New cars and vans sold in 2018 more CO2 intensive, final data confirms", "text": "According to the EEA report \u2018Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2018\u2019, emissions from new cars registered in the EU, the UK and Iceland in 2018 increased mainly due to the growing share of petrol cars in new registrations, in particular in the sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment, and the limited market uptake of zero\u2010 and low\u2010emission vehicles, including electric cars. The 2018 data on new registrations can be explored through a new EEA data dashboard. After a steady decline from 2010 to 2016, by almost 22 g\u00a0CO2/km, average emissions from new cars increased by 0.4 g\u00a0CO2/km in 2017 and by 2.3 g\u00a0CO2/km in 2018 to reach 120.8 g CO2/km. While this is 7\u00a0% below the 2018 target of 130 g\u00a0CO2/km, a considerable 27\u00a0% gap must still be filled to reach the target of 95 g\u00a0CO2/km that applies from 2020 on. Similarly, average emissions of new vans had decreased by 24\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km between 2012 and 2017, but increased from 156.1 g\u00a0CO2/km in 2017 to 157.9 g\u00a0CO2/km in 2018. While this is 10\u00a0% below the 2018 target of 175 g\u00a0CO2/km, average emissions were still 7\u00a0% above the 2020 target. Many factors affected the increase in CO2 emissions from new vans in 2018, including an increase in the mass, engine capacity and size of the vehicles. The market share of petrol vans increased but remained limited, constituting 3.6 % of the new fleet (2.4% in 2017). The share of zero- and low-emission vans remained stable, at 1.7 % of the fleet.\u00a0 Only one car manufacturer missed its 2018 emission targets All manufacturers, except one, met their specific CO2 emission targets in 2018 but were still far away from their 2020 targets. Automobili Lamborghini SPA exceeded its specific emission targets for 2018 and is therefore required to pay excess emission premiums. Amongst the large manufacturers, Toyota is the closest to reaching its future targets, with an estimated distance to the 2020 target of around 5 g\u00a0CO2/km, while Mazda Corporations the furthest, with a distance to 2020 target of 39 g\u00a0CO2/km. All van manufacturers met their specific CO2 emission targets in 2018, taking into account pools and derogations. Some of the largest van makers, including Automobile Peugeot, Automobile Citroe\u0308n, Ford\u2010Werke GmbH and Iveco, have already achieved average specific CO2\u00a0emissions below their 2020 target level. Other manufacturers, including Nissan International, Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Europe, are also very close to their 2020 targets. Electric vehicles and smaller engines to improve manufacturers\u2019 performance Since 2010, the officially reported average CO2 emissions of new passenger cars have decreased substantially. These reductions can be attributed to both the overall improvement of car energy efficiency, as well as a change in the mix of car models sold, towards more efficient powertrains and technologies. Engine downsizing and the uptake of electric vehicles have had a positive effect on reducing CO2 emissions but the growing share of SUVs has systematically led to an increase in emissions. The \u2018de-dieselisation\u2019 of the fleet has increased average emissions but its overall effect on each car manufacturer\u2019s performance depends on the fleet characteristic of the manufacturer. Testing vehicle emissions The emissions of new vehicles are systematically tested using \u2018type approval\u2019 procedures. Since 2017, the new Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) has been put in place, gradually replacing the outdated New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The WLTP allows to obtain more realistic information on vehicle emissions in the type approval tests. In 2018, Member States reported both NEDC and WLTP emission factors for around 4.4 million cars (around 30\u00a0% of new registrations). For those vehicles, the WLTP emission factor was on average 20\u00a0% higher than the NEDC emission factor. EEA activities The EEA collects and regularly makes available data on new passenger cars and new vans registered in Europe, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 631/2019. The data reported by all EU Member States, the UK and Iceland in order to evaluate the efficiency of the new vehicle fleet includes information on CO2 emissions and vehicle mass. The data reported by Iceland were included for the first time. In 2020, the EEA will collect, also for the first time, data on CO2 emissions from heavy duty vehicles (trucks).

The EEA report \u2018Trends and drivers of EU greenhouse gas emissions\u2019 analyses the development in these data from 1990 to 2018. Total greenhouse gas emissions in the EU stood at 4\u00a0392 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2018, which is 23.2 % lower than in 1990. Over the same period, average emissions per EU citizen decreased from 12.2 tonnes CO2e to 8.9 tonnes CO2e. The EU reduction without the UK was 20.7\u00a0%. 12.2 tonnes CO2e per EU citizen in 1990 8.9 tonnes CO2e per EU citizen in 2018 Two thirds of the 2018 emission reduction took place in the heat and power sector, where emissions from coal burning decreased by almost 50 million tonnes and the use of renewables in electricity generation continued to grow. After four consecutive years of increases, emissions from road transport remained stable in 2018, compared with 2017. The EEA analysis shows that the carbon intensity of the EU economy has more than halved over the past three decades. For each Euro generated in the economy, the EU emitted 277 grams of CO2 in 2018, compared with 582 g CO2 per Euro in 1990. Emissions have decreased in almost all economic sectors, especially in energy supply, industry and the residential sector. In the transport sector, emissions have increased due to higher demand and despite climate policies and efforts to improve vehicles efficiency. \"The EEA data show that cutting greenhouse gas emissions does not need to harm the economy. To the contrary, Europe\u2019s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic calls for ambitious and sustainable investments that can rebuild our economy and contribute to a fair transition towards a climate-neutral Europe by 2050, thus creating the competitive jobs for the future. Strong mitigation to avoid the worst effects of climate change remains an absolute priority\", said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. Several factors have contributed to the emission reductions in the EU, the EEA report notes. These include EU and country-specific policies, the increase in the use of renewable energy, switching from coal to gas, improvements in energy efficiency, structural changes in European economies from industry towards services, temporary effects of economic recessions, and on average milder winters since 1990. \u00a0 Note to editors The analysis in this report does not yet take into account the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It also shines light on their potential implications for major policy processes such as the European Green Deal (EGD) in the EU and the UN Agenda 2030 and Sustainable Development Goals. The report argues that varying global and European trends point not only to continuing sustainability challenges and new risks, but also towards opportunities for positive change. For example, new technology might save resources and alleviate environmental pressures but it can also lead to increasing demand for energy and natural resources. As such, achieving sustainability goals requires a transformation of Europe\u2019s core systems of production and consumption through policies like the EGD as well as wider changes in norms and priorities across all levels of society. The complexity of known trends together with the emergence of new developments in an increasingly interconnected world point to the value of recognising the presence of deep uncertainties around future developments and the need to act differently, the EEA report states. For Europe, responding to existing challenges and new risks calls for more anticipatory governance and engaging with actors across society, for example through strategic foresight processes. The EEA report points out that emerging developments with unknown implications can range from new security threats to changing values and more digital lifestyles. Another category of drivers of change are \u2018wild cards\u2019 that may seem unlikely but can bring about highly disruptive changes, such as the dramatic decline in pollinators that could threaten global food supply.

The first question is how to define a \u2018safe operating space\u2019 for Europe where all humanity can continue to develop and thrive. The second question is whether Europe\u2019s consumption, or environmental footprint, is currently smaller or larger than its estimated \u2018safe operating space\u2019. The report acknowledges that there are different ways to allocate Europe\u2019s operating space in the global context, which inevitably involve normative choices about fairness, equity, international burden sharing, sovereignty and the right for development. Based on these different allocation principles, the study arrives to a minimum European share of 2.7 %, a maximum share of 21 %, and a median share of 7.3 % of the global limits. Using a consumption-based analysis for four of the Earths life support systems, the report shows that Europe currently exceeds its safe operating space for nitrogen cycle by a factor of 3.3; phosphorous cycle by a factor of 2.0, and land system change by a factor of 1.8. Conversely, Europe does live within its limits when it comes to freshwater use, although problems with overconsumption and water scarcity remain locally and regionally.

The report notes that since 2016 there has been a noticeable shift in the focus of policies from improving resource efficiency to a broader circular economy perspective. Many aspects of the two overlap in policies, such as waste management and waste prevention, along with environmental and sustainable development strategies, innovation policies and economic programmes. The shift in focus is expected to consolidate even further as wider EU action is currently underway in this area, especially with the EU\u2019s newly adopted Circular Economy Action Plan, which is one of the key parts of the\u00a0 European Green Deal. Indicators, targets and monitoring The report\u2019s survey found that in past years there was a general lack of target setting across Europe, which is needed to improve resource efficiency and drive the circular economy. In their surveys, countries noted that adopting national targets is often politically difficult. The survey also found that universally accepted indicators, that would coherently address the different aspects of the circular economy, would help improve both the adoption and use of targets in this area as well as informing a more comprehensive monitoring system. The report highlights the widely different approaches and levels of advancement among the countries surveyed. While policies on resource efficiency, raw material supply and the circular economy have different focuses, the report notes that all three are strongly related and mutually supported. Resource efficiency and raw material supply addresses the links between nature and Europe\u2019s socio-economic system, while the circular economy addresses the socio-economic system itself. Background The report is based on the third survey the EEA has conducted since 2011 looking at national policy responses in Eionet member countries. While the scope of these surveys has evolved over the years along with the policy agenda, together they provide \u00a0timely information on continuities, differences and new trends and what these mean for the development of policies on resource efficiency and the circular economy in Europe.

The EEA has received many questions about the impacts of the stark measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) on air quality in Europe. The EEA\u2019s data show an accurate picture of the drop in air pollution, especially due to reduced traffic in cities. However, addressing long-term air quality problems requires ambitious policies and forward-looking investments. As such, the current crisis and its multiple impacts on our society work against what we are trying to achieve, which is a just and well-managed transition towards a resilient and sustainable society. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The EEA\u2019s data for recent weeks show how concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a pollutant mainly emitted by road transport, have decreased in many Italian cities. For example: In Milan, average concentrations of NO2 for the past four weeks have been at least 24 % lower than four weeks earlier this year. The average concentration during the week of 16-22 March was 21 % lower than for the same week in 2019. In Bergamo, there has been a constant decline in NO2 pollution over the past four weeks. The average concentration during the week of 16-22 March was 47 % lower than for the same week in 2019. In Rome, average NO2 concentrations for the past four weeks were 26-35 % lower than for the same weeks in 2019. Similar trends can be seen in other European cities where lockdown measures have been implemented during the week of 16-22 March. In Barcelona, average NO2 levels went down by 40 % from one week to the next. Compared with the same week in 2019, the reduction was 55 %. In Madrid, average NO2 levels went down by 56 % from one week to the next. Compared with the same week in 2019, the reduction was 41 %. In Lisbon, average NO2 levels went down by 40 % from one week to the next. Compared with the same week in 2019, the reduction was 51 %. Exposure to air pollution can lead to adverse health effects, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. A number of health authorities have warned that those citizens with certain pre-existing conditions, such as respiratory illnesses, may have an increased vulnerability to COVID-19. \u00a0However at present it is not clear whether ongoing exposure to air pollution might worsen the condition of those infected by the virus. Further epidemiological research is needed to address such questions.\u00a0 About the methodology The weekly average concentration levels of air pollutants were calculated based on data from the EEA\u2019s up-to-date air quality data system. All daily mean values from the stations in each city have been considered for the average. Other factors than the lockdown measures, such as weather conditions, can also have an effect on weekly variations of the pollutant concentrations. Background The EEA monitors Europe\u2019s air quality through a network of more than 4,000 local air pollution measurement stations across Europe. Most of the stations, managed by the EEA\u2019s member countries in the European Environment Information and Observation Network (Eionet), record hourly data on key air pollutant concentrations and send it to the EEA. The European Air Quality Index\u00a0uses the monitoring data to allow users to understand more about air quality where they live, work or travel. Displaying up-to-date information for Europe, users can gain insights into the air quality in individual countries, regions and cities. Similar air quality information can be found on the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) that provides daily analyses of hourly concentrations of the regulatory air pollutants.

The report also briefly explains how these devices work, summarises their reliability, and highlights the potential of such devices to address questions about air quality. The EEA report shows that citizen science initiatives can produce useful information about local air quality. Such information can be used, for example, to improve official air quality models used to estimate pollution levels and identify suitable actions to improve air quality. The initiatives often also help to raise public awareness of air quality problems, which can lead to stronger public measures to address the issue or changes in personal behaviour, such as switching from driving to walking or cycling. However, the various types of measuring devices each have different benefits and disadvantages and users should be aware of their limitations, the EEA report cautions. Although some devices are relatively reliable, low-costs sensors can for example, be sensitive to weather conditions or lack the capacity to measure very high or very low pollutant concentrations. In the near future, the increasing number of citizen science initiatives focused on air pollution, coupled with new data digitalisation approaches, may represent a paradigm shift in the way that air quality is monitored, the EEA report states. A large network of low-cost sensors, combined with statistical analysis or machine learning, could complement the quality of the current official data and provide new pathways to obtain accurate, real-time information. Background The EU Air Quality Directives require every Member State to establish a network of air quality monitoring stations in accordance with a set of criteria. These criteria specify both technical requirements for instruments and the types of locations where stations should be situated, including at traffic, industrial, urban, suburban and rural sites. These provisions aim to ensure that measurements are representative for a defined area and ensure the delivery of harmonised, comparable air quality data across Europe. Although emissions of air pollutants have decreased substantially in Europe over recent decades, poor air quality continues to harm human health and the environment.

According to the EEA briefing, EU Member States and the United Kingdom (UK) have reduced greenhouse gas emissions in Effort Sharing sectors by 11 % from 2005 to 2018.[2] If Member\u00a0States and the UK\u00a0were to fully implement their existing and planned policies and\u00a0measures, as reported under the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation in March 2019, the Effort Sharing emissions could further decrease by 2030 to a level 27 % below that of 2005. Nonetheless, the annual pace of emission cuts needs to nearly double from 2018 onward, in order to achieve the EU Effort Sharing target of 30 % reduction from 2005 to to 2030. The effort sharing target is part of the EU\u2019s commitment of reducing all greenhouse gas emissions at least by 40\u00a0% from 1990 to 2030. Heating and cooling in residential and commercial buildings delivered about half of the reductions in Effort Sharing emissions from 2005 to 2018. Improving energy efficiency and switching to cleaner heating and cooling fuels, including renewable energy sources, helped make these cuts, the EEA briefing states. Emission reductions in this sector are expected to continue. Conversely, transport and agriculture sectors delivered very limited emission cuts between 2005 and 2018.\u00a0Transport and agriculture cover together about half of all Effort Sharing emissions. Transport emissions have increased every year since 2014 due to a growing demand for passenger and freight transport. Member States expect large future reductions in transport emissions, but these reductions mostly rely on measures that are still to be adopted and fully implemented. Worryingly, current projections indicate that EU Member States plan rather low reductions in emissions from the agriculture sector by 2030. Continued monitoring and evaluation of effects of emission reduction measures is clearly needed. This will help identify the most effective measures to achieve climate neutrality in the EU. About the briefing The new EEA briefing[1] builds on the Agency\u2019s recent Trends and Projections report, which assesses progress towards the EU\u2019s climate and energy targets, and a briefing on national policies and measures for climate change mitigation. The findings are based on preliminary estimates of greenhouse gas emissions for 2018 and historic and projected greenhouse gas emissions, as well as a database of policies and measures that Member States reported to the EEA in March 2019 under the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation. The work also relies on the results of two detailed assessments of trends in the Effort Sharing sectors carried out by the European Topic Centre (ETC) for the EEA in 2017 and 2018.

Rail, aircraft and industry round up the other top sources of environmental noise pollution. The report provides an update of noise pollution trends over the 2012-2017 period. It also provides an outlook of future noise projections as well as the associated health impacts in Europe, based on new World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on the health effects from exposure to noise. Building on the previous EEA assessment of noise in Europe from 2014, the report also looks at actions being taken to manage and reduce noise exposure and reviews progress made to meet the EU objectives on noise pollution set by EU legislation, including the Environmental Noise Directive and the EU\u2019s 7th Environmental Action Programme (EAP). An estimated 113 million people are affected by long-term day-evening-night traffic noise levels of at least 55 decibels (dB(A)). In most European countries, more than 50 % of inhabitants within urban areas are exposed to road noise levels of 55 dB or higher during the day-evening-night period.\u00a0According to the World Health Organization, health impacts are likely to occur at this level. The EU considers long-term exposure to noise levels over 55 decibels as high. Significant health impacts Long-term exposure to noise has significant health impacts. On the basis of the new WHO information, the EEA estimates that such exposure causes 12,000 premature deaths and contributes to 48,000 new cases of ischemic heart disease (caused by a narrowing of heart arteries) per year across Europe. It is also estimated that 22 million people suffer chronic high annoyance and 6.5 million people suffer chronic high sleep disturbance. According to World Health Organization evidence, these health impacts start to occur below the reporting thresholds set by the EU Noise Directive and so are likely to be underestimated. In addition, the information provided by countries under the EU directive does not cover all urban areas, roads, railways and airports. 22 million people are exposed to high levels of railway noise, 4 million to high levels of aircraft noise and less than 1 million to high levels of noise caused by industries. Apart from affecting humans, noise pollution is also a growing threat to wildlife both on land and in water. Noise can reduce reproductive success and increase mortality and the fleeing of animals to quieter areas. EU objective for 2020 on noise will not be achieved While some progress has been made by EU Member States in mapping and reporting more areas of high noise across Europe, overall policy objectives on environmental noise have not yet been achieved. Notably, the objective set for 2020 by the 7th Environmental Action Programme of decreasing noise pollution and moving towards the WHO recommended levels for noise exposure will not be achieved. Noise pollution is projected to increase because of future urban growth and increased demand for mobility. More than 30 % of data required under the EU directive is still not available after the legally set 2017 reporting deadline. Significant delays suggest that countries may not have taken the necessary steps to address noise pollution. The report adds that better implementation is also required \u2014 a point reinforcing the conclusions of a separate recent European Commission assessment on the implementation of the directive. Actions to reduce noise levels Countries are already taking a variety of actions to reduce and manage noise levels, however, it remains difficult to evaluate their benefits in terms of positive health outcomes, the EEA report says. Examples of the most popular measures to reduce noise levels in cities include replacing older paved roads with smoother asphalt, better management of traffic flows and reducing speed limits to 30 kilometres per hour. There are also measures aimed at raising awareness and changing people\u2019s behavior in using less-noisy modes of transport like cycling, walking or electric vehicles. A significant number of countries, cities and regions have also put in place so-called quiet areas, most of which are parks and other green spaces, where people can go to escape city noise. The report says more needs to be done to create and protect quiet areas outside of the city and improve accessibility of these areas in cities. Background on the EU\u2019s Environmental Noise Directive People\u2019s exposure to noise is monitored under the Environmental Noise Directive (END) against two reporting thresholds; an indicator for the day, evening and night period (Lden) that measures exposure to noise levels associated with \u2018annoyance\u2019 and an indicator for night periods (Lnight) that is designed to assess sleep disturbance. These reporting thresholds are higher than the WHO recommended values and currently, there is no mechanism in place for tracking progress against the latter lower values. \u00a0 More information on the Environmental Noise Directive Access data through The NOISE Observation & Information Service for Europe Noise country fact sheets", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/number-of-europeans-exposed-to"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0084", "date": "2020-03-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Healthy floodplains have a key role to play in improving our environment", "text": "A more ecosystem-based approach to the management of floodplains would help to conserve and restore biodiversity and reduce chemical and nutrient pollution in rivers, lakes and wetlands, and increase water retention according to the EEA report \u2018Floodplains: a natural system to preserve and restore.\u2019 Such an approach would recognise the multiple functions floodplains play. Natural, undisturbed floodplains are under increased pressure from human development, putting at risk the unique environmental roles they play during flood cycles. The report points to studies that show that up to 90 % of floodplains have been environmentally degraded as a result of structural flood protection, river straightening, disconnection of floodplain wetlands, agricultural land use and urbanisation over the past two centuries. This degradation has put floodplains in a poor position to adequately provide important ecosystem services that could otherwise handle the increased risk of flooding due to climate change, as well as improve water and biodiversity status. While historical changes have supported economic growth and flood protection, they have had serious environmental consequences. Urban and agricultural development of floodplains together with structural flood protection have contributed greatly to disconnecting rivers from their floodplains, reducing their critical roles in flood and drought mitigation, as habitats, and in water quality protection. These changes have also made today\u2019s floods more damaging. Floods remain one of the most costly natural disasters. The report highlights that floodplain restoration \u2014 focused on nature based solutions and an ecosystem management approach \u2014 has the potential to greatly increase the role these areas can play in achieving positive environmental benefits, while also reducing the negative impacts of floods. Further, floodplains that are maintained in their natural condition would support objectives under existing European Union legislation, including the Water Framework, Floods, Birds and Habitats Directives. Restoring and preserving floodplains can also support the objectives of the European Green Deal, including climate change, tackling biodiversity loss and eliminating pollution. Background Floodplains cover 7 % of Europe\u2019s total area and up to 30 % of protected Natura2000 sites. While they are home to multiple protected species and habitats, they are also home to 12 % of Europe\u2019s population and many of Europe\u2019s cities. For example, more than 25 % of the population in Liechtenstein, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Netherlands and Slovakia live in floodplain areas. Important ecosystem services they provide include natural water retention, carbon sequestration, water purification, habitats and biodiversity and recreation. In degraded floodplains, the quality of these services is reduced. Presently only 17% of Europe\u2019s protected habitats associated with floodplains achieve good conservation station, and 40% of Europe\u2019s water bodies achieve good ecological status.\u00a0 Enhancing the ecosystem services provided by floodplains could improve these results.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/healthy-floodplains-have-a-key"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0085", "date": "2020-02-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Why does Europe need to limit climate change and adapt to its impacts?", "text": "The increased exposure to climate related hazards will differ from region to region across Europe, according to the EEA story map (download as pdf )The background briefing shows examples of selected risks across Europe. It stresses the important role of limiting climate change to avoid the worst impacts as well as the key role of adaptation and resilience amid new EU plans under the European Green Deal to present for a new, more ambitious EU adaptation strategy. EEA assessments, including the recently published Europe\u2019s state of the environment and outlook (SOER) 2020 report, point to a worsening of climate change in the future, even if global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions prove effective. Extreme weather and climate-related events that result in hazards such as floods, droughts, forest fires and extreme sea level will become more frequent and intense in many regions. This will lead to adverse impacts on ecosystems, economic sectors and human health and well-being. \u00a0Climate change impacts will also affect the urban areas in Europe. For example, low-lying cities in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and along the northern Italian coastlines, in particular Venice, are among the cities most exposed to coastal flooding in Europe due to a combination of sea level rise and storm surges. All of these impacts make adaptation to the impacts of climate change crucial. Adaptation must be tailored to the specific regional and local circumstances, including the climate hazards faced there and other regional and local aspects. Key issues highlighted Droughts: Existing studies project large increases in the frequency, duration and severity of drought in most of Europe over the coming century, except for northern Europe. The greatest increase in drought conditions is projected for southern Europe, where it will increase competition between water users, such as agriculture, industry, tourism and households. Heavy rain and floods: Climate change is projected to lead to a higher intensity of rain, with projections showing an increase of heavy rain in most parts of Europe in autumn and winter by up to 35 % by the end of 21st century in a high emissions scenario. Forest fires: Large forest fires in recent years have affected several regions in northern and western Europe where fires had not been prevalent in the past. The relative increase in fire danger is projected to be particularly large in western-central Europe, but the absolute fire danger remains highest in southern Europe. Sea-level rise and coastal flooding: All coastal regions in Europe have experienced an increase in absolute sea level but with significant regional variations. Sea-level rise, in combination with storm surges, substantially increases the flooding risk in low-lying coastal regions in the coming decades. Coastal flooding is threatening coastal ecosystems, water resources, settlements, infrastructure and human lives. The severity of such impacts depends on current coastal flood protection, which varies across the various low-lying coastal regions in Europe. While the impacts of climate change can no longer be avoided, their magnitude depends on the success of global and European efforts to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases, as mandated by the Paris Agreement and planned for under the European Green Deal.

The portal was launched at the\u00a0International Conference on forests for biodiversity and climate\u00a0(4-5 February 2020)\u00a0in Brussels, Belgium.\u00a0 \u201cThe European Environment Agency is pleased to play its part in the creation of this important new knowledge tool. FISE will help us to improve the health and resilience of our forests, which play a vital role in protecting our biodiversity and in mitigating climate change,\u201d said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. Forests face increased pressures Forests and other wooded land cover more than 40 % of Europe, making it one of the most forest-rich regions in the world. In addition to providing lumber and wood products, our forests are home to many ecosystems, which have multiple functions and are home to a major part of Europe\u2019s biodiversity. Their ecosystem services contribute to our health and well-being. Forests also act as an important stopgap to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Although forests are increasingly seen as a major carbon sink, current management practices to increase this function are not always in line with the needs to ensure high biodiversity in woodland ecosystems. In addition to an increased demand for forest-based products like timber, forests and their ecosystems continue to face air and water pollution, urban sprawl, landscape fragmentation, habitat and biodiversity loss. Moreover, the impacts of climate change, which has led to more fires, pests and extreme weather, including droughts and storms, are putting forests under increased pressure. A growing number of EU and national policies draw on, or affect directly and indirectly, Europe\u2019s forests, including their ecosystems. Forests are addressed across a range of environment, climate and sectoral policies in the EU and also features in the European Green Deal. Forestsalso impact many policy areas meant to use forest resources sustainably and protect biodiversity, ecosystems, species and habitats. Work on FISE will be phased up over the coming years and will cover five priority themes for forest information on forest basic data (cover and types, species), bioeconomy, nature and biodiversity, climate change mitigation and forest health and resilience. FISE partnership The Forest Information System for Europe is a partnership between the European Commission services and the EEA, drawing on the preparatory work already done by the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre (JRC). The EEA will manage the FISE web portal and will collect and analyse the data coming from national data centres via the European Environment Information and Observation Network, in collaboration with the JRC.

It looks at the progress made under both the ongoing EU-wide phase-down of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and the global HFC phase-down, which began in 2019 under the so-called Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. F-gases are synthetic chemicals used in everything from refrigerators, heat pumps to air conditioners. The EEA report also details the different amounts of F-gases supplied for various industrial applications. These are expressed both in physical amounts (in tonnes) and in \u2018global warming amounts\u2019, i.e. physical amounts weighted by the global warming potential of hydrofluorocarbon gases and measured in CO2-equivalent tonnes (CO2e). Phase-down under the EU F-Gas Regulation As F-gases contribute to climate change, phasing-down their use has become an important part of the EU\u2019s strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and become climate neutral. The F-gas Regulation aims at cutting the EU\u2019s F-gas emissions by two-thirds by 2030 compared with 2014 levels. The phase-down in the EU is being done through a system of annual quotas allocated to producers and importers. In 2018, the EU-wide quantity of HFCs placed on the market stayed below the overall market limit for the third year in a row, by 1%. EU contribution to global phase-down The EU\u2019s HFC 'consumption' in 2018, as defined under the Montreal Protocol, was 46\u00a0% below the first limit set for the EU for 2019 under the Montreal Protocol\u2019s Kigali Amendment. Other key findings: In addition to reduced use and imports, a substitution is taking place in favour of less climate-harming F-gases: The volume of total supply of F-gases in the EU was 14 % lower in 2018 than in 2017, and the overall warming effect decreased by 30 % (CO2e). Refrigeration and air conditioning continue to be key applications. Total imports of F-gases to the EU in 2018 decreased by 7 % compared with 2017 (25 % if measured in CO2e). Most of this decrease is due to lower HFC imports, and the remainder is caused by decreases in imports of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). Fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions have been decreasing in the EU since 2015, after 15 years of uninterrupted annual increases. In 2017, total fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 2\u00a0%. \u00a0 Related content Interactive chartsEEA greenhouse gas \u2013 data viewer", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/the-eu-continues-to-phase"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0088", "date": "2020-02-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Walking, cycling and public transport in cities remain greener mobility options than electric scooters or car ride-hailing", "text": "This year\u2019s transport and environment report \u2018The first and last mile \u2014 the key to sustainable urban transport\u2019 assesses how green and sustainable \u2018first and last mile\u2019 transport options like bicycles, scooters or other means of short distance travel can transform mobility systems in cities. The report also assesses how innovative urban freight and inner city delivery services, including the use of delivery drones, can make urban freight transport more sustainable. Short start or end journeys are an essential part of the daily commute. Bus, rail and metro services often cover the main part of trips to and from work, but people still need to first walk, drive or use another way to get to and from the nearest station or stop. Better first-mile, last-mile or only-mile journeys have the potential to bring down car use \u2014 reducing traffic congestion, emissions and improving air quality. Cities can do a lot to facilitate access to public transport systems by creating attractive urban spaces that are well connected to public transport infrastructure and by making walking and cycling to and from hubs and stops easier and more pleasant. Shifting to walking, cycling and public transport will be crucial if Europe is to meet its long-term sustainability goals and policy objectives under the European Green Deal\u00a0proposed by the European Commission in December 2019. Digitalisation and mobility apps can make a good urban mobility system even better, but they cannot compensate for underdeveloped public transport, the report cautions. For green options to have a fair chance to compete with cars, prices also need to reflect the harm done to health and environment. Not all mobility options are equally green Taken together with public transport, walking and cycling for short city journeys provide the greatest benefits for both human health and the environment in urban areas. The introduction and rapid uptake of app-based vehicle sharing schemes can also have benefits, however, the report points to studies which show that their impact on the environment is not always positive. Especially e-scooter sharing schemes appear to attract users that would have otherwise walked or used public transport. While the use of shared e-scooters generates few direct environmental impacts, their green credentials can be questioned by the substantial negative impacts associated to their materials, their manufacturing and their frequent collection for recharging purposes. Similarly, studies show that ride-hailing apps like Uber or Lyft do little to reduce emissions or congestion and actually draw people away from public transport. Increasing transport emissions hamper EU progress towards environment and climate objectives The transport sector continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels and is responsible for one quarter of Europe\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The sector is also a significant source of air pollution, especially of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as well as the main source of environmental noise in Europe. The EEA briefing tracks the short- and long-term environmental performance of the transport sector in the EU. Transport emissions were 29 % above 1990 levels in 2018.\u00a0According to the European Green Deal proposal, transport emissions need to be cut by 90 % by 2050 to achieve climate neutrality in the EU.\u00a0 Other key findings: In 2018, average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of new passenger cars increased for the second consecutive year, reaching 120.4 g\u00a0CO2 per kilometre. Petrol cars are overtaking diesel-fuelled cars in sales of new passenger cars, but the total consumption of diesel fuel keeps increasing. Average CO2 emissions of new vans started to follow a similar upward trend in 2018. Greenhouse gas emissions from aviation increased the most rapidly of the transport modes \u2014 by an average of over 3 % each year since 2013. Greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping increased by 5 % in 2 years (2015-2017). The share of renewable energy used for transport in the EU rose from 7.4 % in 2017 to 8.1 % in 2018. This is well below the EU target of 10 % set for 2020. More than 27 % of European citizens are exposed to transport noise levels of 55 decibels (dB) or higher, including 15-20 % for road traffic noise alone.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/walking-cycling-and-public-transport"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0089", "date": "2020-01-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Improving circular economy practices in the construction sector key to increasing material reuse, high quality recycling", "text": "The EEA briefing \u2018Construction and demolition waste: challenges and opportunities in a circular economy,\u2019 says more must be done in preventing or recycling the large amount of waste produced by the construction and demolition sector in Europe. Such waste, such as scrap metal, used cement or wood products, currently make up the largest waste stream in the European Union. At present, many of the material streams from demolition and renovation works are not suitable for reuse or high-grade recycling. This is stalling efforts in shifting to a circular economy. The briefing examines how circular economy-inspired actions can help achieve EU waste policy objectives, such as waste prevention and increasing the quantity and quality of recycling for the waste produced on building sites, while also reducing hazardous waste materials. The briefing is based on a report compiled by the EEA and the European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy. The briefing notes that construction and demolition waste totaled 374 million tonnes in the EU in 2016, excluding excavated soil. The high volume and nature of produced waste are challenging to manage, but also present a clear opportunity to implement sound waste management practices according to the circular economy principles. Besides, the construction sector is considered a priority sector according to the forthcoming European Commission circular economy action plan. While EU countries are on track to meet the 70 % recovery target of 2020 with most countries already exceeding the target in 2016, the briefing says, closer scrutiny of waste management practices at national level shows that recovery of construction waste is largely based on low-value backfilling operations \u2014 using collected waste and rubble to fill holes on construction sites, and low-grade recovery such as using recycled and crushed cement or stones (aggregates) in road construction. The briefing notes that better waste prevention and higher and better quality recycling can be achieved if certain measures are followed to improve pricing, improve information on which materials are used in existing and new buildings and to improve users\u2019 trust in the quality of using secondary materials like recycled aggregates. Circular economy-inspired actions, like improved information sharing on material properties, and better re-use of secondary raw materials can go a long way in increasing circularity in the sector.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/improving-circular-economy-practices-in"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0090", "date": "2019-12-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Renewables crucial for EU decarbonisation, but technology choices matter for air quality", "text": "The EEA briefing \u2018Renewable energy in Europe: key for climate objectives, but air pollution needs attention\u2019 looks at the deployment of renewable energy in the EU since 2005 and its contribution to EU\u2019s climate and energy goals. It also analyses the effect of renewables growth on air pollutant emissions. The EEA briefing is based on the detailed analysis \u2018Renewable energy in Europe \u2013 2019. Recent growth and knock-on effects\u2019, prepared by the European Topic Centre on Climate change Mitigation and Energy. The EEA briefing shows that the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption has increased continuously both at the EU level and in most Member States. According to EEA\u2019s preliminary estimates, the share of energy from renewable sources reached 18.0 % of gross final EU energy use in 2018. About half of all renewable energy is currently used for heating purposes. The EU target of a 20 % share of renewable energy by 2020 is now within reach. The continuous growth in renewables has also relieved much of the need to burn fossil fuels to meet energy demand. Without the progress achieved since 2005, the EU\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions would have been 11 % higher in 2018 and the EU would not be in a position to meet its 20 % reduction target by 2020. The increasing share of renewables has also cut the emissions of some air pollutants, mainly sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. However, the EEA briefing shows that emissions of particulate matter and volatile organic compounds have increased, especially due to more solid biomass being burned inefficiently for domestic heating. Burning biomass has been a key driver for the growth in renewable energy use, especially in the heating sector, but also in the electricity sector (where wind and solar photovoltaic electricity grew faster).

These extremely persistent and man-made chemicals are used in a variety of consumer products and industrial applications because of their unique properties, for example, to increase oil and water repellence, reduce surface tension, or resist high temperatures and chemicals. Currently more than 4 700 different PFAS exist, which, due to their extreme persistence, accumulate in people and the environment. Although there is a lack of systematic mapping and monitoring of potentially polluted sites in Europe, national monitoring activities have detected PFAS in the environment across Europe, and the production and use of PFAS have also resulted in the contamination of drinking water supplies in several European countries. Human biomonitoring has also detected a range of PFAS in the blood of European citizens. The EEA briefing warns that, due to the large number of PFAS, it is a difficult and time-consuming task to assess and manage risks for these substances individually, which may lead to widespread and irreversible pollution. The costs to society due to harm to human health and remediation in Europe have been estimated to be tens of billions of EUR annually.

We have a narrow window of opportunity in the next decade to scale up measures to protect nature, lessen the impacts of climate change and radically reduce our consumption of natural resources. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director While European environment and climate policies have helped to improve the environment over recent decades, Europe is not making enough progress and the outlook for the environment in the coming decade is not positive, according to the \u2018European environment \u2014 state and outlook 2020 (SOER 2020)\u2019 report. SOER 2020 is the most comprehensive environmental assessment ever undertaken on Europe. It provides a stark snapshot of where Europe stands in meeting 2020 and 2030 policy targets as well as longer term 2050 goals and ambitions to shift to a sustainable, low carbon future. The report notes that Europe has already made significant progress over the past two decades in terms of climate change mitigation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Signs of progress are also evident in other areas, such as tackling air and water pollution and the introduction of new policies to tackle plastic waste and bolster climate change adaptation and the circular and bio-economy. Furthermore, the EU\u2019s sustainable finance initiative is the first of its kind on the role of the financial sector in driving the necessary shift to a sustainable future. Urgent call for scaling up and speeding up change While these achievements are significant, Europe will not achieve its sustainability vision of \u2018living well within the limits of the planet\u2019 by continuing to promote economic growth and seeking to manage the environmental and social impacts. The report urges European countries, leaders and policymakers to seize the opportunity and use the next decade to radically scale up and speed up actions to put Europe back on track to meeting its medium and longer-term environmental policy goals and targets to avoid irreversible change and damage. The current range of European policy actions provide an essential foundation for future progress but they are not enough. Europe needs to do things better, it needs to address certain challenges differently, and it needs to rethink its investments. Achieving Europe\u2019s goals will require better implementation and improved coordination between current policies. It will also need additional policy actions to achieve fundamental change in the key systems of production and consumption that underpin our modern lifestyles, such as food, energy and mobility, which have substantial environmental impacts. The report also stresses the importance of how governments can enable a transition to sustainability and the need to address things differently. For example, Europe should rethink how it uses existing innovations and technologies, how production processes could be improved, how research and development into sustainability could be fostered and how changes in consumption patterns and ways of living could be stimulated. Lastly, achieving such change will require investing in a sustainable future and stopping using public funds to subsidise environmentally damaging activities. Europe will gain immensely from such a change in investment priorities because of the economic and social opportunities that it can create. At the same time, it will be crucial to listen to public concerns and ensure widespread support for such a shift \u2014 a socially fair transition. The State of the Environment Report is perfectly timed to give us the added impetus we need as we start a new five-year cycle in the European Commission and as we prepare to present the European Green Deal. In the next five years we will put in place a truly transformative agenda, rolling out new clean technologies, helping citizens to adapt to new job opportunities and changing industries, and shifting to cleaner and more efficient mobility systems and more sustainable food and farming.There will be multiple benefits for Europe and for Europeans if we get this right, and our economy and our planet will be winners too. This is an urgent global challenge, and a unique opportunity for Europe. Frans Timmermans, Executive Vice President of the European Commission. \u2018Europe\u2019s environment is at a tipping point. We have a narrow window of opportunity in the next decade to scale up measures to protect nature, lessen the impacts of climate change and radically reduce our consumption of natural resources. Our assessment shows that incremental changes have resulted in progress in some areas but not nearly enough to meet our long-term goals. We already have the knowledge, technologies and tools we need to make key production and consumption systems such as food, mobility and energy sustainable. Our future well-being and prosperity depend on this and our ability to harness society wide action to bring about change and create a better future,\u2019 said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. The state of the environment has worsened, outlook is mixed Overall environmental trends in Europe have not improved since the last EEA state of the environment report in 2015. The assessment notes that while most of the 2020 targets will not be achieved, especially those on biodiversity, there is still a chance to meet the longer-term goals and objectives for 2030 and 2050. Europe has made important gains in resource efficiency and the circular economy. But recent trends highlight a slowing down of progress in areas such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, industrial emissions, waste generation, improving energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy. Looking ahead, the current rate of progress will not be enough to meet 2030 and 2050 climate and energy targets. Protecting and conserving European biodiversity and nature remains the biggest area of discouraging progress. Of the 13 specific policy objectives set for 2020 in this area, only two are likely be met: designating marine protected areas and terrestrial protected areas. Looking ahead to 2030, if current trends continue, they will result in further deterioration of nature and continued pollution of air, water and soil. Climate change, air and noise pollution impacts on the environment and human health are also still of concern. Exposure to fine particulate matter is responsible for around 400 000 premature deaths in Europe every year, affecting central and eastern European countries disproportionally. There is also growing concern over hazardous chemicals and the risks they pose. Looking ahead, the prospects for reducing environmental risks to health would be improved with better integration of environment and health policies.

A sustainable future is still possible: where to take action? Achieving Europe\u2019s low carbon and sustainability vision is still possible. The report outlines seven key areas where bold action is needed to get Europe back on track to achieve its 2030 and 2050 goals and ambitions. Realise the unfulfilled potential of existing environmental policies. Fully implementing existing policies would take Europe a long way to achieving its environmental goals up to 2030. Embrace sustainability as the framework for policy making. Developing long-term policy frameworks with binding targets \u2014 starting with the food system, chemicals and land use \u2014 will stimulate and guide coherent actions across policy areas and society. Lead international action towards sustainability. The EU should use its diplomatic and economic influence to promote the adoption of ambitious international agreements in areas such as biodiversity and resource use. Foster innovation throughout society. Changing the current trajectory will closely depend on the emergence and spread of diverse forms of innovation that can trigger new ways of thinking and living. Scale up investments and reorient the finance sector to support sustainable projects and businesses.This requires investing in the future by making full use of public funds to support innovation and nature-based solutions, procuring sustainably and supporting impacted sectors and regions. It also entails engaging the financial sector in sustainable investment by implementing and building on the EU\u2019s Sustainable Finance Action Plan. Manage risks and ensure a socially fair transition. A successful transition to sustainability will require that societies acknowledge potential risks, opportunities and trade-offs, and devise ways to manage them. EU and national policies have an essential role in achieving \u2018just transitions\u2019 making sure no one is left behind. Build more knowledge and know-how. This entails additional focus on understanding the systems driving environmental pressures, pathways to sustainability, promising initiatives and barriers to change. Further capacity-building is needed to navigate a rapidly changing world by investing in education and skills.

According to the briefing, EU Member States report better and more complete information about their climate policies, including on their expected emission savings. However, reported evidence on the achieved emission cuts and costs of these policies is still insufficient. EU Member States have reported 1 925 climate change mitigation policies and measures to the EEA. More than 400 of these policies are new since 2017, and are mostly at the planning stage, reflecting also the ongoing preparation of National Energy and Climate Plans.\u00a0The EEA data shows that most EU Member States\u2019 climate policies are either economic instruments (44 %), such as subsidies or feed-in tariffs, or regulations (43 %), for example, on energy efficiency.

According to the EEA study, the production and handling of clothing, footwear and household textiles that were sold in the EU in 2017 used an estimated 1.3 tonnes of primary raw materials and 104\u00a0cubic metres of water per EU person. About 85 % of these materials and 92 % of the water were used in other regions of the world. For water consumption and the use of primary raw materials, clothing, footwear and household textiles represent the fourth highest consumption category in the EU, after food, housing and transport. The same product group causes the second highest pressure on land use (after food), and also a considerable amount of chemical and water pollution, including plastic microfibres released through washing, as well as various negative social impacts.

About three quarters of these emissions took place outside of the EU. Circular economy for textiles Circular economy policies and principles, such as eco-design and reusing, hold potential to mitigate the environmental and climate impacts of textile production and consumption, the EEA briefing states. Current EU policies require Member States to collect textiles separately by 2025 and ensure that waste collected separately is not incinerated or landfilled. According to the EEA, circular business models in textiles\u00a0\u2014 such as leasing, sharing, and take-back and resale\u00a0\u2014 need to be scaled up with the support of policies addressing materials and design, production and distribution, use and reuse, collection and recycling. This can include policies such as sustainable production and product policies, eco design and durability standards,\u00a0 green public procurement, safe and sustainable materials, waste prevention and\u00a0 extended producer responsibility, and labelling and standards.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/private-consumption-textiles-eus-fourth-1"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0096", "date": "2019-10-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Climate change: Significant drop in EU emissions in 2018 but further effort needed to reach 2030 target", "text": "The EEA report \u2018Trends and projections in Europe 2019\u00a0\u2014 Tracking progress towards Europe\u2019s climate and energy targets\u2019 presents analysis of the EU progress towards the 2020 and 2030 targets for climate and energy. The analysis is based on official statistics on energy and GHG emissions up to 2017; preliminary data for 2018, including the 'approximated EU GHG inventory';\u00a0and national projections of GHG emissions reported in 2019. Two specific analyses provide an overview of emission trends under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) up to 2030, and of GHG intensity of transport fuels in 2017. Reducing GHG emissions: more national efforts needed towards 2030 The EEA analysis shows that the EU is firmly on track to achieve its 2020 target to reduce GHG emissions by 20 %, compared with 1990 levels. Preliminary data from Member States indicate that the EU\u2019s total emissions decreased by 2.0 % in 2018, bringing the total reductions to 23.2\u00a0% below 1990 levels. However, Member States\u2019 projections are not yet in line with the target for 2030 of at least a 40 % reduction in GHG emissions. According to the EEA analysis, Member States\u2019 current policies can deliver only a 30 % reduction by 2030, while implementing all reported planned policies could bring the total reduction to 36 %. Based on 2019 reports to the EEA, only Greece, Portugal and Sweden expect to reach their 2030 Effort Sharing targets on time with current policies and measures in place. Seven other Member States (Belgium, Croatia, France, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia and Spain) project to achieve their targets with additional policies. EU Emissions Trading System: emissions down, auctioning revenues up A separate EEA briefing on the EU ETS shows that total emissions from stationary installations declined by 4.1 % from 2017 to 2018. This decrease was particularly driven by the reduced use of coal in power plants. In contrast, emissions from airlines continued to increase, by 4.0 % in 2018 due to the growing demand in air travel. Collectively, Member States\u2019 projections with existing national policies indicate a 36 % cut in ETS emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. This is not yet in line with the targeted contribution of a 43 % reduction, the EEA briefing notes. Fewer EU emission allowances were auctioned in 2018 but revenue from those auctions increased from EUR 5.5 billion to EUR 14.1 billion, due to the increase in the average allowance price from EUR 5.8 per tonne in 2017 to EUR 15.5 per tonne in 2018. Deploying renewable energy: 2020 target within reach The target to increase the share of renewables in final energy consumption to 20 % in the EU by 2020 is \u201cwithin reach\u201d, according to the report. The EEA estimates that the share of renewables was 18.0 % in 2018. In the transport sector however, only 7.6\u00a0% of energy came from renewable sources in 2017 and an estimated 8.1 % in 2018, leaving the sector at risk of missing the 10 % target set for 2020. The share of renewable energy is not yet increasing fast enough to reach the EU target of 32 % by 2030. According to the EEA analysis, the share of renewables has been growing at an average rate of 0.7 percentage points every year but, over the next decade, the increase needs to be at least 1.1\u00a0percentage points per year on average. Energy efficiency: risk of not meeting 2020 targets The EEA estimates that final energy consumption\u00a0\u2014 energy consumed by end users\u00a0\u2014 in the EU in 2018 grew for the fourth consecutive year, by 0.1 %. The worrying overall trend is most prevalent in buildings, where final energy consumption increased by 8.3 % from 2014 to 2017, and in transport where the increase was 5.8 % in the same period. Meanwhile, estimates indicate that primary energy consumption\u00a0\u2014 total energy demand\u00a0\u2014 decreased by 0.9 % in 2018. With these trends, meeting the 2020 energy efficiency target appears increasingly difficult, the EEA warns. Moreover, to meet the 2030 target of 32.5 % reductions, EU energy consumption needs to decline more than twice as fast as it did from 2005 to 2017. Despite the overall trends and the risk of missing the 2020 energy efficiency target at EU level, a number of Member States have demonstrated notable progress in this area, the EEA notes. Slow progress in transport fuels The EEA\u2019s \u2018Quality and greenhouse gas intensities of transport fuels in the EU in 2017\u2019 report shows that suppliers of fuel for road transport are not reducing the GHG intensity of fuels fast enough to meet the 6\u00a0% reduction target by 2020, compared with 2010. Based on data from 22 Member States, the average GHG intensity of the fuels consumed in these countries was only 3.4\u00a0% lower than in 2010 in 2017 (2.3\u00a0% when considering emissions related to indirect land-use change which are used by fuel suppliers for reporting purposes). According to the EEA report, diesel continues to dominate fuel sales in the EU with 72.3\u00a0% of sales in 2017. The share of diesel as compared with petrol has increased over the years, from 55.6\u00a0% of total sales in 2001 to 72.3\u00a0% in 2017. All diesel sold in the EU contained biodiesel, whereas 87.6\u00a0% of petrol contained bioethanol.

There is growing concern over the impact of such waste on the environment and our health, as well as the impacts of increased resource extraction, production and consumption. Waste generation also contributes to air, water and soil pollution as well as climate change and biodiversity loss. The two EEA briefings provide an assessment of the role of plastic waste export in the circular economy and a snapshot of resource losses from waste management \u2013 the latter looking specifically at waste from electrical and electronic equipment, end-of-life batteries, plus textile and plastic waste. Reducing plastic waste exports is an opportunity to reuse and recycle In early 2019, the EU exported about 150 000 tonnes of plastic waste per month. This is around half the amount exported in 2015 and 2016, when exports went primarily to China and Hong Kong. However, new bans and restrictions on imports by China, combined with a number of banned types of plastic being added to a United Nations convention, are forcing the EU and countries to improve their own capacities to handle the waste at home. These bans and restrictions and a shrinking international market for plastics will likely increase landfilling and incineration in the short term, but should also trigger investments in capacities and systems to increase recycling and reuse of plastic waste. The EEA briefing on exports of plastic waste shows there is huge potential to increase reuse and recycling in the coming years. Reusing and recycling plastic waste could provide a large amount of material resources for local manufacturers. The briefing notes that the EU has already taken steps to improve the management of plastic production, use and waste, including the European strategy for plastics in the circular economy, the EU\u2019s Single Use Plastics Directive, and new, more ambitious targets for plastic recycling included in the EU\u2019s updated waste directives of 2018. Figure 1. Extra-EU-28 plastic waste trade by receiving country Sources: Based on Eurostat data (accessed 9 July 2019); ETC/WMGE 2019; EEA. Sustainable waste management is key Progress is being made in Europe to bolster an already ambitious waste policy and to establish a solid circular economy framework. However, the EU is still losing out on opportunities to reuse a significant amount of valuable resources currently being lost through inefficient waste management practices. The EEA briefing on resources and waste management shows that tens of millions of tonnes of plastic waste are generated in the EU every year. Alongside plastics, millions more of tonnes of electronic waste \u2013 like old computers, cameras or TVs, and textiles (mostly clothing) are also regularly thrown away with little to no recycling or repurposing. Poor or inadequate collection, reuse and recycling of these waste streams plus low consumer awareness of the waste problem all need addressing in order to improve the situation. The presence of hazardous substances can also hamper recycling and hence opportunities to move to increased circularity, as do products not properly designed for recycling.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/reuse-and-recycling-are-key"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0098", "date": "2019-10-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Cutting air pollution in Europe would prevent early deaths, improve productivity and curb climate change", "text": "Europe has now a unique opportunity to set an ambitious agenda that tackles the systemic causes of environmental pressures and air pollution. We are making progress but it\u2019s time to speed up the changes in our energy, food and mobility systems to put us on a trajectory of sustainability and a healthy environment. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The EEA\u2019s \u2018Air quality in Europe \u2014 2019 report\u2019 shows that almost all Europeans living in cities are still exposed to air pollution levels that exceed the health-based air quality guidelines set by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The new EEA analysis is based on the latest official\u00a0air quality data from more than 4 000 monitoring stations\u00a0across Europe in 2017. Three main pollutants cause significant damage Poor air quality continues to damage Europeans' health, especially in urban areas, with particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ground-level ozone (O3) causing the biggest harm. According to the EEA analysis, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) alone caused about 412,000 premature deaths in 41 European countries in 2016. About 374,000 of those deaths occurred in the European Union (EU). As well as damaging health and reducing life expectancy, poor air quality also causes economic losses, for example, through higher health care costs, reduced yields from agriculture and forestry, and lower labour productivity. An earlier EEA assessment showed how air and noise pollution and extreme temperatures disproportionately affect Europe\u2019s most vulnerable citizens. Health benefits of improving air quality Despite persisting pollution, the new EEA data confirm that binding regulations and local measures are improving Europe\u2019s air quality with positive health effects. For example, fine particulate matter caused about 17,000 fewer premature deaths in the EU in 2016, compared with 2015. Even though weather differences between years can affect pollution levels and their impacts, the reduction is consistent with the EEA\u2019s earlier estimate that the number of premature deaths caused annually by PM2.5 in Europe have been reduced by about half a million since 1990. \u00a0 Compared with the WHO guidelines, long-term fine particulate matter concentrations were too high at 69 % of monitoring stations across Europe in 2017, including at least some monitoring stations in all reporting countries, except Estonia, Finland and Norway. Compared with the EU limit values, fine particulate matter concentrations were too high in seven EU Member States in 2017 (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Italy, Poland, Romania and Slovakia) In addition, four EU Member States, (Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) have not yet met the EU\u2019s 2015 target for the three-year average exposure for fine particulate matter. 'The European Environment Agency\u2019s Air Quality in Europe report is an important and timely reminder that air pollution continues to impact most regions across the European Union, and affects the lives of most citizens. It is simply unacceptable that any of us should need to worry about whether the simple act of breathing is safe or not. We therefore need to work even harder to make sure our EU air quality standards are met everywhere,' said Karmenu Vella, EU Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. Potential in curbing both air pollution and climate change Road transport, power plants, industry, agriculture and households are the main sources of air pollutants. These sources are closely linked to Europe\u2019s core systems of production and consumption, and are also key drivers of greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. 'Europe has now a unique opportunity to set an ambitious agenda that tackles the systemic causes of environmental pressures and air pollution. We are making progress but it\u2019s time to speed up the changes in our energy, food and mobility systems to put us on a trajectory of sustainability and a healthy environment', said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. Ursula von der Leyen, the President-elect of the European Commission, has put forward a \u201cEuropean Green Deal\u201d as the first priority of her Political Guidelines for the new Commission. This agenda includes the goal of making Europe the first climate neutral continent, ensuring a just transition, and moving towards zero-pollution by putting forward a \u201ccross-cutting strategy to protect citizens\u2019 health from environmental degradation and pollution, addressing air and water quality, hazardous chemicals, industrial emissions, pesticides and endocrine disrupters.\u201d In many European cities, citizens are demanding cleaner air for themselves and their children. The EEA\u2019s European Air Quality Index provides citizens with a tool for checking the air quality in their city and supports public engagement in efforts to reduce air pollution.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EU Clean Air Forum The European Commission is organising the second EU Clean Air Forum, hosted by the Government of Slovakia in Bratislava, on 28\u201329 November 2019, to discuss the development and implementation of European, national and local air policies, projects and programmes. The 2019 Forum will focus on energy, agriculture, and clean air funding mechanisms. Methodological background The EEA has published a briefing, EEA\u2019s health risk assessments of air pollution, that provides an overview of how the EEA calculates its estimates on the health impacts of poor air quality. The health impacts of exposure to air pollution are diverse, ranging from inflammation of the lungs to premature deaths. In the EEA\u2019s health risk assessment, mortality is selected as the health outcome that is quantified, as it is the one for which the evidence is most robust. Mortality due to the long-term exposure to air pollution is estimated in terms of \u201cpremature deaths\u201d and as \u201cyears of life lost\u201d. The estimates provide a measure of the general impact of air pollution across a given population and, for example, the numbers cannot be assigned to specific individuals living in a specific geographical location. The health impacts are estimated individually for the three pollutants (PM2.5, NO2\u00a0and O3) and the numbers cannot be added together to determine total health impacts, as this may lead to double counting.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/cutting-air-pollution-in-europe"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0099", "date": "2019-10-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "New challenges facing Europe\u2019s waste water treatment plants present opportunities for improving sustainability", "text": "Much has already been done in recent decades to improve waste water treatment, according to the EEA briefing \u2018urban waste water treatment for 21st century challenges\u2019. The proportion of households connected to treatment facilities varies across Europe, from 97% in western and central Europe, to around 70% in southern, south-eastern and eastern Europe. However, urban waste water treatment now needs to address challenges like climate change, changes in population and newly emerging pollutants. Extreme weather events linked to climate change are bringing heavier and more frequent rainfall in some areas, but water scarcity in others, affecting how well storm sewers and treatment plants operate. Excessive rainstorms can overwhelm and overload sewer systems and lead to overflows at treatment plants, while a lack of rainfall can lead to problems in collection and treatment of sewage. Such challenges are added to those routinely addressed by local authorities and water utilities, including financing construction, maintenance, operation and upgrades, as well as sourcing and retaining suitably skilled staff to deliver the necessary improvements in waste water treatment. The EEA briefing also notes that antibiotics and other excreted pharmaceuticals are increasingly being found in waste water. These chemicals are among those forming a cocktail mix of chemicals, which cannot be easily tackled by many treatment plants, as they require costly, more stringent and energy-intensive treatment techniques. \u00a0 Sustainable solutions and investments are key The briefing notes that energy costs and scarce resources are reasons to promote water efficiency. Furthermore, they provide an opportunity for treatment plants to contribute more to recycling and reusing water and recovering materials like phosphorus, which can be collected during the treatment cycle.

European companies are increasingly adopting circular business models, focused mainly on operational efficiency and reducing waste, according to the report. Shifting from product-based to service-based business models is another promising development. The biggest obstacles to greater uptake of such models appear to be corporate culture, market factors and system complexity. EEA surveys indicate that 21 out of 32 responding EEA member countries already support circular economy initiatives. Countries use regulation and market-based instruments mainly for recycling, energy recovery and waste management, while eco-design, consumption and reuse are typically targeted with softer policy instruments such as information campaigns and labels.

To ensure that future generations continue to benefit from these services, we need to take decisive action today. The responsibility to protect these vital resources lies with us all \u2014 from consumers to farmers, and from local to European and global policymakers. This can only be achieved by acting together today towards a common goal. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The EEA Signals 2019 \u2018Land and soil in Europe\u2019 explains key pressures \u2014 such as urban sprawl, contamination, intensive use of agricultural land, landscape fragmentation \u2014 impacting Europe\u2019s land and soil. Today, artificial surfaces (buildings, roads, urban facilities) cover less than 5 % of the wider EEA territory and continue to grow despite slowing down in recent years. Almost three quarters of Europeans live in urban areas and continued urban sprawl is often threatening productive land used for farming as well as forests and other areas home to wildlife and vital ecosystems. The report underlines that we need to preserve and protect these key resources better. For example, the way we build and connect cities should prioritise \u2018land recycling\u2019, which consists of re-using and re-purposing existing urban areas such as old industrial sites and avoid new land to be covered by concrete and asphalt. Europe\u2019s urban population is projected to grow by 30 million by 2050. Given these projections, compact cities with well-connected mobility options will need to play a key role to provide better quality of urban life with fewer impacts on the environment. Similarly, pressure from economic activities, including agriculture, can adversely affect the health of land and soils. Plant protection products containing harmful chemicals can boost yields in the short-term but risk undermining soil productivity in the long-term. Europe\u2019s agriculture sector relies on healthy soils, which can only be ensured through a comprehensive set of measures involving a combination of agricultural practices (e.g. precision farming, crop diversification, etc.), rural and agricultural communities (e.g. tackling land abandonment), as well as retailers and consumers (e.g. reducing food waste). Healthy and resilient soil ecosystems are also essential to help mitigate and adapt to climate change. Europe\u2019s soils and land store massive amounts of carbon. On the one hand, warmer temperatures can melt permafrost and release some of this carbon into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. On the other hand, a sustainable use of our soils can help keep this carbon stored in the ground. Natural areas or soils not covered by artificial surfaces or compacted by heavy machinery can help absorb excess rain in case of intense precipitation or act as a water storage in times of drought. The report also addresses the need to protect land ecosystems better, and to ensure that natural areas, home to wildlife, are better connected to each other to enable species to move and migrate. This requires an extensive network of green infrastructure, connecting natural areas. New tools, like the European Union\u2019s Earth observation and monitoring programme, Copernicus, which is revolutionising the way we understand and plan for the more sustainable use of our valuable land and soil resources. A healthy and sustainable use of our land and soil resources will help the Europe Union achieve many of its policy targets ranging from climate change mitigation to halting biodiversity loss, as well as Sustainable Development Goals.

The briefing is based on a recent study\u00a0by the European Topic Centre on Air Pollution, Transport, Noise and Industrial Pollution. The briefing shows that European countries that have actively promoted electric vehicles have significantly reduced the average CO2 emissions from new cars. This has also resulted in other clear benefits, such as reduced emissions of air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter. However, the effects of tax incentives that promote conventional fuel-efficient cars are less clear, the briefing states. These incentives are based on type-approval emissions tested in the laboratory, which are lower than the real-world emissions on the road. As the gap between type-approval CO2 emissions and real-world emissions has increased, the real-world emissions of new cars have decreased significantly less than expected. Testing vehicle emissions The emissions of new vehicles are systematically tested under standardised laboratory conditions, using \u2018type approval\u2019 procedures. Since 2017, the new Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) has been put in place, with the objective to gradually replace the outdated New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The WLTP allows to obtain more realistic information on vehicle emissions in the type approval tests. In 2018, Member States reported both NEDC and WLTP emission factors for around 4.4 million cars (around 30\u00a0% of new registrations).

Ozone-depleting substances (ODS)\u00a0are widely used in refrigerants, polymers, pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals.\u00a0 The new EEA report shows that the consumption of ozone-depleting substances in the EU in 2018 remained negative (-1\u00a0505 tonnes), which means that more of these substances were destroyed or exported than produced or imported. The EU\u2019s consumption of these substances has been negative since 2010 with the exception of 2012. The results reflect the successful implementation of the EU's 'ODS Regulation' (EC) No 1005/2009, which goes further than the Montreal Protocol, in combination with high destruction rates and decreasing stocks. The EEA report is published on the\u00a0International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, which is marked every year on 16 September. Background In 1989, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer entered into force. Its objective is to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out the production of ozone-depleting substances (ODS). The protocol covers over 200 individual substances with a high ozone-depleting potential (ODP), including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride (CTC), 1,1,1-Trichloroethane (TCA), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs), bromochloromethane (BCM) and methyl bromide (MB), all of which are referred to as \u2018controlled substances\u2019. The Montreal Protocol was amended in October 2016, in Kigali, Rwanda, to regulate hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Used as substitutes to CFCs, HFCs are potent greenhouse gases and their production and consumption has grown significantly over the last decades.

The report sets out 10 sets of messages for policy, outlining how governments and other actors can enable systemic change towards long-term sustainability goals. Focusing in particular on Europe\u2019s food, energy and mobility systems, the report illustrates the importance of promoting diverse innovations \u2014 social practices, business models, technologies \u2014\u00a0that can trigger new ways of living and thinking. It points to the critical need to empower cities as hubs of innovation and networking, to reorient financial flows towards sustainable and transformative innovations, to navigate inevitable surprises and trade-offs, and to ensure socially fair outcomes. The report also emphasises that achieving sustainability transitions requires that all policy areas and levels of government operate together to harness the creativity and power of citizens, businesses and communities. Environment and climate policy tools remain essential but transforming systems also requires coherent contributions from many other areas, ranging from research and innovation, industry, competition and trade, to employment, education and welfare.

Despite some progress, much more must be done to adapt by the sector itself, and especially at farm-level, and future EU policies need to be designed in a way to facilitate and accelerate transition in this sector. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director Adverse impacts of climate change are already being felt across Europe. Extreme weather, including recent heatwaves in many parts of the EU are already causing economic losses for farmers and for the EU\u2019s agriculture sector. Future climate change might also have some positive effects due to longer growing seasons and more suitable crop conditions, but these effects will be outweighed by the increase in extreme events negatively affecting the sector. These adverse impacts are expected to increase, due to projected climate change, according to the EEA report \u2018Climate change adaptation in the agricultural sector in Europe.\u2019 The report looks at the key climate change problems facing agriculture in the EU and the outlook for the years ahead. It also gives an overview of how EU policies and programmes address climate change adaptation and includes examples of feasible and successful adaptation actions. The EEA assessment is consistent with the key messages from the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on climate change and land. \u2019New records are being set around the world due to climate change, and the adverse effects of this change are already affecting agricultural production in Europe, especially in the south. Despite some progress, much more must be done to adapt by the sector itself, and especially at farm-level, and future EU policies need to be designed in a way to facilitate and accelerate transition in this sector,\u2019 said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. Climate impacts have led to poorer harvests and higher production costs, affecting price, quantity and the quality of farmed products in parts of Europe. While climate change is projected to improve conditions for growing crops in parts of northern Europe, the opposite is true for crop productivity in southern Europe. According to projections using a high-end emission scenario, yields of non-irrigated crops like wheat, corn and sugar beet are projected to decrease in southern Europe by up to 50 % by 2050. This could result in a substantial drop in farm income by 2050, with large regional variations. In a similar scenario, farmland values are projected to decrease in parts of southern Europe by more than 80 % by 2100, which could result in land abandonment. Trade patterns are also impacted, which in turn affects agricultural income. While food security is not under threat in the EU, increased food demand worldwide could exert pressure on food prices in the coming decades, the report says. Adaptation at farm level is key Most of the EEA member countries have national adaptation strategies in place. While all of these strategies include agriculture as a priority sector, only a limited number of countries included adaptation measures specific to the agriculture sector. The EU\u2019s adaptation strategy is a key driver of adaptation actions in Europe. One of its objectives is to mainstream adaptation in various EU policies, including the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). However, adaptation at the farm level often does not take place because of lack of financing, policy support to adapt, institutional capacity and access to adaptation know-how. The EEA report stresses that more knowledge, innovation and awareness raising are required to improve the effective use of the already available adaptation measures, like introducing adapted crops, improved irrigation techniques, field margins and agroforestry, crop diversification or precision farming (see the figure). These practices should also lead to lower greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions, better management of soil, land and water resources, which in turn will help preserve local ecosystems and biodiversity. The report also suggests that EU Member States should better prioritise adaptation in the agricultural sector, for example by increasing the financing of adaptation measures through the implementation of the CAP. Figure 5.3. Measures at farm level Source: EEA, 2019 Agriculture remains a driver of climate change The agricultural sector also has a crucial role to play in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. Agriculture accounts for around 10 % of all greenhouse gases in the EU. Methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation make up the largest share and ammonia (NH3) and primary particulate matter (PM10) are the two most important air pollutants from agriculture. While greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture have decreased since 1990, more will need to be done by the sector to contribute to reaching EU greenhouse gas emission reduction targets by 2030 and 2050. To reduce greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions, Europe needs to reshape its food system and reduce agricultural emissions from fertilisers, manure storage and livestock. This can be achieved through improvements in fertiliser use, in manure handling efficiencies and in animal productivity through breeding for example. Consumer behaviour will also need to change. Changing diets, like eating less meat and reducing food waste would contribute to additional reductions. New EU brochure on forestry and adaptation Related to the issue of climate change and adaptation, the European Commission\u2019s LIFE (The Financial Instrument for the Environment and Climate Action programme) published a brochure on adaptation \u2018Ready, steady, green!\u2019, which shows how LIFE helps farming and forestry adapt to climate change.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/climate-change-threatens-future-of"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0107", "date": "2019-07-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU Member States make only mixed progress in reducing emissions under UN convention, latest air pollution data shows", "text": "The EEA report \u00a0confirms, as highlighted in the recent EEA briefing on the EU\u2019s National Emissions Ceilings Directive earlier this month, that after many years of past declines, for more than half of the 26 pollutants monitored emissions increased slightly in 2017 compared to the previous year. Releases came from key sources such as agriculture, transport, industry and private households. The report notes that between 2016 and 2017, emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx) dropped by 1.8% and 1.3% respectively. However, emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) increased by 1.3%, carbon monoxide (CO) emissions by 0.2% and ammonia (NH3) by 0.4%. Emissions of particulate matter, and several heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants also all increased slightly in 2017 compared to the previous year. In recent years, the rate of emission reductions has stagnated for many pollutants. And as noted, for a number, it has actually slightly increased. \u00a0For example, ammonia emissions, which can lead to particulate matter formation in the atmosphere, have fallen less than emissions of the other main pollutants since 1990 and increased in each of the past four years. The report also highlights the growing importance of the residential stationary combustion sector, which includes the burning of fuels in domestic stoves. This source makes a significant contribution to the total emissions of many pollutants and contributed 51% of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emitted directly into the air in 2017. Further, 42% of total carbon monoxide, 42% of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 24% of the dioxin and furan compounds and 16% of the heavy metal cadmium were released by this single source. The LRTAP report tracks the emissions of key air pollutants over past years. It is submitted by the EU to the UNECE under the requirements of the Gothenburg Protocol to the LRTAP Convention, which aims to limit, and as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution. The protocol also sets emission limits for a range of air pollutants that have to be met from 2010 onwards, which for Member States are either equivalent to or less ambitious than those specified under the 2010 EU NEC Directive. Air pollution is the single largest environmental risk to human health in Europe, causing respiratory problems and shortening lifespans. Poor air quality caused by air pollution can also harm vegetation and sensitive ecosystems.

It also looks at how the E-PRTR web portal is used to track environmental policy implementation and outcomes and widen knowledge of industrial emissions in Europe. Data in the register shows that over the past 10 years emissions from industrial facilities to both air and water have decreased. E-PRTR data is also used in studies to assess the effectiveness of environmental policies addressing industrial pollution, such as the EU Industrial Emissions Directive. For example, a recent EEA report \u2018Assessing the effectiveness of EU policy on large combustion plants in reducing air pollutant emissions\u2019\u00a0looked into the reasons for the observed emissions reductions tracked by the register. The study concluded that a significant part of the reductions for combustion activities took place due to requirements set out in EU environmental legislation on industrial pollution. Finding pollution near you The register has significantly facilitated public access to environmental information in Europe. Users of the register can zoom in on an area and see what pollutants are released from large industrial facilities. They can also find and identify top polluters from the data in the register or understand the environmental concerns around the various substances covered by the tool. The register currently contains over 10 years of data, covering over 34 000 facilities across the 28 Member States of the EU, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Serbia.

Over the 2014-2017 period, the overall increase was about 2.5%. These increases are because of the lack of emission reductions in the agricultural sector. Ammonia emissions can lead to increased acid depositions and excessive levels of nutrients in soil, rivers or lakes, which can have negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems and cause damage to forests, crops and other vegetation. Eutrophication can lead to severe reductions in water quality with subsequent impacts including decreased biodiversity, and toxicity effects. In 2017, the most recent year for which data were reported, total emissions of the four main air pollutants nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and ammonia \u2013 were below the respective ceilings set for the EU as a whole. While 21 EU Member States were in compliance with the ammonia emissions ceiling in 2017, six (Austria, Croatia, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Spain) were not and an increasing number of Member States are projected to miss their 2020 and 2030 emission reduction commitments. The EEA briefing notes that a more substantial reduction will be required for all pollutants if the EU is to achieve its emission reduction commitments for 2030. The EEA briefing also includes an update of projected emissions reported by EU Member States for 2020 and 2030 under the NEC Directive in relation to their individual reduction commitments set in the NEC Directive for these years. Reductions of around 15% are required for NMVOC and ammonia, more than 30% for particulate matter (PM2.5) and sulphur dioxide, and almost 40% for nitrogen oxides. Background The briefing presents progress made by the EU and its Member States in meeting the emissions ceilings that are applicable since 2010 and which are set out in the NEC Directive (2016/2284/EU). The EU legislation restricts emissions for four key air pollutants from 2010 onward; nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and ammonia (NH3), and also from 2020 for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The analysis is based on the latest air pollutant emission inventory data for the period 2010-2017, as reported by EU Member States in February 2019.

These pollutants are important as they are detrimental to human health, damage ecosystems and cause a wide range of economic losses.\u00a0\u00a0 During the period, SO2 emissions from large combustion plants in the EU decreased by 81 %, NOx emissions by 49 % and dust emissions by 77 %. According to the EEA assessment, the Directive accounted for most of these emission reductions. The EEA assessment also shows that the Large Combustion Directive has played an important role in harmonising the sector\u2019s environmental performance across the EU. According to the analysis, EU Member States with the highest emission factors in 2004 improved their environmental performance most, leading to much smaller differences between Member States by 2015. The emission reductions in large combustion plants provide a clear success story to build upon and many elements of the policy can be useful to implement the new rules and design regulation in other sectors. At the same time, the report notes aspects of the directive that could have been even more ambitious. This knowledge is valuable for the energy sector to meet its current targets for decarbonisation and cutting pollutant emissions. Large industrial facilities were among the most significant sources of SO2, NOx and dust pollution in the EU from 2004 to 2015 and, despite emissions cuts, they still represent significant sources of such emissions in many European countries. Evaluating and understanding the reasons for past environmental and climate policy successes are key to ensure that new policies are effective in stimulating a transition to a more sustainable Europe.

After a steady decline from 2010 to 2016, by almost 22 grammes of CO2 per kilometre (g CO2/km), average emissions from new passenger cars increased in 2017 by 0.4\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km. According the provisional data, the upward trend continued with an additional increase of 2.0\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km in 2018. Vans registered in the EU and Iceland in 2018 emitted on average 158.1 g CO2/km, which is 2.0 grams more than in 2017. This is the first increase in average CO2 emissions from new vans since the regulation came into force in 2011, following a sharp decrease in 2017. The main factors contributing to the increase of new passenger cars\u2019 emissions in 2018 include the growing share of petrol cars in new registrations, in particular in the sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment. Moreover, the market penetration of zero- and low-emission vehicles, including electric cars, remained slow in 2018. With the 2021 target of 95\u00a0g CO2/km approaching, much faster deployment of cars with low emissions is needed across Europe. Many factors affected the increase in CO2 emissions from new vans in 2018, including an increase in the mass, engine capacity and size of the vehicles. The market share of petrol vehicles also increased, constituting 3.6\u00a0% of the new vans fleet (2.4 % in 2017). The share of zero- and low-emission vans remained at the same level (1.7\u00a0%) as in 2017. Further efficiency improvements are needed to reach the EU target of 147 g CO2/km set for 2020. Other key findings: New cars Petrol cars were the most sold passenger vehicles in the EU and in Iceland, constituting almost 60 % of all new registrations. Diesel vehicles constituted 36 % of the new registrations, marking a drop of 9 percentage points from 2017, and 19 percentage points from 2011 when diesel cars peaked with a 55 % share of new registrations. On average, the CO2 emissions of diesel cars (121.5 g CO2/km) are now very close to those of petrol cars (123.4\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km). The difference of 1.9\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km was the lowest observed in the past 5 years. Around 4.5 million new cars sold in the EU and in Iceland in 2018 \u2014\u00a0almost one out of three \u2014\u00a0were SUVs. Compared to cars in similar segment, SUVs are typically heavier and have more powerful engines and larger frontal areas \u2014\u00a0all features that increase fuel consumption. The majority of new SUVs sold were powered by petrol, with average emissions of 133\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km, which is around 13\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km higher than the average emissions of other new petrol cars. Sales of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and battery-electric vehicles (BEV) continued to increase. With around 150\u00a0000 registrations, sales of BEVs increased by 50\u00a0% compared to 2017. However, the combined share of PHEVs and BEVs in all car sales remains low (2\u00a0% compared to 1.5% in 2017). The combined shares of PHEV and BEV sales were highest in Iceland (15\u00a0%), Sweden (8.4\u00a0%) and the Netherlands (6.8\u00a0%). Together with Estonia, Finland and Malta, these were the only countries where the average emissions of new cars decreased from 2017 to 2018. New vans In 2018, 1.66 million new vans were registered in the EU and in Iceland, which is an increase of 3.5% compared with 2017. Higher sales in Poland (+46\u00a0%), Croatia (+28\u00a0%) and Hungary (+21\u00a0%) were accompanied by lower sales in Italy (-6\u00a0%) and Spain (-5\u00a0%). Diesel vehicles continue to make up the vast majority of the new van fleet, constituting 94.7% of sales in 2018. However, the market share of petrol vans has been increasing since 2016. Two out of three new vans (70\u00a0%) registered in the EU and in Iceland were sold in just five Member States: the United Kingdom (20\u00a0%), France (19\u00a0%), Germany (15\u00a0%), Italy (9\u00a0%) and Spain (7\u00a0%). The average fuel-efficiency of new vans varied widely across Member States due to the different models and sizes of vehicles sold in each country. As in recent years, average emissions were lowest in Portugal (133.7 g CO2/km), followed by Bulgaria (134.4 g\u00a0CO2/km) and Cyprus (135.1 g CO2/km). Average emissions were highest in Germany (173.4\u00a0g CO2/km), the Czech Republic (170.0 g CO2/km) and Slovakia (169.7 g CO2/km). The average weight of new vans registered in 2018 was 1839 kg, which is a slight increase of 1%, if compared with 2017. It also varied across countries: smaller vehicles were sold in Bulgaria and Cyprus (< 1 590 kg); larger vehicles (>1 955 kg) in Slovakia, Finland and Czech Republic. In addition to the increase in the average mass of registered vans, a larger average engine capacity (+1 %) and a larger average vehicle size (+1.4 % in the average distance between front and rear wheels) also contributed to the increase in average CO2 emissions from new vans in 2018 compared to 2017. Testing vehicle emissions The emissions of new vehicles are systematically tested using \u2018type approval\u2019 procedures. Since 2017, the new Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) has been put in place, with the objective to gradually replace the outdated New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The WLTP allows to obtain more realistic information on vehicle emissions in the type approval tests. In 2018, Member States reported both NEDC and WLTP emission factors for around 4.4 million cars (around 30\u00a0% of new registrations). For those vehicles, the WLTP emission factor was on average 20\u00a0% higher than the NEDC emission factor. EEA activities The EEA collects and regularly makes available\u00a0data on new passenger cars and vans registered in Europe, in accordance with EU Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and Regulation (EU) No 510/2011. The data reported by all EU Member States and Iceland in order to evaluate the efficiency of the new vehicle fleet includes information on CO2\u00a0emissions and vehicle mass. For the first time, data reported by Iceland were also included.

This assessment supports the clean energy transition, which involves a massive expansion of renewable energy sources, many of which are sensitive to climate factors. The new assessment warns that climate change and extreme weather events increasingly affect all parts of the European energy system. The most important changes include increases in mean and extreme air and water temperatures, and changes in water availability, extreme climate\u2011related events, and coastal and marine hazards. These changes will affect the availability of primary energy sources \u2014\u00a0especially renewable energy sources \u2014\u00a0as well as the transformation, transmission, distribution and storage of energy, and energy demand. Some of the climate change impacts on the energy system can be economically beneficial, such as reduced energy demand for heating, but many impacts are negative for both the energy sector and the society as a whole. Such impacts include reduced cooling water availability for thermal power plants and reduced water availability for hydropower production, and increasing risks for energy infrastructure from extreme weather events and sea level rise, the assessment states. According to the EEA assessment, climate change impacts and related adaptation needs vary significantly across European regions. In general, northern Europe will experience both beneficial and adverse impacts on its energy system, whereas southern European regions face overwhelmingly adverse impacts. Selected climate change impacts on the energy system across Europe The evolving policy framework under the Energy Union provides unique opportunities for mainstreaming climate change adaptation in national and European energy planning. The assessment recommends considering the impacts of climate change in the development of national climate and energy plans and long\u2011term strategies under the EU Energy Union. Market actors in the energy sector should also consider strengthening climate resilience as an integral part of their business. Key findings: Water availability is generally projected to increase in northern Europe and decrease in southern Europe, but with marked seasonal differences. These changes can affect cooling water availability for thermal power plants, hydropower and bioenergy potential, fuel transport on rivers, and energy demand for water provision. Replacing coal\u2011fired power plants by solar and wind power radically reduces greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, thus contributing to mitigation as well as adaptation in water\u2011scarce regions. Biofuels and carbon capture and storage require significant amounts of water or arable land, which may limit their expansion, in particular in water-scarce regions. Warming temperatures decrease energy demand for heating, but increase energy demand for cooling. They can also affect electricity generation and transmission. Climate change can affect the potential for wind and solar power, but available projections are associated with significant uncertainty. Several studies indicate that, without appropriate adaptation measures, direct damages to the European energy system from extreme weather events could amount to billions of euros per year by the end of the century, with much larger indirect costs. Background The key driver for changes in the global and European energy system is the need for a clean energy transition that drastically reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The EU is building the Energy Union, which aims at making energy more secure, affordable and sustainable. The EU has adopted several quantitative targets related to the energy system in its 2030 climate and energy framework. The European Commission has proposed a strategy for a climate\u2011neutral economy by 2050, including several long\u2011term decarbonisation scenarios up to 2050. The EU has also evaluated its adaptation strategy with a view to revising it.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/climate-change-puts-pressure-on"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0115", "date": "2019-06-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Over 85% of European bathing sites rated as excellent for water quality", "text": "Our report confirms that Member States\u2019 efforts over the last 40 years, mainly in wastewater treatment, have paid off. Today, most Europeans enjoy excellent bathing water quality. However, this is only one of the many components, ranging from tackling plastic pollution to protecting marine life, we need to work on in order to achieve healthier seas, lakes and rivers. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director An overwhelming number \u2014 95.4% \u2014 of the 21 831 bathing water sites monitored in the 28 EU Member States met the minimum quality requirements under EU rules, according to this year\u2019s report by the European Commission and European Environment Agency (EEA). In addition, 300 bathing sites monitored in Albania and Switzerland were also included in the report. The level of bathing sites meeting the most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 quality standards rose slightly from 85.0% in 2017 to 85.1% last year. The number of those meeting the minimum \u2018sufficient\u2019 standing fell from 96% to 95.4% from 2017 to 2018. This minor drop is mostly due to the opening of new bathing waters sites for which the dataset of four bathing seasons required for the classification by the Directive is not yet available. In 2018, 301 (or 1.3%) of all bathing water sites in the EU, Albania and Switzerland were rated as having \u2018poor\u2019 water quality. This is slightly lower than the 1.4% in 2017. Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries said:\u00a0\u201cAs yesterday's World Environment Day showed, we face many challenges. But it is also good to celebrate the green success stories of the European Union. The quality of European Bathing Water sites is one such story to which everyone can relate. Through good testing, reporting, monitoring and sharing of expertise, we are sure to continue improving the quality of our favourite swimming spots. Our new Environmental Implementation Review will help Member States learn from each other how best to attain and keep the excellent standards we have achieved during the course of my mandate. I congratulated the EEA for helping to improve standards and also for providing this information in a regular and reliable way. That reliability allows you to make clear choices wherever you take the plunge this summer\u201d. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cOur report confirms that Member States\u2019 efforts over the last 40 years, mainly in wastewater treatment, have paid off. Today, most Europeans enjoy excellent bathing water quality. However, this is only one of the many components, ranging from tackling plastic pollution to protecting marine life, we need to work on in order to achieve healthier seas, lakes and rivers\u201d. Bathing water requirements are set out in the EU\u2019s Bathing Water Directive. Implementation of its rules has helped to vastly improve the quality of Europe\u2019s bathing water over the last 40 years. Effective monitoring and management introduced under the directive combined with the investments in the urban waste water treatment have led to a drastic reduction in untreated or partially treated municipal and industrial waste ending up in the water. Under the rules, local authorities collect water samples at officially identified bathing sites throughout the swimming season. Samples are analysed for two types of bacteria that indicate pollution from sewage or livestock. Accompanying this year\u2019s report, the EEA has published an updated interactive map\u00a0showing the performance of each bathing site. Updated country reports are also available. Proportion of bathing water sites with excellent water quality in European countries Other Key Findings: In four countries, 95% or more of bathing sites were found to have excellent water quality: Cyprus (99.1% of all sites), Malta (98.9% of all sites), Austria (97.3% of all sites), and Greece (97% of all sites). All reported bathing water sites in Cyprus, Greece, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Romania and Slovenia were of at least sufficient quality in 2018. The three countries with the highest numbers of poor quality bathing water sites are Italy (89 bathing water sites or 1.6%), France (54 sites or 1.6%) and Spain (50 sites or 2.2%). In comparison with 2017, the number of poor quality bathing water sites in France decreased (from 80 in 2017 to 54 in 2018), while there was an increase in poor quality bathing waters in Italy (from 79 to 89) and in Spain (from 38 to 50). Background The contamination of water by faecal bacteria continues to pose a risk to human health, especially if it is found at bathing water sites. Swimming at contaminated beaches or lakes can result in illness. The major sources of pollution are sewage and water draining from farms and farmland. Such pollution increases during heavy rains and floods due to sewage overflow and polluted drainage water being washed into rivers and seas. All EU Member States, plus Albania and Switzerland, monitor their bathing sites according to the provisions of the EU's Bathing Water Directive. The assessment of the bathing water quality under the Bathing Water Directive makes use of the values of two microbiological parameters: Intestinal enterococci and Escherichia coli.\u00a0 Bathing water quality is classified, depending on the levels of faecal bacteria detected, as 'excellent', 'good', 'sufficient' or 'poor', Where water is classified as 'poor', Member States should take measures such as banning bathing or advising against it, providing information to the public, and taking suitable corrective actions. \u00a0 The report is available in English, French and German.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/large-number-of-europes-bathing"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0116", "date": "2019-06-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Vote for your favourite sustainability photos", "text": "The EEA\u2019s photo competition, \u2018Sustainably Yours\u2019, has reached its final stage.

It mapped and analysed efforts across EEA Member Countries to address plastic waste generation through prevention measures. The assessment says that prevention of the most environmentally harmful plastic types, such as single-use plastics and non-recyclable plastic products should be prioritised. While fees on plastic shopping bags have led to notable results in reducing their use and waste in many countries, such measures should also be applied to other types of plastic products, the report says, for example to plastic packaging waste, which is the single largest plastic waste stream in Europe.\u00a0\u00a0 Plastic waste is an increasing problem around the world. \u00a0The EU has recently taken action on waste prevention, and by introducing new measures to address plastic waste and pollution, through for example the European Commission\u2019s 2018 European strategy for plastics in a circular economy and the recently adopted Single Use Plastics Directive. The European strategy notes that plastic recycling capacities have not kept pace with the increasing global production of plastics. Currently, in Europe, only 30% of plastic waste is collected for recycling. In addition, most recycling operations take place outside Europe, where environmental practices and standards may differ. The EEA assessment identified 173 waste prevention measures either implemented in countries or planned for implementation. The report is based on a review of national and regional waste prevention programmes and results from a survey conducted across 27 EU Member States (apart from Cyprus, which has not adopted a waste prevention programme), plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey. Figure 1.1: Environmental issues arising along the plastics value chain Source: EEA Other key findings: Plastic waste has been declared a priority waste stream in nearly half of the EEA member countries. Of the 173 waste prevention measures identified, 105 cover the production phase of plastic products and 69 cover the consumption phase. With the exception of national actions, such as a levy on plastic carrier bags, the majority of the identified prevention measures consist of voluntary agreements and information activities. Around 20% of the measures (i.e. 37 of the 173 measures identified) are market based instruments. Of these, the majority relate to the charging of fees to consumers for use of plastic carrier bags. A total of 30 voluntary agreements on plastic waste prevention have been started involving different sets of stakeholders in the countries reviewed. They often include specific targets that are monitored by internal or external parties. Only nine countries have explicit waste prevention targets included in their prevention programmes. Clear and coherent targets, that are helpful to drive innovation and improve waste practices, are still lacking for most product groups and thus the levels of activity and ambition differ among the countries. Good practice examples identified include both regulatory initiatives such as a ban on certain plastic products and softer measures such as stakeholder agreements to reduce the consumption of plastic products (mainly packaging), and training and capacity building. Unfortunately, there are very few cases where the adopted initiatives have been properly evaluated, making progress hard to assess.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/what-are-european-countries-doing"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0118", "date": "2019-05-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Small increase in EU\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2017, with transport emissions up for the fourth consecutive year", "text": "According to the EEA's Annual European Union greenhouse gas inventory 1990-2017 and inventory report 2019, total greenhouse gas emissions (including international aviation) rose by 0.7\u00a0% in 2017 compared with 2016. These official data confirm the preliminary estimates published by the EEA in October 2018. From 1990 to 2017, the EU reduced its net greenhouse gas emissions by 21.7 %. The EU is therefore still exceeding its 20 % reduction target set for 2020. EU greenhouse gas emissions have decreased since 1990 as a combined result of policies, economic and structural factors and, on average, milder winters (requiring less energy for heating). The largest emission cuts have been made in the energy sector, due to efficiency improvements, increased use of renewables and a less carbon intensive mix of fossil fuels \u2014 more gas, and less coal and oil. Energy efficiency and renewable energy will continue to play a key role in cutting future emissions and helping the EU achieve its 40\u00a0% reduction target by 2030. The EEA will publish preliminary estimates of 2018 emissions in the autumn. Other key findings: The 0.7\u00a0% increase in EU greenhouse gas emissions observed in 2017 resulted from the main following factors: Transport emissions continued to grow: for the fourth consecutive year since 2013, carbon dioxide emissions from road transportation increased \u2014 both for freight and passenger vehicles. Most of the increase was accounted for by higher diesel consumption by trucks and vans, but consumption and emissions also increased for passenger cars. Emissions from international aviation increased substantially as a result of higher demand and consumption of jet kerosene. Across the EU, several industrial sectors recorded higher emissions in 2017 as a result of higher economic and industrial activity compared to 2016. These increases were partly offset by improvements in the energy and carbon intensity of the economy, due to: Lower fossil-fuel consumption and emissions in the production of heat and electricity in power stations, with lower use of coal and higher use of natural gas and renewables. Lower transformation losses and better energy efficiency. Poland and Spain accounted for the largest increases in greenhouse gas emissions in absolute terms in 2017. In Poland, the increase was mainly due to higher emissions from road transportation. In Spain, the bulk of the net increase in emissions was accounted for by higher use of coal for power generation. The largest increases in relative terms in 2017 occurred in Malta, Portugal and Estonia.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/small-increase-in-eus-total-ghg"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0119", "date": "2019-05-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "New initiative to measure outdoor air quality at schools across Europe", "text": "The EEA and the European Network of the Heads of Environmental Protection Agencies (EPAs) have launched a citizen science initiative to monitor air quality around European schools. The participating schools measure nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations with reliable, simple low-cost devices, placing one sampler beside the road in front of the school and one in a less polluted area, such as the school backyard. Children at participating schools learn about air pollution and its health effects during the project. Parents also get to see how road transport affects air quality, and the project explores whether this knowledge leads parents to shift away from bringing their children to school by car. A short questionnaire will track any changes in awareness and behaviour. Participating environmental protection agencies also engage with local communities and explain how the EPAs work to improve air quality. Besides raising awareness on air quality, the initiative explores how data collected by citizens might complement official air quality data. At a European level, this can support the European Commission\u2019s efforts to streamline environmental reporting, in particular to \u2018promote the wider use of citizen science to complement environmental reporting\u2019. Background The EEA\u2019s 2018 \u2018Air quality in Europe\u2019 report showed that, while strong policies and local actions have helped decrease levels of pollution in Europe\u2019s cities, most Europeans living in urban areas still suffer from pollutant levels that are above the World Health Organization\u2019s recommendations for the protection of human health.

The report also reflects on the intrinsic value of biodiversity, which needs to be respected in addition to the economic benefits from nature. The report states that the distribution and location of ecosystems in Europe is generally stable. However, urban areas and other infrastructure are expanding at the expense of farmland and semi-natural ecosystems. For water quantity and fish biomass, the EEA has developed accounts that analyse the use of renewable water resources and marine fish stocks. Both of these are heavily exploited and need to be closely monitored. Further work is also required to better measure the condition of Europe\u2019s land and sea ecosystems. Overall, there is a clear lack of data to reliably account for the condition of European ecosystems, the EEA report states. Investments in these data are necessary for a sustainable management of Europe\u2019s natural capital. According to the report, this requires more targeted monitoring of biodiversity in combination with satellite observations and other statistical data.

The assessment is based on publicly available monitoring data, primarily collected in the context of the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The report shows that all four regional seas in Europe have a large-scale contamination problem, ranging from 96 % of the assessed area in the Baltic Sea and 91 % in the Black Sea, to 87 % in the Mediterranean and 75 % in the North-East Atlantic Ocean. The coverage of the assessed area is mostly good but it varies considerably between the four seas and remains limited in the offshore waters of the Mediterranean Sea. Overall, contamination is declining in all four seas, though the insecticide DDT appears to be at best stabilising in the Mediterranean Sea. The concentrations of some well-known contaminants, such as cadmium and mercury, appear to be declining but in many areas not enough to meet agreed thresholds. The EEA report \u00a0compares the information to seven international policy objectives related to contamination in the marine environment, showing that all the seven objectives remain unlikely to be met by 2020-2021. This includes the descriptor on contaminants that is part of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive\u2019s goal of achieving good environmental status in Europe\u2019s regional seas.

The final data show that average CO2 emissions of a new car sold in the EU rose by 0.4 g\u00a0CO2/km in 2017 to 118.5 g\u00a0CO2/km, from 118.1\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km in 2016. Although this level remains below the current target level of 130\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km, it is well above the target of 95\u00a0g CO2/km to be achieved by 2021. Since 2010, when monitoring started under current EU legislation, official emissions from new cars have decreased by 15.5% (almost 22 g\u00a0CO2/km). However, between 2015 and 2016, emissions decreased by only 1.5 g\u00a0CO2/km, which was less than half of the average annual reduction needed to reach the 2021 target. The increase in 2017 is a stark confirmation that car makers need to achieve further and faster improvements in manufacturing and promoting more efficient cars. Average CO2 emissions of new light commercial vehicles (vans) dropped by 7.5 g\u00a0CO2/km from 2016. The average new van registered in 2017 emitted 156.1 g\u00a0CO2/km. This reduction brings the EU average emissions 11\u00a0% below the 2017 target of 175 g\u00a0CO2/km and 6\u00a0% above the 2020 target. While all van manufacturers respected their specific emission targets in 2017, three car manufacturers (Automobili Lamborghini, Mazda Motor Corporation and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Automobiles Alpine),\u00a0representing together 1.4 % of all new car sales in 2017,\u00a0exceeded their specific emission targets for 2017. While certain other manufacturers, if considered individually, would have exceeded their specific emission target, they met their obligations as members of pools or thanks to derogations. Other key findings For the first year since 2009, petrol cars constituted the majority of new registrations in 2017 (almost 53\u00a0%). The proportion of electric vehicles (plug-in hybrid and battery electric cars) increased from 1.0\u00a0% in 2016 to 1.5\u00a0% in 2017. New diesel cars, which were on average around 300 kilograms (kg) heavier than new petrol cars, emitted on average 117.9\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km, which is 3.7\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km less than the average petrol car. The average fuel efficiency of new petrol cars has been constant in 2016 and 2017, whereas the fuel-efficiency of new diesel cars has worsened compared to 2016 (116.8\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km). If similar petrol and diesel segments are compared, new conventional petrol cars emitted 10-40\u00a0% more than new conventional diesel cars. For diesel cars, only the large\u2011sized segment managed to achieve a small reduction (0.5\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km) in 2017 compared with 2016. For conventional petrol cars, large-sized cars saw a significant reduction in CO2 emissions of around 6\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km, and medium/small-sized cars remained rather stable. Amongst the largest automakers, Toyota Motor Europe had the lowest average CO2\u00a0emissions for new passenger cars registered in 2017 (with 103\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km). Automobiles Peugeot and Automobiles Citroen followed with (105\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km) and (106\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km), respectively. As in every year since vans monitoring commenced, Automobile Dacia SA was the lowest-emitting vans manufacturer (118 g\u00a0CO2/km in 2017). BMW AG, Renault, Daimler AG, Volkswagen together sell more than 50\u00a0% of the new electric vehicles in the market. Post-2020 CO2 targets for cars, vans and heavy-duty vehicles In December 2018, EU lawmakers reached an agreement on emission targets for the average fleet emissions of new passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles for 2025 and 2030. These targets aim to reduce the average CO2 emissions from new cars by 15 % in 2025 and by 37.5 % in 2030, compared with 2021 baseline levels. For light-commercial vehicles, the targets consist of reductions by 15 % in 2025 and 31 % in 2030, relative to 2021. In February 2019, EU lawmakers also reached an informal agreement setting a 30\u00a0% reduction target for the average fleet emissions of new trucks by 2030. EEA activities The EEA collects and regularly makes available data on new passenger vehicles registered in Europe\u00a0in accordance with EU Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and data on new light commercial vehicles registered in Europe\u00a0in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 510/2011. The data reported by EU Member States includes information on CO2 emissions and vehicle weight. In 2019, the EEA will start collecting data on new heavy-duty vehicles in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 2018/956. Testing vehicle emissions Member States report new vehicles' CO2 emission levels, measured under standardised laboratory conditions, following the requirements of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test procedure. This procedure is designed to allow a comparison of emissions for different manufacturers. However, there is now wide recognition that the NEDC test procedure, dating from the 1970s, is outdated and does not represent real-world driving conditions and emissions due inter alia to a number of flexibilities that allow vehicle manufacturers to optimise the conditions under which their vehicles are tested. The EEA has published a non-technical guide explaining the key reasons for the differences observed between official and real world driving emissions. The 'Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure' (WLTP) has been introduced since September 2017 to decrease the divergence between laboratory test and real world emissions. For a very limited amount of records, CO2 emissions measured using WLTP are also reported.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/almost-all-car-makers-met-their"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0123", "date": "2019-03-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Better planning and methods needed to restore nature", "text": "The EEA briefing \u2018Tools to support green infrastructure planning and ecosystem restoration\u2019 looks at natural capital from the angle of building networks of natural and semi-natural areas that can help biodiversity to recover and deliver a wide range of ecosystem services.

The analysis focuses on the latest information for 2016, when around 3 600 industrial facilities reported at least one direct or indirect pollutant release to water to the E-PRTR database. Only those facilities with discharges above certain thresholds are required to submit these data. The report shows that industrial sectors with large-scale activities tend to have a higher proportion of direct releases to water, which would require more intense on\u2011site treatment. Pulp and paper, iron and steel, energy supply, non-ferrous metals and chemicals industry are examples of such sectors. Sectors with typically smaller facilities, and/or less polluted waste water, such as manufacturing and food and drink production, tend to report higher proportions of their releases to the sewer system, often similar in pollutant-loading as releases from domestic sources. The largest environmental pressures caused by direct releases of pollutants to water bodies, assessed using an eco-toxicity weighting system, comes from single large, or clusters of smaller, thermal power plants, coke ovens and chemical manufacturing plants. According to a recent EEA assessment on the state of water in Europe, only around 40 % of Europe\u2019s surface water bodies are in good ecological status and 38 % of surface water bodies have good chemical status. Based on national assessments however, in most countries large industrial sources of pollution are identified as being only a relatively small source of pollution to water bodies. The data suggest that industrial facilities not regulated by EU legislation, i.e. smaller sites, may presently exert greater pressure on the quality of water than the larger installations covered by legislation. Finally, the report identifies several further important knowledge gaps and provides a series of recommendations designed to support policy-makers and to improve the existing reporting mechanisms by UWWTP operators and European countries. \u00a0About E-PRTR The\u00a0European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR)\u00a0is the Europe-wide register that provides easily accessible key environmental data from industrial facilities in European Union Member States and in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Serbia and Switzerland.

The EEA report \u2018Europe's urban air quality \u2014 re-assessing implementation challenges in cities\u2019 analyses the implementation of EU air quality legislation at the urban level and identifies some of the reasons behind persistent air quality problems in Europe's cities. The EEA produced the new report in cooperation with 10 of 12 cities that were involved in a 2013 Air Implementation Pilot project, namely: Antwerp (Belgium), Berlin (Germany), Dublin (Ireland), Madrid (Spain), Malm\u00f6 (Sweden), Milan (Italy), Paris (France), Plovdiv (Bulgaria), Prague (Czechia) and Vienna (Austria). Five years on from the original assessment, the cities involved in the project have all improved their air quality management, particularly in their use of tools and methods to quantify the effects of proposed and implemented measures. In general, there is also an increased understanding of the sources of local air pollution. Nevertheless, cities report that a number of important challenges remain, including communicating and engaging with citizens on air quality issues, and making the case for new air quality measures, including highlighting co-benefits for health, noise reduction and climate change mitigation and adaptation. The report also shows that achieving policy coherence across administrative and governance levels is challenging, as are efforts to generate political and public support for improving air quality beyond the minimum EU standards. In the ten cities participating in the project, expanding district heating, promoting cycling, lowering speed limits and issuing congestion charges were the most common measures to improve local air quality. Other common initiatives included relocating industrial facilities, modernising household stoves and boilers, using cleaner fuels for heating, switching to cleaner buses or trams and introducing low-emission transport zones. The EEA\u2019s 2018 \u2018Air quality in Europe\u2019 report has shown that, while strong policies and local actions have helped decrease levels of pollution in Europe\u2019s cities over the past decades, most Europeans living in urban areas still suffer from pollutant levels that are above the World Health Organization\u2019s recommendations for the protection of health.

Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The EEA report \u2018Unequal exposure and unequal impacts: social vulnerability to air pollution, noise and extreme temperatures in Europe\u2019 draws attention to the close links between social and environmental problems across Europe. The distribution of these environmental threats and the impacts they have on human health closely mirror differences in income, unemployment and education levels across Europe. While EU policy and legislation over past decades have led to significant improvements in living conditions, both economically and in terms of environmental quality, regional inequalities persist. The report stresses that better alignment of social and environment policies and improved local action are needed to successfully tackle environmental justice issues. \u2018The European Commission has consistently emphasised that, on environmental issues, we are a Europe that protects. That principle is best tested by examining how we protect the vulnerable, the weak and the defenceless. The European Environment Agency is to be commended for this report that examines how the poor, the old and the very young are those most at risk from poor air quality, excessive noise and extremes of temperatures.

Source: EEA based on the E-OBS dataset (updated from Haylock et al., 2008) and Eurostat. \u00a0 Key findings Air and noise pollution Eastern European regions (including Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria) and regions in southern Europe (including Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece), where incomes and education are lower and unemployment rates higher than European averages, were more exposed to air pollutants including particulate matter (PM) and ground level ozone (O3). Wealthier regions, including large cities, tend to have on average higher levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), mostly because of the high concentration of road traffic and economic activities. However, within these regions themselves, it is still the poorer communities that tend to be exposed to higher local levels of NO2. Exposure to noise is much more localised than exposure to air pollution and ambient levels vary considerably across short distances. The analysis did find a tentative link between noise levels in cities and lower household incomes, suggesting that cities with poorer populations have higher noise levels. Extreme temperatures Southern and south-eastern European regions are more affected by higher temperatures. Many regions in Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are also characterised by lower incomes and education, higher levels of unemployment and larger elderly populations. These socio-demographic factors can reduce individuals\u2019 ability to respond to and avoid heat and thus result in negative health outcomes. In parts of Europe a large number of people are unable to keep their homes adequately warm because of poor-quality housing and the price of energy. Illnesses and fatalities associated with exposure to low temperatures continue to occur as a result. What is being done to tackle the problem? The European Union (EU) as a whole has made significant progress over past decades in reducing air pollution and Member States have implemented various EU policies to improve climate change adaptation. The EU\u2019s regional policy has proved its effectiveness in helping to address social and economic inequalities. A number of regional and city authorities are also proactive in reducing the impact of the environmental hazards on the most vulnerable members of society: Improved spatial planning and road traffic management, such as the introduction of low-emission zones in city centres, are helping to reduce exposure to air pollution and noise in areas where socially vulnerable groups live. A ban on certain domestic heating fuels, like coal, also leads to improved air quality in low-income zones. However, it needs to be combined with subsidies for switching to cleaner heating options for low-income households. Examples of actions aimed at protecting children from aircraft and road noise include provision of noise barriers and protective structures in outdoor play areas. Many national and local authorities have put action plans in place to improve emergency response to help the elderly and other vulnerable groups during heat waves or cold spells. This is often supplemented by community or voluntary sector initiatives. Climate change adaptation helps to prepare for increasingly frequent and extreme heatwaves. In particular, providing more green space helps to cool down city centres whilst bringing health and quality of life benefits to urban residents. Background on the assessment Pollution and other environmental hazards pose health risks to everyone, but have greater impacts on some people due to their age or state of health. Individuals\u2019 ability to avoid, or cope with these hazards is also influenced by their income, employment status or level of education.

The report states that, while aviation has produced economic benefits, stimulated innovation and improved connectivity within Europe, the sector's growth has also increased its negative impacts on climate change, noise and air quality. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said that \"the report confirms that the current trends and outlooks in aviation are not compatible with protecting the environment, climate and people\u2019s health. Europe must lead the way towards a more sustainable aviation sector at home and abroad. Strong policies and robust implementation can mitigate future impacts of a growing sector as well as foster innovation and the fundamental shift needed in consumer behaviour.\" Key findings of the report: The number of flights (EU28 + EFTA)\u00a0 increased by 8 % between 2014 and 2017, and is expected to grow by 42 % from 2017 to 2040 in the most-likely forecast. Technological improvements, fleet renewal and increased operational efficiency have been able to partially counterbalance the impact of recent growth, but there has still been an increase in overall noise and emissions since 2014. In 2016, domestic aviation and international aviation were together accountable for 3.6 % of the total EU28 greenhouse gas emissions and for 13.4 % of the emissions from transport. The environmental efficiency of aviation continues to improve and, by 2040, further improvements are expected in average fuel burn per passenger kilometer flown (-12 %) and noise energy per flight (-24 %). By 2040, CO2 and NOX\u00a0emissions from aviation\u00a0are expected to increase by at least 21 % and 16 %, respectively.

However, challenges remain in effectively dealing with mercury and brominated flame retardants, and with many harmful chemicals which have not been prioritised for monitoring under the EU Water Framework Directive. The report\u2019s aim is to improve understanding of which chemicals continue to pose significant risks to the environment, especially when they are present in water. It also looks at how better knowledge and understanding can help to improve controls to minimise harm. The report gives an overview of information about pollutants used in the assessment of water quality under the Water Framework Directive and describes some of the newer techniques available for assessing of water quality. Chemicals are an essential part of our daily lives and thousands of them are used on a daily basis. However, some chemicals present risks to plants and animals living in water, to the animals eating them, and to humans. Chemicals in surface waters can get there in different ways. They may have been released into the air, returning later to the earth's surface in rain or dust. They may also have been directly discharged into water from industry or urban waste water treatment plants or used in agriculture. The risks presented by some chemicals, like metals and persistent organic pollutants such as the pesticide lindane, have been recognised for decades. However, new risks presented by other chemicals, such as some pesticides or pharmaceuticals, either alone or in combination, are continually being identified. 'Cocktail effect' concerns For a number of priority substances listed under the Water Framework Directive, like cadmium, lead and nickel, and pesticides such as chlorfenvinphos and simazine, European measures towards preventing releases to the environment have been effective in significantly reducing their presence in water bodies. But the EEA report cautions that there are many more chemicals present in the environment, where better information and knowledge is needed to know whether they present a risk in lakes, rivers and other surface waters. A key concern involves micro pollutants and the so-called 'cocktail effect', whereby mixtures of single chemical substances that individually may be present at harmless concentrations can combine and pose a risk to health. In the environment, chemicals entering surface waters can mix with natural mineral salts and organic compounds, \u00a0as well as with nutrients from sewage, agricultural run-off and other waste water. Chemicals which make their way into the water from air emissions add to the mix. The report notes that the detection of several hundred organic chemicals at low concentrations in a single freshwater sample is common and the level of risk that that might present is insufficiently understood. The way ahead The report also suggests how Europe\u2019s surface water bodies could be better protected in the future. Existing EU rules provide a flexible approach for water management but do not reflect recent scientific developments in the assessment of mixtures. The report calls for more robust data reporting of chemical emissions and improving the monitoring, modelling and reporting of diffuse sources of pollution, to ensure that pressures are correctly understood and measures can be appropriately targeted. State of water and chemicals The\u00a0EEA 'state of water' report, published in July 2018,\u00a0found that only 38 % of monitored lakes, rivers and other surface water bodies are in good chemical status \u2014 with no concentrations of priority substances exceeding EU-wide environmental quality standards. In most EU Member States, only a few substances account for poor chemical status, the most common being mercury. Once widely used in thermometers, batteries and paints, mercury continues to be found in water samples with the major European source now being atmospheric pollution from coal-fired combustion plants. Other substances causing significant numbers of water bodies to fail include polybrominated diphenylethers, which were widely used as flame retardants in the 1990s and 2000s, and PAHs, which are carcinogenic substances produced by burning organic matter.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/more-action-needed-to-tackle"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0131", "date": "2018-12-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU goal on phase-down of F-gases remains on track", "text": "The EEA\u00a0report \u2018Fluorinated greenhouse gases 2018\u2019 assesses progress made under an EU-wide phase-down in the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) over the past year.

The report also tracks progress towards the global HFC phase-down under the so-called Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol which enters into force in 2019. The report gives the amount of F-gases supplied to industry and assesses both the physical amounts (in tonnes) and in amounts weighted by the global warming potential of hydrofluorocarbon gas, which is measured in CO2-equivolent tonnes (CO2e). F-gases were introduced over past decades to replace other chemicals that were found to be harmful to the earth\u2019s ozone layer. However, F-gases contribute to climate change so phasing down their use has become an important part of the EU\u2019s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Compared with 2014 levels, the F-gas Regulation aims at cutting the EU\u2019s F-gas emissions by two-thirds by 2030. Phase-down of HFCs under the EU F-Gas Regulation The EU\u2019s phase-down of F-gases is being done through a system of annual quotas allocated to producers and importers. In 2017, the EU-wide placing on the market of HFCs stayed below the overall market limit for the third year in a row, by 0.4 %. EU Contribution to the global phase-down under the Kigali Amendment The HFC 'consumption' in 2017, in terms of the Montreal Protocol definition, was 12 % below the first limit set for the EU for 2019 under the Montreal Protocol\u2019s Kigali Amendment. Other key figures: The supply (reflecting the actual use) of F-gases in the EU increased by 3 % in mass, but the overall warming effect decreased by 2 % (CO2e). \u00a0This indicates a move towards gases with lower global warming potential. Refrigeration and air conditioning continue to be key applications.

The report shows that the share of renewable energy in final energy use in the EU increased from 16.7\u00a0% in 2015 to 17.0\u00a0% in 2016 and to an estimated 17.4\u00a0% in 2017. Although the EU remains on track to achieve its 2020 target of 20 % share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption, recent increases in final energy consumption in some Member States are slowing down the pace of growth in the share of renewable energy across the EU. To meet the 2030 target, EU Member States must collectively increase the share of renewable energy sources to at least 32 % of gross final energy consumption. Currently, individual Member States\u2019 use of renewable energy varies widely, ranging from over 30\u00a0% of gross final energy consumption in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Latvia and Sweden to below 9\u00a0% in Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands, the EEA report shows. Other key findings In 2017, 85 % of all newly installed power capacity in the EU was of renewable origin, with wind power and solar photovoltaics accounting for three quarters of the new renewable power capacity. One third of all electricity consumed in the EU in 2016 and in 2017 originated from renewable sources. Heating and cooling remains the dominant market sector for renewable energy in the EU, with about 19 % share of renewables in 2016 and 2017. The transport sector is lagging far behind with only 7\u00a0% share of renewable use in the same years. Most of renewable energy used for transport comes from biofuels. Only biofuels certified to comply with the sustainability criteria under the Renewable Energy Directive can be counted towards these targets. According to the report, the EU is still the global leader in renewable electricity capacity per capita but China is now investing more in new capacity. The share of jobs related to renewable energy in the labour force is also progressing faster in Brazil and China than in the EU. The increasing use of renewables has allowed the EU to cut its demand for fossil fuels and their associated greenhouse gas emissions. According to the EEA analysis, the EU\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions would have been about 9 % higher in 2016, and 10 % higher in 2017, if the increasing use of renewables since 2005 had not substituted 11 % of the EU\u2019s gross inland consumption of fossil fuels over this period.

These new measures set a range of emission limits that Member States must use for emissions permits issued to power plant operators by 2021. The upper limits represent a minimum Member States must do while the lower limits are a reference for more ambitious targets. According to the EEA analysis, implementing the upper emission limits of the new requirements would, by 2030, result in emission cuts of 66 % for sulphur dioxide (SO2), 56 % for particulate matter and 51 % for nitrogen oxides (NOx), compared with 2016 emissions. However, in the same period, implementing the more ambitious targets would result in more substantial emission reductions of 91\u00a0% for SO2, 82\u00a0% for particulate matter and 79\u00a0% for NOx. The additional NOx emission reductions associated with achieving to the more ambitious level of implementation are, for 2030 alone, comparable to the lifetime NOx emissions of 220\u00a0000 modern (average Euro 6) diesel cars on European roads (assuming a lifetime mileage of 150\u00a0000\u00a0km).

Europe needs to urgently step up efforts to transform its key systems of production and consumption towards sustainability. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The annual EEA Environmental Indicator Report 2018 provides an updated scoreboard that monitors progress in 29 selected environmental objectives that are relevant to achieving the three key priority objectives under the\u00a07th Environment Action Programme (EAP) that address: natural capital (including biodiversity); sustainable, resource efficient, low-carbon economy; and people\u2019s health and well-being. The scoreboard paints a bleak picture for progress in improving the EU\u2019s natural capital. The overall progress is mixed for the other two priority objectives. Compared to last year\u2019s, this year\u2019s scoreboard revised downwards the prospects of meeting three more objectives, important to the achievement of the 7th EAP priority objective that addresses sustainable, resource efficient low carbon growth. The outlooks for meeting the EU\u2019s 2020 energy efficiency target and reducing the overall environmental impact of the housing sector by 2020 were revised from \u2018likely\u2019 to \u2018uncertain'. Increases in the overall energy consumption and in the household sector were the main cause. The outlook for reducing the environmental impact of the mobility sector was also revised to \u2018unlikely\u2019 as greenhouse gas emissions from transport increased. The report notes that for a number of indicators across the three 7th priority objectives the positive past trends seen in the scoreboard were mainly because of the low economic activity right after the 2008 financial crisis and that in several cases progress has slowed in recent years due to increased economic growth. \u2018The \u2018grow now, clean up later\u2019 economic model that dominates our world and which does not account for climate change, pollution or the degradation of our natural capital is unsustainable. Europe needs to urgently step up efforts to transform its key systems of production and consumption towards sustainability.\u2019 said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. The report suggests that environment and climate policy implementation needs to be stepped up across the EU to meet the 2020 objectives. The results also highlight the need for mainstreaming environmental and climate objectives further into those policy domains that contribute most to the degradation of natural capital, human health impacts, inefficient use of natural resources and climate change. These policy domains include energy supply and demand, food production and consumption, transport and mobility and urban infrastructure development.

Other key findings Protect nature and strengthen ecological resilience: the outlook to 2020 remains bleak. There continues to be a considerable negative impact on the EU\u2019s natural capital, to the point that the EU is not on track to reach almost all of the selected 2020 objectives. For example, common birds \u2013 a key indicator for biodiversity \u2013 continue to show a declining trend and over-fishing continues to be a problem. Also there are still no policies in sight to promote the necessary reductions in the rate of land take (land lost to artificial surfaces such as buildings and roads). Boost sustainable, resource- efficient, low carbon growth:\u202fthe outlook to 2020 remains mixed. The EU is on track to meet climate and renewable energy related targets for 2020, but it\u2019s uncertain that the EU will meet its energy efficiency target. Waste generation has increased, while a reduction in environmental impact of production and consumption is uncertain for the housing sector and unlikely for the food and mobility sectors. Effectively address environment-related threats to health and well-being: the outlook to 2020 remains mixed. There have been substantial reductions in emissions of air and water pollutants in recent decades but key concerns persist around air quality and noise pollution in urban areas and ammonia emissions, which arise mainly from agricultural production and increased the past three years. Chronic exposure to chemicals is also a continuing concern.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/achieving-eus-key-environmental-objectives"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0136", "date": "2018-11-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Better information needed on Europe's forests", "text": "The EEA briefing \u2018Forest dynamics and their ecological consequences\u2019 analyses the current state and changes in Europe's forest area, based on an array of medium-scale land-cover data and statistics.

Dedicated use of high-resolution satellite imagery from the EU's Earth Observation Programme, Copernicus, is a key method to overcome the current lack of data, the briefing states. These data can show changes in the forest area and management practices at the European level and provide information, for example, on the density of tree cover and forest type.

The report is based on the most recent reported and approximated data from EU Member States on greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy uptake and energy consumption. Complementing the report are updated climate and energy country factsheets. The first part of the \u2018Trends and Projections\u2019 report, which includes an assessment of progress towards the EU\u2019s climate targets, was published in October. While the EU as a whole remains on track to meet its 2020 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase renewable energy use, recent increasing trends in energy consumption need to be reversed in order to meet the 2020 targets. Renewed efforts will also be necessary to meet the 2030 climate and energy targets. Progress on renewables The uptake of renewable energy as part of the EU\u2019s energy mix resulted in a 17.4\u00a0% share of renewables in gross final energy consumption in 2017, according to preliminary EEA data. This indicates that the EU remains on track to reach its target of a renewables share of 20 % by 2020. However, the pace of increasing renewables use was only up marginally from 17.0\u00a0% in 2016. There has also been insufficient progress towards the 10\u00a0% target for renewables in the transport sector by 2020. With 2020 approaching, the trajectories needed to meet the national targets are becoming steeper. Increased energy consumption and persisting market barriers are hindering the uptake of renewables in several Member States. Preliminary EEA data for 2017 show that 20 Member States were on track to reach their individual targets on renewable energy by 2020 - a decline from 2016, when 25 countries were on track. In many countries, the slowing of progress is due to increases in total energy consumption, which caused the share of renewables in energy consumption to fall. Energy efficiency hampered by increased consumption Over the past decade, energy consumption generally decreased at a pace that could ensure the achievement of the EU\u2019s 2020 targets on energy efficiency. However, in 2015, energy consumption in the EU began to increase, and the EEA\u2019s preliminary estimates for 2017 indicate that both primary energy consumption and final energy consumption now lie above the indicative trajectory towards 2020. Notably, in 2016, growing demands for energy in the transport sector reached 33 % of final energy consumption in the EU. The continued growth in energy consumption, particularly in transport but also in other sectors, makes achieving the 2020 target increasingly uncertain. Preliminary EEA data from 2017 show that 13 Member States are expected to have increased their primary energy consumption to levels above the trajectories to their 2020 targets. That is an increase of three countries from 2016. Member States will need to increase their efforts to bring the EU back on track and reverse the trend of increasing energy consumption, in particular in the transport sector. Stepped up measures needed to meet 2030 targets New EU-wide targets are set for 2030 in the areas of greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency, namely to: \u00a0 reduce the EU\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions domestically by at least 40 % (compared to 1990 levels); increase the share of renewable energy sources to at least 32 % of gross final energy consumption; and achieve at least a 32.5 % improvement in energy efficiency (compared to the 2007 baseline). The EEA\u2019s Trends and Projections report indicates that the current trends will not be adequate to reach the 2030 targets, and additional and enhanced efforts will be necessary in the coming decade. To this end, Member States will submit by the end of 2018 their first draft national energy and climate plans, including details on climate and energy objectives and policies that that will help them achieve the 2030 targets. FIGURE ES.1 EU progress towards 2020 and 2030 targets on climate and energy \u00a0 Notes: * The energy efficiency targets for 2020 and 2030 are defined as absolute targets, set at 20 % and 32.5 % below the level in primary and final energy consumption projected for 2020 and 2030 in the European Commission's 2007 Energy Baseline Scenario. In this figure, the target is expressed as a relative change compared with 2005 levels of primary energy consumption in the EU to show the required reduction in primary energy consumption over time. The year 2005 was chosen because it is used as a base year for GHG emissions (in the EU ETS and under the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD)) and renewable energy targets; this base year is not set in the energy efficiency legislation. It also corresponds to a peak in energy consumption in the EU.The 'with existing measures' (WEM) scenario reflects existing and adopted policies and measures, whereas the 'with additional measures' (WAM) scenario considers the additional effects of planned measures reported by Member States.

Already now, across its life cycle, a typical electric car in Europe produces less greenhouse gases and air pollutants compared with its petrol or diesel equivalent. Emissions are usually higher in the production phase of electric cars, but these are more than offset by lower emissions in the use phase over time. The report confirms that the greenhouse gas emissions of electric vehicles, with the current EU energy mix and over the entire vehicle life cycle, are about 17-30 % lower than the emissions of petrol and diesel cars. However, as the carbon intensity of the EU energy mix is projected to decrease, the life-cycle emissions of a typical electric vehicle could be cut by at least 73 % by 2050. For local air quality, electric vehicles also offer clear benefits, mainly due to zero exhaust emissions at street level. However, even electric vehicles emit particulate matter from road, tyre and break wear, the report reminds. Shifting to electric vehicles could also reduce noise pollution, especially in cities where speeds are generally low and traffic often stands still. The result of the comparison is less favourable for electric cars when looking at the current impacts of their production \u00a0on ecosystems and the toxicity of the materials involved. These impacts are mostly due to the extraction and processing of copper, nickel and critical raw materials. The report suggests that these impacts could be minimised through a circular economy approach that facilitates reuse and recycling \u2014 especially of batteries. The EEA has also published a new briefing on the environmental and climate impacts of transport. According to the briefing, the sector\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have been increasing in the EU since 2014. Preliminary estimates for 2017 put EU transport emissions at 28 % above the 1990 levels, indicating that the sector is currently not on track to meet its long-term climate goals. Transport also continues to be a significant source of air pollution, especially of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide, and the main source of environmental noise in Europe, the briefing notes. Other key findings: Preliminary data show that average CO2 emissions of new passenger cars in the EU increased by 0.4 % in 2017. This was the first time the average emissions increased since the monitoring started in 2010. By contrast, average CO2 emissions from new light commercial vehicles continued to fall in 2017, showing the largest annual decrease (7.7 g CO2/km) since 2012. Registrations of battery electric vehicles increased by 51 % in 2017, comprising 0.6 % of all new registrations in the EU. Registrations of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles increased by 35 %, comprising 0.8 % of new registrations. In 2017, petrol cars became more popular (53 % of new registrations) than diesel cars (45 %) for the first time since the monitoring started. Reducing oil consumption in transport remains a challenge, and the EU's share of renewable energy in transport is still well below the 10\u00a0% target set for 2020, taking into account only biofuels complying with specific sustainability criteria. So far, only two EU Member States (Austria and Sweden) have reached the 10\u00a0% target.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/eea-report-confirms-electric-cars"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0139", "date": "2018-11-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Restoring floodplains would improve state of water, ecosystems and climate protection in Europe", "text": "The EEA briefing \u2018Why should we care about floodplains?\u2019 analyses the potential benefits of restoring natural areas next to rivers that are covered by water during floods. According to the analysis, these areas can deliver valuable cultural and ecosystem services, including a cost-effective alternative to structural flood protection. Climate change is expected to increase the number of both floods and droughts in different parts of Europe. During heavy rainfall, floodplains allow more space for the water to spread, preventing high flood waves that travel fast down the river. During dry seasons, floodplains slowly release the water they have stored, mitigating the worst impacts of droughts. Besides flood and drought protection, natural floodplains can prevent erosion, improve soil formation, purify water replenishing groundwater reservoirs and support the conservation of habitats and species, including many birds. However, the vast majority of European floodplain habitats are in either inadequate or bad conservation status, the EEA briefing states.

In terms of air pollution, road transport emissions are often more harmful than those from other sources, as these happen at ground level and tend to occur in cities, close to people. That is why it is so important that Europe redoubles its efforts to reduce emissions caused by transport, energy and agriculture and invest in making them cleaner and more sustainable, Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director Road transport is one of Europe\u2019s main sources of air pollution, especially of harmful pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter, according to the EEA \u2018Air quality in Europe \u2014 2018 report\u2019. \u00a0Emissions from agriculture, energy production, industry and households are also contributing to air pollution. The report presents the latest official air quality data reported by more than 2\u00a0500 monitoring stations across Europe in 2016. Health impacts of air pollution significant Particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ground level ozone (O3) cause the biggest harm to human health. High concentrations of air pollution continue to have a negative impact on Europeans, especially those living in urban areas. Air pollution also has considerable economic impacts, cutting lives short, increasing medical costs and reducing productivity across the economy through working days lost due to ill health. Air pollution also negatively impacts ecosystems, damaging soils, forests, lakes and rivers and reducing agricultural yields. Past and current policies and technology advances have led to slow but steady progress in reducing these negative impacts. Updated estimates in the report indicate that concentrations of PM2.5 were responsible for about 422 000 premature deaths in 41 European countries in 2015, of which around 391 000 were in the 28 EU Member States. A wider assessment included in this year\u2019s report, looking back to 1990, shows that premature deaths due to PM2.5 have been cut by about half a million premature deaths per year. This is due to the implementation of European air quality policies and the introduction of measures at national and local level which have led, for example, to cleaner cars, industry and energy production. \u2018Air pollution is an invisible killer and we need to step up our efforts to address the causes. In terms of air pollution, road transport emissions are often more harmful than those from other sources, as these happen at ground level and tend to occur in cities, close to people. That is why it is so important that Europe redoubles its efforts to reduce emissions caused by transport, energy and agriculture and invest in making them cleaner and more sustainable,\u2019 said EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx. \u2018Tackling these sectors in an integrated way can deliver clear benefits for both air quality and climate, and will help to improve our health and wellbeing.\u2019 EU Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Karmenu Vella added: 'I very much welcome this report by the European Environment Agency. It shows us that air policy does work, but it also reminds us that we need to make it work even better to achieve clean air across Europe, for all citizens. The European Commission has acted resolutely on air pollution, and will continue to work with Member States to make sure that air quality rules are fully applied on the ground.' Figure.1:\u00a0EU urban population exposed to harmful levels of air pollutant concentrations in 2014-2016 Other Key Findings Particulate Matter: For PM2.5 (particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less), the percentage of the EU-28 urban population exposed to PM2.5 stood at 6% in 2016, down from 7% the year before. But approximately 74% of the EU urban population were exposed to concentrations exceeding the stricter WHO guidelines. Exposure to PM2.5 caused the premature death of an estimated 422 000 people in 41 countries in 2015. Nitrogen dioxide: The annual limit value for NO2 continues to be widely exceeded across Europe. In 2016, 7% of the EU-28 urban population lived in areas with concentrations above the annual EU limit value and the WHO guidelines. This is down from 9% in 2015. Exposure to NO2 caused the premature death of an estimated 79 000 people across 41 European countries in 2015. Ground-level ozone: About 12% of the EU-28 urban population were exposed to O3 levels above the EU\u2019s target value in 2016, which is a considerable decrease from 2015 (30%). However, the percentage is still higher than the 7% recorded in 2014. Around 98% were exposed to levels exceeding the stricter WHO guidelines. Exposure to ozone caused the premature death of an estimated 17 700 people in 41 European countries in 2015. New EEA briefing explaining health risk assessments A briefing also published today, the \u2018EEA\u2019s health risk assessments of air pollution,\u2019 provides a detailed overview of how the EEA calculates its annual air quality health estimates that quantify the impacts of air pollution on population health. The health impacts of exposure to air pollution are diverse, ranging from inflammation of the lungs to premature deaths. In the case of the health risk assessment undertaken by the EEA, mortality is selected as the health outcome that is quantified, as it is the one for which the evidence is most robust. Mortality due to the exposure to air pollution is estimated in terms of \u201cpremature deaths\u201d and as \u201cyears of life lost\u201d. The estimated health impacts in the EEA air quality report are those attributable to exposure to PM2.5, NO2 and O3\u00a0in Europe in 2015. These estimates are based on information on air pollution, demographic data and the relationship between exposure to pollutant concentrations and specified health outcomes. The estimates provide a measure of the general impact of air pollution across a given population and for example, cannot be assigned to specific individuals living in a specific geographical location. Note on premature death estimates The impacts estimated for the different pollutants cannot be simply added to determine the estimated total health impact attributable to exposure. For example, as concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 are (sometimes strongly) correlated, the impacts estimated for these cannot be aggregated. Doing so may lead to a double counting.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/air-pollution-still-too-high"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0141", "date": "2018-10-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Increase in EU greenhouse gas emissions hampers progress towards 2030 targets", "text": "While the EU remains on track to meet its 2020 emissions reduction target, updated data shows Member States cannot afford to take progress beyond that date for granted.

Greenhouse gas emissions rise slightly across EU in 2017 According to preliminary data, emissions in 2017 across the whole EU increased by 0.6% from the year before. This corresponds to a 21.9% drop in emissions between 1990 and 2017. The slight increase prolongs a relatively stable trend in emissions observed since 2014, after a 10-year period of almost continuous reductions between 2004 and 2014. The rise is mostly due to the increase of oil consumption from road transport. The energy sector was able to reduce its emissions due to the decreasing share of coal used to produce electricity and heat in the EU. In the EU Emissions Trading System, emissions from stationary installations increased by 0.2% in 2017 from 2016. Power generation continues to drive emission reductions in the trading system. Emissions trends for industrial installations have been more variable, reflecting the economic developments observed in Europe over the last three trading periods. Aviation emissions from intra-EU flights, which are also included, grew by 4.5% in 2017 compared to the year before. The overall surplus of emission allowances continued to decline, for the third consecutive year, as a result of inter alia lower volumes of allowances being allocated for free. In 2017, emissions covered by the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) (including transport, buildings, agriculture and waste) increased for the third year in a row. The rise was mostly driven by the road transport sector. Twenty-two Member States have emitted less than their annual greenhouse gas emission targets under the ESD set for 2016. This number is estimated to have decreased to 18 Member States in 2017. While total emissions from the entire EU remain below the 2020 target, the latest projections show that greenhouse gas emissions increased in more than half (17) of the EU Member States in 2017. The largest absolute growth in emissions occurred in Spain. Poland and France also saw large growth in emissions. The largest declines compared with 2016 occurred in Denmark, Finland and the United Kingdom. Urgent action needed to achieve the EU\u2019s 2030 targets When the latest Member State projections are extended to 2030 and compared with the EU\u2019s new binding target of at least a 40% reduction in domestic greenhouse gas emissions (compared with 1990 levels) by 2030, insufficient progress is shown by a vast majority of Member States. With current national policies, the pace of reductions is expected to slow after 2020 in EU ETS and Effort Sharing sectors, instead of accelerating. According to reported projections, EU-wide reductions of emissions by 2030 will reach only 30% below 1990 levels, based on existing mitigation measures, and only 32% when additional planned mitigation measures are considered. Only six Member States project emission levels below their respective 2030 targets under the EU\u2019s Effort Sharing Regulation.

According to the report, mercury presents the biggest risk in rivers, lakes and oceans where it takes a highly toxic form that is absorbed by animals, including fish. The most recent monitoring data for water bodies shows that nearly 46 000 surface water bodies in the EU, out of approximately 111 000, are not meeting mercury levels set to protect fish-eating birds and mammals. Humans become exposed to mercury mainly when they eat large predator fish, such as tuna or monkfish, that have been eating smaller fish with mercury in their bodies. Mercury presents a particular and significant risk to the neurological development of foetuses, newborn babies and children. Current emissions of mercury in Europe are mostly limited to combustion of solid fuels, including coal, lignite and wood, the report says. However, globally mercury emissions are much higher, due to emissions from additional sources such as small-scale gold mining and industrial processes. One of the main problems with mercury is its persistency, the report explains. Once it is released into the environment, for example through coal burning, mercury can circulate through air, land, water and animals for thousands of years. The current levels of mercury in the atmosphere are up to 500 % above natural levels. In the oceans, the concentrations of mercury are about 200 % above natural levels. The report reminds that, even with immediate global action, it will take a very long time before mercury pollution declines to pre-industrial levels. As such, it is important to follow food safety advice that maximises the health benefits of eating fish while minimising exposure to mercury. In addition, consumers should pay attention to properly disposing of materials that contain mercury, such as some light bulbs and batteries, and consider alternatives to solid fuel burning for heating. The European Union has already banned or limited the use of mercury in many products and industrial processes. The Minamata Convention on Mercury, which has\u00a0as been signed by more than 120 countries and came into force in 2017, is the main global initiative to protect human health and the environment from mercury. It requires countries to put in place controls and reductions across a range of products, processes and industries where mercury is used, released or emitted.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/mercury-pollution-remains-a-problem"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0145", "date": "2018-09-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Vote for your favourite WaterPIX finalist photos", "text": "People from 34 countries around Europe sent more than 2,000 entries to the EEA\u2019s WaterPIX photo competition.

Updated aggregated data reported by companies across the 28 EU Member States showed that in 2017, more ODS controlled under the Montreal Protocol were destroyed or exported than produced or imported, a situation similar to that of 2016, according to the EEA report \u2018Ozone-depleting substances 2018\u2019. The import and production of these \u2018controlled\u2019 (i.e. covered by the Montreal Protocol) chemicals for feedstock use in the EU rose from 2016, although the emissions resulting from such use decreased. This decrease in emissions suggests that improvements have been made in the control of emissions in industry. The production of new substances, not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, remained significantly higher than the production of controlled substances. However, these new substances are comparatively far less harmful to the ozone layer than the controlled ones. Under EU rules, companies that produce these substances in the EU, import and export them into and out of the EU, as well as users of such stock, process agent users and destruction facilities, must report their activities concerning controlled substances annually. In addition to already achieving its goals on the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances under the Montreal Protocol, the EU is also reporting exempted, essential and critical uses of ODS. The EEA report is published ahead of the\u00a0International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, which is marked every year on 16 September. Background In 1989, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer entered into force. Its objective is to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out the production of ozone-depleting substances. The protocol covers over 200 individual substances with a high ozone-depleting potential, including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride (CTC), 1,1,1-Trichloroethane (TCA), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs), bromochloromethane (BCM) and methyl bromide (MB), all of which are referred to as 'controlled substances'. The Montreal Protocol was amended to regulate hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in October 2016, in Kigali, Rwanda. Both developed and developing countries have taken on mandatory commitments to reduce production and consumption of HFCs in the next three decades. Within the EU, ozone-depleting substances are covered by\u00a0Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 (known as the ODS Regulation). The EU ODS Regulation is more stringent than the rules of the Montreal Protocol and also encompasses additional substances. Stopping the use of ozone-depleting substances is crucial to protecting the ozone layer in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The ozone layer serves an important function in protecting life on Earth as it absorbs the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays, which can pose a danger to the environment and human health.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/europe-continues-to-phase-out-substances"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0147", "date": "2018-08-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Water in Europe means life, health, food, leisure, energy and more", "text": "The new 'EEA Signals 2018 \u2013 Water is life' gathers latest assessments and data to explore what is the state and future of Europe's waters. The report argues that, to ensure clean and healthy lakes, rivers and seas, we need to fundamentally change the way we use and treat water. To support this change, the European Union has put in place a number of policies to improve water quality and reduce pressures on Europe's water bodies. Currently, economic activities in Europe use on average around 243 000 cubic hectometres of water annually. Most of this water returns directly to the environment but often with impurities or pollutants, including hazardous chemicals. At the same time, the state of Europe's seas is dire, mainly due to overfishing and climate change. Rivers, lakes and wetlands suffer from excess nutrients and altered habitats. Chemical pollution negatively affects both freshwater and marine environments. Signals 2018 looks at water as a part of Europe's economy as well as a home and a vital resource for animals and plants. The report also takes a closer look at water in cities, the plastic waste problem, and the impacts of climate change. Two interviews show ways of dealing with the risks of too much water, in the Netherlands, and too little water, in Malta. The final article presents different polices and models to govern water bodies and their resources across geopolitical borders. The EEA Signals is an annual, easy-to-read report that looks at key issues related to environment and climate. Recent EEA Signals reports have looked at energy (2017), transport (2016), climate change (2015), and well-being (2014).

According to the report, the increasing demand for food, feed, biomaterials and bioenergy resources could worsen the over-exploitation of natural resources. By extending the lifetime of products and recycling materials, a circular, bio-economy approach can help retain material value and functionality for longer time as well as avoid unrecycled biowaste. Promising innovations and strategies for circular biomass use include biorefinery, 3D printing with bioplastics, multi-purpose crops, better use of residues and food waste, and biowaste treatment. Consumers can also contribute to bioeconomy's sustainability, for example, by eating less animal-based protein, preventing food waste and separating biowaste from other waste streams, the report says. The report argues that biobased approaches should be tailored to the specific use context in order to maximise the benefits of biobased and biodegradable products. The technological innovation, covering product and infrastructure design, should be embedded in a wider system innovation that also tackles consumer behaviour, product use and waste management. 'The circular economy and the bioeconomy \u2014 Partners in sustainability' is the third EEA report on the circular economy that aims to support the framing, implementation and evaluation of European circular economy policy from an environmental perspective.

The EU legislation restricts emissions for four key air pollutants from 2010 onward; nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and ammonia (NH3), and from 2020 also for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Six EU Member States exceeded ceilings for one or more pollutants in 2016. Austria and Ireland exceeded ceilings for NOx and NH3. Croatia, Germany and Spain exceeded their ceiling for NH3. Hungary exceeded its ceiling for NMVOCs. The NEC Directive allows Member States to \u2018adjust\u2019 the reported emissions in their inventories downwards for compliance checking with the emission ceilings if certain conditions are met. The numbers of exceeded ceilings described in the EEA\u2019s briefing will be lower if the applications received from countries are officially approved by the European Commission later in 2018. The EEA briefing also includes an update of projected emissions reported by EU Member States for 2020 and 2030 under the NEC Directive in relation to their individual reduction commitments set in the NEC Directive for these years. A separate EEA report on updated data from the annual European Union emission inventory report 1990-2016 under the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP)\u00a0shows that for the third consecutive year, ammonia emissions have increased \u2014\u00a0by 0.4% between 2015 and 2016. The overwhelming majority of NH3 emissions come from Europe\u2019s agriculture sector. Emissions increased in 15 EU Member States with Italy, the United Kingdom and Ireland reporting the highest increases. Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx) dropped by 3.7% and 15.1%, respectively, across the EU, according to the EEA report, which tracks the emissions of key air pollutants over past years. The report is also submitted by the EU to the UNECE under the requirements of the Gothenburg Protocol to the LRTAP Convention, which aims to limit, and as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution. The protocol also sets emission \u2018ceilings\u2019 or limits for a range of air pollutants that have to be met from 2010 onwards, which for Member States are either equivalent to or less ambitious than those specified for 2010 in the European Union NEC Directive. Air pollution is the single largest environmental risk to human health in Europe, causing respiratory problems and shortening lifespans. Poor air quality caused by air pollution can also harm vegetation and sensitive ecosystems. Moreover, several air pollutants also contribute to climate change. Air Quality measures assessed in new EEA briefing In general, the road transport sector is the largest contributor to total nitrogen dioxide emissions in the EU, while fuel combustion in the commercial, institutional and households sector is the largest contributor to total primary particulate matter emissions, particularly in some eastern European countries. Encouraging the use of cycling, improving public transport and shifting to less polluting fuels are some of the top measures EU Member States are using to reduce emissions and impacts of those two most harmful air pollutants, according to a second new EEA briefing\u00a0\u2018Improving Europe\u2019s air quality \u2013 measures reported by countries\u2019 published today. Transport and, more specifically, traffic-related measures are the key focus of Europe-wide efforts to improve air quality, according to the briefing. Almost 50% of the total number of measures used in tackling\u00a0particulate matter reported by Member States target road transport, followed by commercial and residential combustion sectors, and industry. For nitrogen dioxide, more than 60% of the measures reported mainly target the road transport sector. Industry and the commercial and residential combustion sectors are the second and third most targeted sectors. The briefing complements the EEA\u2019s annual air quality report, an updated version of which will be published later in 2018. While air quality in Europe is slowly improving, high concentrations of air pollution still have significant health impacts on Europeans. Particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ground-level ozone are the pollutants that cause the biggest harm to health.

The report, \u2018National policies and measures on climate change mitigation in Europe in 2017\u2019, the first related briefing, \u2018Tracking climate policies in European Union countries\u2019, and the EEA database on climate change mitigation policies and measures in Europe\u00a0together give an overview of more than 1\u00a0500 national policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the EU.\u00a0Member States report this information every two years under the EU climate monitoring mechanism.\u00a0The EEA collects this information, checks its quality, and makes it publicly available. According to the analysis, Member States\u2019 policies and measures to cut emissions primarily target energy efficiency, renewable energy, and vehicle emissions. Most reported policies and measures are economic, such as direct subsidies or feed-in tariffs, or regulatory, such as energy efficiency standards. Three out of four (74%) national policies and measures had a direct link to EU legislation. Member States\u2019 reports often lack quantitative information on the effects and costs of their policies. In 2017, only nine Member States reported information on the emission reductions over a mere 65 policies and measures. This means that there is not enough information to calculate the exact impacts of current national mitigation policies across the EU, the EEA report warns.\u00a0\u00a0Such information must be reported by Member States, where it is available. The second EEA briefing \u2018Using Member States information on policies and measures to support policy making: energy efficiency in buildings\u2019 shows that, currently, it is necessary to combine several different sources of information to properly analyse the effectiveness of individual measures, or the aggregate impact of sectoral measures, in curbing emissions. The briefing reminds that effective evaluation of current policies is important because it supports better and more informed decision-making for future policies. Official emissions data, recently published by the EEA, show that the 28 EU Member States have jointly reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 22.4 % from 1990 to 2016.

This is critical to the long-term sustainability of our waters and in meeting our long-term goals of living well within the limits of our planet. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director EU Member States have made marked efforts to improve water quality, by improving wastewater treatment and lowering the runoff of pollutants from farmland, according to the EEA report \u2018European waters \u2014 assessment of status and pressures 2018\u2019. Measures have also been taken to make barriers passable to migrating fish and restore degraded aquatic ecosystems. While Europe\u2019s ground water bodies, like aquifers, are in good health in most cases, only 40% of monitored lakes, rivers, estuaries and coastal waters achieved the \u00a0the EU Water Framework Directive\u2019s\u00a0minimum \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018high\u2019 ecological status during the 2010-2015 monitoring period, according to the report. The last EEA assessment in 2012 found a similar level of water bodies meeting \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018high\u2019 ecological status. The EEA assessment also looked at the quantitative state and over-abstraction of Europe\u2019s groundwater and the overall chemical status of water bodies. The EEA report gives an updated health check on over 130,000 surface and groundwater bodies monitored by EU Member States, based on the data collected and reported from more than 160 so-called River Basin Management Plans covering the period 2010 to 2015. \u2018Thanks to the implementation of European water legislation in the Member States, the quality of Europe\u2019s freshwater is gradually improving, but much more needs to be done before all lakes, rivers, coastal waters and groundwater bodies are in good status. Tackling pollution from agriculture, industry and households requires joint efforts from all water users throughout Europe,\u2019 said Karmenu Vella, EU Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. \u2018We must increase efforts to ensure our waters are as clean and resilient as they should be \u2014 our own well-being and the health of our vital water and marine ecosystems depend on it.

The EEA water assessment is the second since 2012. Knowledge of Europe\u2019s waters has grown significantly since then, providing a better understanding of the status, the problems that lead to failure in achieving \u2018good status\u2019 and the measures implemented to generate improvement. The EEA report complements a forthcoming European Commission report, which will assess to what extent the Member States comply with the Water Framework Directive. This Directive sets out a framework on how to assess, manage, protect and improve water quality across the EU. It requires Member States to produce River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) as well as a Programme of Measures to improve water quality. Percentage of surface water bodies in less than good ecological status by River Basin Districts\u00a0 Note: Percentage based on known ecological status or potential (without unknown status).\u00a0 Caution is needed when comparing results between Member States, as the results can be significantly affected by the methodology applied by individual Member States. Other key findings Compared to surface waters, groundwater sources generally have the best status. Good chemical status has been achieved for 74% of the groundwater area, while 89 % of the area achieved good quantitative status. The reasons for not meeting the minimum targets were mostly due to contamination of water sites by nitrates from agricultural run-off, salt intrusion, and the seeping of hazardous chemicals from contaminated sites (e.g. industrial sites, mining areas or waste storage). Northern Scandinavia, northern United Kingdom (Scotland) and Estonia, as well as Slovakia, Romania, and several river basin districts in the Mediterranean region show a high proportion of surface water bodies in high or good ecological status. In contrast, many of the central European river basin districts, with higher population density and more intensive agriculture, show the highest proportion of water bodies failing to achieve good ecological status. Only 38% of monitored lakes, rivers and other surface water bodies are in good chemical status \u2014 with concentrations of pollutants not exceeding environmental quality EU-wide standards. In most Member States, a few substances account for poor chemical status, the most common being mercury. Once widely used in thermometers, batteries, and paints, mercury continues to be found in water samples, followed by cadmium, which is used in phosphate fertilisers and in metal production. The Water Framework Directive and RBMPs have significantly improved water management across the EU. Many Member States have invested in better ecological and chemical monitoring programmes, with more monitoring sites, more quality elements assessed and more chemicals analysed. This has led to increased availability of information and provides a much better understanding of status and pressures. The Water Framework Directive has also generated a substantial effort across EU Member States to reduce sources of pollution from agriculture, industry and households, as well as in a more natural flow of rivers and the removal of obstacles to fish migration, generating benefits for nature and protection against floods.\u00a0 EU water quality target Achieving good status involves meeting certain standards for the ecology, chemistry and quantity of waters. Ecological status is the best overall indicator of how healthy a body of water is. It takes into account how pollution, habitat degradation, climate change, and other pressures like the number of man-made dams impact the quality of the water. The top pressures responsible hindering progress\u00a0 in meeting the EU targets include barriers like dams, land reclamation, and channelization, which change the flow of rivers or streams; diffuse source pollution like farm run-off; and point source pollution such as waste water discharge from sewers. The main impacts on surface water bodies are nutrient enrichment, chemical pollution and altered habitats due to morphological changes. Monitoring and reporting are the main tools used to classify the health of EU waters. EU Member States define the status based on a scale from high, good, and moderate to poor and bad status for surface waters and two classes, good or poor, for groundwater. Monitoring is meant to track the effectiveness of measures to clean up water bodies and achieve the EU\u2019s \u2018good status\u2019 target. EU Member States are currently in their second monitoring and reporting cycle (2015-2021) under the EU Water Framework Directive. This round includes 89,000 rivers, 18,000 lakes, 13,000 groundwater sites, and 3,600 coastal and estuary waters.

Reusing products means using them again for their original purpose, hence retaining more of the products\u2019 value, compared with, for example, recycling the product for raw materials. The report shows that 18 of the 33 reviewed waste prevention programmes have explicit objectives for the reuse of products. However, most frequently cited measures to promote reuse are voluntary. Only 10% of the programmes include regulatory measures and 8% cite economic instruments. Moreover, only two of the reviewed waste prevention programmes have quantitative targets for reuse. Promoting reuse often requires detailed technical insight in production processes and consumption patterns. Measures include setting standards for eco-design aimed at easy disassembly and reuse of components, subsidising repair facilities to balance labour costs, and eco-labelling and public procurement to influence consumption patterns. These measures often address specific types of products and activities, including construction and demolition, electrical and electronic equipment, packaging, or other products, such as vehicles. Overall, reuse remains a niche activity for most products, the report notes. Upscaling is hampered by the increasing complexity of products and shorter innovation cycles, which lead to a rapid loss of product value. In contrast, reuse businesses and consumer-to-consumer trade of products such as clothing, children\u2019s toys, furniture, are increasing due to better marketing channels on the internet and social media.

From 1990 to 2016, the EU has reduced its net greenhouse gas emissions by 22.4 %, surpassing its 20 % reduction target by 2020. These figures include emissions from international aviation, which are covered by EU targets but not accounted in national totals under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Agency's Briefing 'Trends and drivers in greenhouse gas emissions in the EU in 2016', also published today, shows that the emission decrease in 2016 was mainly due to using less coal to produce heat and electricity. Greenhouse gas emissions from road transport increased for the third year in a row. Emissions in the residential and commercial sector also increased because the winter of 2016 was slightly colder than the winter of 2015. GHG emissions by sector in the EU-28 EU greenhouse gas emissions have decreased since 1990 as a combined result of policies, economic factors and, on average, milder winters, the EEA analysis shows. The largest emission cuts have been made in the energy sector, due to energy efficiency improvements, an increased use of renewables and a less carbon intensive mix of fossil fuels \u2013 more gas, less coal and oil. Although the 2016 developments are positive, there are already indications that EU greenhouse gas emissions increased in 2017, the EEA analysis warns. The EEA will publish preliminary estimates of 2017 emissions in the autumn.\u00a0 Other key findings: The 0.4 % decrease in EU greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 occurred while the EU's gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 2.0 %.\u00a0Emissions are expected to decrease further as GDP per capita increases, showing that a growing economy and addressing climate change can go hand in hand.\u00a0 The United Kingdom and Spain accounted for the largest decreases in GHG emissions in absolute terms in the EU in 2016. Reductions in those countries were largely because of lower consumption of solid fuels (mainly coal) in the power sector. There was a relatively large increase in emissions in Poland, particularly in the road transport sector. Emissions covered by the EU emissions trading system (ETS) decreased in 2016, in particular for the energy supply sector (mostly electricity and heat production) and the industry sector (mostly iron and steel). The decrease in the power sector was the result of a sharp decline in coal consumption. Based on Eurostat data, there was a decline in nuclear electricity generation. This was more than offset by the increase in the use of renewable energy sources. Compared with 1990, the EU economy uses less energy, and does so more efficiently, and with lower greenhouse gas emissions. Improved energy efficiency will continue to play a key role in cutting future emissions but further efforts will also be needed to achieve the EU's joint 40 % reduction target by 2030.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/small-cut-in-eus-total"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0157", "date": "2018-05-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Good news for holiday makers: excellent water quality at vast majority of European bathing sites", "text": "Reducing water pollution benefits the well-being of European citizens but also animals and plant life. But we cannot be complacent. Keeping our bathing water clean requires our sustained attention by policy makers. That is why regular monitoring and assessment of bathing sites remains a crucial task. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director Nearly all 21.801 bathing water sites monitored last year across Europe, of which 21.509 were in the 28 EU Member States (95.9%), met the minimum quality requirements under EU rules according to the report by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Commission. Albania and Switzerland also monitored and reported on the quality of their 292 bathing water sites. Specific results from monitoring showed a small drop in EU sites meeting the highest 'excellent' and the minimum quality requirements set out by the EU's Bathing Water Directive. 'Excellent' quality standards across Europe dropped marginally from 85.5% in 2016 to 85% last year. Similarly those meeting minimum 'sufficient' standing fell from 96.3% to 96.0%. The reason for the slight drop was due mostly to the effect of summer rain on test results as well as changes in testing methodology in Romania and Sweden. The number of overall 'poor' rated sites remained mostly unchanged from 2016 across the EU, Albania and Switzerland, dropping from 1.5% in 2016 to 1.4% in 2017. Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, said: \"The quality of our bathing water is a source of pride for Europeans. That quality is due to good cooperation and constant vigilance. We all play a part: industry, local authorities and services together with citizens. We are happy to report that the European spirit of cooperation on bathing water is alive and continues to deliver for our citizens. When you add in our recently proposed measures to keep plastics out of our seas, it really has been a good year for European seas, beaches and lakes.\" Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \"Reducing water pollution benefits the well-being of European citizens but also animals and plant life. But we cannot be complacent. Keeping our bathing water clean requires our sustained attention by policy makers. That is why regular monitoring and assessment of bathing sites remains a crucial task.\" Europe's bathing water quality has vastly improved over the last 40 years, when the EU's Bathing Water Directive was introduced. Effective monitoring and management introduced under the directive led to a drastic reduction in untreated or partially treated municipal and industrial waste water ending up in water.\u00a0 As a result, more and more bathing water sites are not only meeting the minimum quality standards, but have also improved their quality to the highest standards. Alongside this year's report, the EEA has also released an updated interactive map showing the performance of each bathing site. Updated country reports are also available here as well as more information on the directive. Figure ES1: Proportion of bathing water sites with excellent water quality in European countries Other key findings: In five countries, 95% or more of bathing waters were assessed as being of excellent quality: Luxembourg (all 12 reported bathing waters), Malta (98.9% of all sites), Cyprus (97.3% of all sites), Greece (95.9% of all sites) and Austria (95.1% of all sites). All reported bathing water sites in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Romania, Slovenia and Switzerland achieved at least sufficient quality in 2017 (in accordance with the minimum quality standards set by the Bathing Water Directive). The three countries with the highest numbers of bathing water sites of 'poor' water quality were Italy (79 bathing water sites or 1.4%), France (80 sites or 2.4%) and Spain (38 sites or 1.7%). In the EU Member States, the highest proportion of bathing waters classified as \u00a0'poor'\u00a0 was recorded in Estonia (four bathing waters or 7.4%), Ireland (seven bathing waters or 4.9%) and the United Kingdom (21 bathing waters or 3.3%).\u00a0 Background The contamination of water by faecal bacteria continues to pose a risk to human health, especially if it is found at bathing water sites. Swimming at contaminated beaches or lakes can result in illness. The major sources of pollution are sewage and water draining from farms and farmland. Such pollution increases during heavy rains and floods due to sewage overflow and polluted drainage water being washed into rivers and seas. All EU Member States, plus Albania and Switzerland, monitor their bathing sites according to the provisions of the EU's Bathing Water Directive. The assessment of the bathing water quality under the Bathing Water Directive makes use of the values of two microbiological parameters: Intestinal enterococci and Escherichia coli. The legislation specifies if the bathing water quality can be classified as 'excellent', 'good', 'sufficient' or 'poor', depending on the levels of faecal bacteria detected. Where water is classified as 'poor', Member States should take certain measures, like banning bathing or posting a notice advising against it, providing information to the public, and taking suitable corrective actions.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/good-news-for-holiday-makers"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0158", "date": "2018-05-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Environmental pressures from industry\u2019s heavy metal pollution decreasing", "text": "A new EEA briefing on emissions of eight key heavy metals \u2013 arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel and zinc \u2013 from large industrial facilities in Europe show a rapid decline in their associated environmental pressures. From 2010 to 2016, environmental pressures caused by industrial emissions to air decreased by 39% while pressures caused by emissions to water decreased by 34%. Reducing concentrations of heavy metals in air, water and soil is important because of these substances\u2019 potential harm to people and eco-systems. Harmful effects of heavy metals include, for example, disrupting nutrient cycles in plants, and causing development and reproduction disorders in animals and humans. For emissions to air, just 18 out of 978 industrial facilities were responsible for more than half of the environmental pressures linked to heavy metal pollution from large industry in Europe in 2016. According to the data, metal production and processing were responsible for about 58% of these pressures, often originating from combustion gases released to air when heating or melting metal. Thermal power stations accounted for another 23% of the pressures. For emissions to water, mining activities accounted for 19% and intensive aquaculture for 14% of the total pressures to water. In intensive aquaculture, copper and zinc leak into the sea from fish cages where the metals are used to protect them from corrosion and growth of marine organisms. The EEA analysis uses new data published in the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) together with the UEStox model, which is an established method to estimate the eco-toxicity of pollutant releases. Combining data on emission quantities with information on the toxicity of the substance in question provides an indication of the relative environmental harm caused by releases of these substances from each facility.

This reduction brings the EU average emissions 10.9% below the 2017 target of 175 g CO2/km. This target was already met in\u00a02013. Further efficiency improvements of 6% are still needed to reach the EU's more stringent target of 147 g CO2/km set for 2020. Key findings In 2017, almost 1.6 million new vans were registered in the EU as in 2016. Higher sales in Sweden (+48%), Czech Republic (+26%) and Slovenia (+20%) were balanced by lower sales in Croatia (-27%), Hungary (-16%), Ireland (-13%), Poland (-12%) and United Kingdom (-10%). Two out of three new vans (64%) registered in the EU were sold in just four Member States: the United Kingdom (20%), France (19%), Germany (15%) and Italy (10%). The average fuel-efficiency of new vans varied widely across Member States due to the different models and sizes of vehicles sold in each country. As last year, average emissions were lowest in Portugal (133.2 g CO2/km), Cyprus (133.4 g CO2/km) and Bulgaria (134.9 g CO2/km) and highest in the Czech Republic (173.6 g CO2/km), Slovakia (170.1 g CO2/km) and Germany (169.2 g CO2/km). The average weight of new vans sold in 2017 also varied across countries. Smaller vehicles were sold in Malta, Cyprus and Portugal (< 1 570 kg); larger vehicles (>1 950 kg) in Slovakia, Czech Republic and Finland. There is now an increasing number of electric and plug-in hybrid van models available on the EU market. Registrations of such vehicles increased by 32% in 2017, compared with previous year, representing 0.8% of the total EU van sales. However, this is significantly lower than electric and plug-in hybrid passenger cars' 1.5 % share of total car sales in the same year. Diesel vehicles continue to make up the vast majority of the new van fleet, constituting 96% of sales. Background The EEA collects and regularly publish data on new light commercial vehicles registered in Europe, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 510/2011. The data reported by all Member States in order to evaluate the efficiency of the new vehicle fleet includes information on CO2 emissions and vehicle weight. It has not yet been confirmed whether different manufacturers have met their own specific annual target for 2017, based on the average weight of the vans they sold. The EEA will publish the final data and the European Commission will confirm manufacturers' individual performances in the autumn. Testing vehicle emissions Member States report new vehicles' CO2 emission levels, measured under standardised laboratory conditions, following the requirements of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test procedure. This procedure is designed to allow a comparison of emissions for different manufacturers. However, in recent years it has been widely recognised that the NEDC test procedure, developed in the 1970s, is out-dated and does not necessarily represent real-world driving conditions and emissions due inter alia to a number of flexibilities that have allowed vehicle manufacturers to optimise the conditions under which their vehicles are tested.

Combined, the relative share of PHEV and BEV sales was highest in Sweden, Belgium and Finland, reaching 5.5 %, 2.7 % and 2.6 \u200a% respectively of national car sales in 2017. The average mass of new cars sold in the EU (1 390 kg) remained broadly the same as in previous years. The mass of a vehicle is one of the key factors affecting emissions. The average diesel car sold was 283 kg heavier than the average petrol car, 20 kg less than in 2016. While the average mass of diesel cars remained constant in the last two years, the average weight of petrol cars increased by 27 kg. On average, the heaviest cars were sold in Sweden (1 540 kg), Austria and Luxembourg (1 502 kg) whereas Maltese, Greek and Danish buyers on average preferred the lightest cars (1 211, 1 243 and 1 279 kg respectively).

The study found that consumers more readily purchased lower emitting cars where sufficiently large and targeted taxes and incentives were in place. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector is a key priority for the European Union. Average CO2 emissions of new passenger cars in the EU has fallen steadily over recent years, decreasing by around 30% since 2001. However, a further 20% reduction in average CO2 emissions will be required to comply with the EU's 2021 target of 95 g CO2/km. Later this month, the EEA will publish new official statistics of the average CO2 emissions from new passenger vehicles for 2017. Source: EEA, 2018 Promoting sales of hybrids and electric cars The number of countries offering incentives promoting the use of hybrids and battery electric vehicles has jumped considerably from 2010 to 2016. All but one (Poland) have incentives for hybrid and battery electric vehicles. Norway has the highest number of incentives promoting electric vehicles, which reflects the average low emissions level in Norway and the high proportion of battery e-cars in use in 2016. The briefing warns that to foster the uptake of electric vehicles, more charging facilities are needed to reassure people on reliability and range limitation concerns on using battery-powered cars. The study notes that only 11 countries had specific incentives in place to foster more charging facilities for battery-powered cars in 2016. Emissions from trucks, buses, on the rise Trucks, buses and coaches are responsible for around one quarter of CO2 emissions from the transport sector and are expected to increase further if new measures to curb emissions are not taken, according to a separate EEA briefing also released today. Heavy duty vehicles are currently responsible for around 27% of road transport CO2 emissions. They have increased by 25% since 1990, the briefing 'Carbon dioxide emissions from Europe's heavy-duty vehicles' says. Without additional actions to curb emissions, they are expected to rise in the future, by up to 10 % in 2030 compared with 2010. Trucks or transport lorries make up the largest share of heavy duty vehicles on which includes vehicles used for the transport of goods exceeding 3.5 tonnes as well as buses or coaches used for passenger transport that have more than eight seats. There is currently no breakdown of data between trucks, buses and coaches. To date, there have been no mandatory EU procedures to monitor and report emissions and fuel consumption from heavy duty vehicles unlike those in place for new passenger cars and vans. However, a new monitoring and reporting system will come into force in 2019. This will help promote more efficient heavy-duty vehicles on the EU market. A European Commission proposal to establish mandatory CO2 emission limits for newly registered heavy-duty vehicles is expected later this year.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/tax-breaks-and-incentives-make"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0167", "date": "2018-03-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "World Water Day: Turning to nature for solutions", "text": "For centuries, we have polluted and altered European inland waterways to enable agriculture and urbanisation, produce energy, and protect against flooding. Rivers have been dammed and dikes and levees have been built to constrain the flow of water and better protect vulnerable land. These activities have, however, resulted in poor water quality and altered habitats, with significantly severe impacts on water ecosystems. Climate change will also have an impact, increasing water temperatures, and the chances of flooding, droughts and water scarcity. In many cases, nature can offer better and more cost-effective solutions to address these challenges. For example, restoring wetlands and floodplains can help prevent flooding. Adapting to climate change through water conservation plans, like reducing water consumption can help mitigate droughts. Promoting habitat networks and planting more trees by creating more green areas in cities can help absorb carbon dioxide pollution. Ensuring our rivers, lakes, creeks and ponds stay healthy, with a good ecological status is also important. Good status will increase the resilience of our ecosystems, bolster and their capability to absorb additional adverse pressures. Cleaner water is also key to human health. In recent years, European countries have adopted measures to improve the situation. Public funds and improved European Union policies on water, agriculture, and climate change are the driving force behind more sustainable and lower investment \u2018green-options\u2019 to address the challenges posed by flooding.

An updated EEA indicator on urban waste water treatment shows that treatment in all parts of Europe continues to improve. The proportion of the population connected to waste water treatment plants in northern European countries has been above 80% since 1995, with more than 70% of urban waste water receiving tertiary, or a third round of treatment. This last round of treatment is used to remove nutrients. In central European countries, connection rates have increased since 1995 and are now at 97%, with about 75% receiving tertiary treatment. The proportion of the population connected to urban waste water treatment in southern, south-eastern and eastern Europe is generally lower than in other parts of Europe, but has increased over the last 10 years with levels now at about 70%.

For each of the five perspectives, the papers explore the conceptual background and understanding of how systemic changes occur, presenting their strengths and weaknesses and their implications for governance.\u00a0 Responding to environmental challenges In its most recent five-yearly report on the European environment (SOER 2015) the EEA concluded that achieving Europe\u2019s long-term sustainability goals will require fundamental transitions of the consumption-production systems that drive environmental degradation. As highlighted in the five papers in the report, these systems are tied in complex ways to jobs and investments, policies and institutions, social norms and traditions. Collectively, these inter-linkages can mean that it is often very hard to achieve the needed changes and reforms through business as usual actions. From their contrasting analytical approaches, the five papers offer shared insights into how transitions could be achieved. While emphasising that governments alone cannot start and steer transitions, they highlight the essential role of policy and public institutions in supporting local experimentation and learning, upscaling and reconfiguration.

Aviation and shipping is the focus of the latest EEA \u2018Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism (TERM)\u2019 report. The two sectors have seen tremendous growth over past years amid a boost in economic growth, which has stimulated international trade and travel. However, the sectors have come under increased scrutiny over their rising emissions and how they can meet European Union decarbonisation goals. By 2050, global aviation and shipping together are anticipated to contribute almost 40 % of global carbon dioxide emissions unless further mitigation actions are taken. Further, transport, including aviation and shipping, continues to be a significant source of air pollution. It is also the main source of environmental noise in Europe and contributes to a range of environmental pressures on ecosystems. Shifting to greener air and sea transport The two transport sectors face complex challenges in reducing their environmental impacts. The report notes that in many ways the sectors are locked into established ways of operating which can be difficult to change. For example, past investments in conventional airport and seaport infrastructure can delay the uptake of more sustainable technologies and opportunities to encourage alternative cleaner modes of transport like rail, for shorter trips. Similarly, the long lifespan of airplanes and vessels can hamper a faster shift to cleaner technologies. Other hurdles to be overcome include the lack of research on cleaner fuels for both aircraft and ships as well as the costs involved in producing them. The international aviation and maritime sectors also benefit from significant tax exemptions on fossil-based fuels, which can act as a further barrier to change. Measures to reduce transport\u2019s future impacts on the environment also need to take a holistic perspective and consider how demand for conventional transport services can effectively be managed in the context of overall sustainable development. The TERM report highlights the opportunities available to the sectors to lessen their environmental impact. It stresses that governments have a key role to play by supporting investment in research, product standards and subsidies for new emerging technologies and to spur the sharing of data and information on the viability of new technologies. Efforts to promote debate on sustainable travel and consumer behaviour and changes to lifestyles and transport habits can also help in the long term to reduce carbon emissions and other impacts associated with aviation and shipping. Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism (TERM) The EEA\u2019s annual TERM reports use the latest available European data in order to assess key trends, measures and overall progress of the transport sector towards its environmental policy targets. Each year, the reports also address a specific issue. An indicator-based TERM briefing was also published by the EEA at the end of 2017, highlighting the mixed progress of Europe\u2019s transport sector in meeting its environment, health and climate policy targets. Diesel remains king of the road The use of diesel fuel continues to dominate across the EU, according to the second report \u2018Fuel quality in the EU in 2016\u2019, also published today. In 2016, 71.8 % (257 206 million litres) of fuel sales in the EU was diesel and 28.2 % (100 838 million litres) was petrol. Diesel sales increased by 3.8 % from 2015, whereas petrol sales remained almost unchanged.

The findings largely confirm preliminary data the EEA published for cars and vans last year. They show that new passenger cars sold in the EU in 2016 had CO2 average emissions of 118.1\u00a0grams (g) CO2/kilometre (km), which is 28\u00a0% lower than in 2004 when monitoring started, and lower by 1.2 % only, when compared with 2015. The average emissions from vans sold in 2016 were 163.7\u00a0g CO2/km, below the 2017 target of 175\u00a0g CO2/km and a reduction of 9.2\u00a0% since monitoring first started. In order to meet their respective future targets, (95\u00a0g CO2/km for cars by 2021 and 147\u00a0g CO2/km for vans by 2020), average CO2 emissions for new cars and vans will need to continue decreasing at a similar pace. Data on manufacturer's individual performances show that all car and van manufacturers met their CO2 specific emission targets in 2016. While certain manufacturers would have exceeded their specific emission target, if considered individually, they met their obligations as members of pools. Other key findings Conventional diesel and petrol cars accounted for a large majority of new sales in 2016 (96.5\u00a0%). However, for the first time since 2009, the share of diesel vehicles dropped below half of all new passenger car registrations. However, they remained the most sold vehicles in Europe, making up 49.5 % of sales. The proportion of plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles remained largely the same as in 2015, making up around 1\u00a0%. For vans, the vast majority of vehicles are fuelled with diesel (96 %). Diesel cars, which on average are around 300\u00a0kilograms (kg) heavier than petrol cars, emitted on average 116.8\u00a0g CO2/km. This is 4.9\u00a0g CO2/km less than the average for petrol cars. In 2000, the emission difference between diesel and petrol cars was much larger, exceeding 17\u00a0g CO2/km \u2013 the average efficiency advantages of diesel vehicles continue to decrease. Amongst the largest car manufacturers, Automobiles Peugeot (102\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km) and Automobiles Citroen (103\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km) had the lowest average CO2 emissions for new passenger cars registered in 2016, while Toyota Motor Europe had the highest percentage of new vehicles having emissions below 95 g\u00a0CO2/km (44 %). The largest reductions in average emission levels of passenger cars in the last year were achieved by Jaguar Land Rover Limited (a reduction of 14.2\u00a0g CO2/km) and Chrysler (12.1\u00a0g CO2/km). As in each year since vans monitoring commenced, Automobile Dacia SA was the lowest-emitting vans manufacturer (124 g CO2/km in 2016). Among van manufacturers in 2016, Ford Motor Australia reduced its average emissions the most (by 22.7 g CO2/km). CO2 emissions by car manufacturer Background EEA activities In accordance with current EU regulations ((EC) No 443/2009 for passenger cars and (EU) No 510/2011 for vans), the EEA collects\u00a0data on all new vehicles registered in Europe\u00a0and makes it available online. The data collected includes information on various parameters, including CO2\u00a0emissions and vehicle mass. Data is reported by all Member States in order to evaluate the performance of the new vehicle fleet towards the respective CO2\u00a0emissions targets. Laboratory versus real world driving emissions For 2016, Member States reported new vehicles' CO2 emission levels, measured under standardised laboratory conditions, following the requirements of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test procedure. Due to growing acceptance that the NEDC test procedure was out-dated and did not necessarily represent real-world driving conditions and emissions, in June 2016 the European Commission proposed to adopt a more demanding World Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), a globally harmonised test procedure developed within the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). Following recent agreement within the EU, the new WLTP test is mandatory for all new vehicle types introduced from September 2017 and for all new vehicles from September 2018. Beyond 2020 The European Commission has recently proposed setting new CO2 emission standards for cars and vans for the period after 2020. The proposed framework builds on the current Regulations setting CO2\u00a0emission standards for cars and vans.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/car-and-van-manufacturers-meet"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0171", "date": "2017-12-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Renewables accounted for vast majority of new EU power capacity in 2016", "text": "The EEA report \u2018Renewable energy in Europe \u2014 2017 update\u2019 provides an overview of progress in renewable energy in Europe, based on official statistics until 2015 and preliminary estimates for 2016.[1]\u00a0The new report complements the Agency\u2019s recent \u2018Trends and Projections in Europe 2017 \u2013 Tracking progress towards Europe\u2019s climate and energy targets\u2019 assessment. EU on track towards 2020 renewables target but progress slowing down The updated report confirms that the EU and most Member States remain on track to reach their renewable energy targets, although progress across the EU is losing some pace. The EU\u2019s joint target is to reach 20 % share of renewable energy in final energy consumption by 2020. The share of renewables in the EU final energy use increased from 16.1\u00a0% in 2014 to 16.7\u00a0% in 2015, and to an expected 16.9\u00a0% in 2016, according to EEA estimates. The share of renewables grew despite a back-to-back increase in total energy consumption in 2015 and 2016. Over the period 2005\u20132014, the share of renewable energy sources in the EU\u2019s gross final energy consumption increased, on average, by 6.7 % annually. However, in 2015, this growth rate slightly decreased to 6.4 %, and in 2016 to 5.9 %, over the entire period. According to preliminary EEA data, renewable energy accounted for 86 % of new EU electricity-generating capacity in 2016. Worldwide, the figure was about 62 %. The EU currently stands as a global leader in renewable power capacity per capita, having outpaced the rest of the world in the past decade in transforming its energy system, the report states. Progress in rolling out renewables in the EU since 2005 has lowered the gross inland consumption of fossil fuels by 10 % and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 9 %, compared to a scenario without growth in renewable energy use since 2005. The rapid development of technology and consequent cost reductions have already led to some renewable energy technologies achieving high market shares in Europe. According to the report, coal was the fuel that was most substituted by renewables across Europe, accounting for roughly half of all avoided fossil fuels and GHG emissions. Natural gas was the second most substituted fuel, accounting for about 30\u00a0% of the total. Switching to renewables has also improved the efficiency in power transformation, thereby reducing the EU\u2019s primary energy consumption by 2 %, the report notes. Use of renewables varies by country and market sector The EEA report shows that the share of renewables in final energy consumption varies widely within the EU. It ranges from more than 30\u00a0% in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Latvia and Sweden to less than 9\u00a0% in Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Heating and cooling remains the dominant market sector for renewables in Europe in both absolute and relative terms, followed by electricity generation. In the EU transport sector, renewable energy only made up about 7 % of all energy use in 2015 and 2016. The bulk of renewable energy use in transport comes from biofuels. The share of renewable energy jobs per capita in the EU was the fourth highest in the world in 2016, after Brazil, Japan and the United States. The largest employers in the EU renewables sector are the wind, solar and solid biomass industries. The EEA report notes, however, that jobs have been lost in the solar and wind power industry, due to growing competition from other producers, including in China, over the past five years.

It assesses the progress made under the ongoing EU-wide hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) phase-down and provides an outlook towards the global HFC phase-down, which is due to begin in 2019 under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. The report also details the amount of F-gases supplied to industry. The report assesses both the physical amounts (in tonnes) and in amounts weighted by the global warming potential of hydrofluorocarbon gas, which is measured in CO2-equivalent tonnes (CO2e). Hydrofluorocarbons are synthetic chemicals mainly used in refrigerators, heat pumps and air conditioners in buildings and cars. They were in many cases introduced to replace other chemicals that were found to be harming the ozone layer. However, these F-gases have also been found to be harmful to the environment and to contribute to climate change. Curbing F-gas emissions is an important part of the EU\u2019s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Phase-down of HFCs under the EU F-Gas Regulation The phase-down of F-gases is implemented through a system of annual quotas allocated to producers and importers. In 2016, EU-wide placing on the market of HFCs was 4 % below the 2016 market limit. By comparison, in 2015, companies remained 8 % under the limit. EU Contribution to the global phase-down of HFCs under the Kigali Amendment In 2016, HFC consumption in the EU was the lowest since reporting started in 2007 and was already 14 % below the first limit for the EU under the Montreal Protocol\u2019s Kigali Amendment. The Montreal Protocol to reduce the production and consumption of ozone depleting substances, was amended to regulate HFCs, in October 2016. Key Figures: Production of F-gases reported in tonnes went up by 2 % in 2016 compared to 2015. While the production of F-gases in the EU has increased (in tonnage) since 2014, the gases produced are relatively less harmful for the climate.

The interactive profiles summarise the latest data available (from 2015) related to industry, and cover air and water emissions, waste generation (in this case from 2014), energy and water use. The country profiles complement the EEA briefing 'Releases of pollutants to the environment from Europe's industrial sector,' published in July. Industry remains a major emitter of pollution Industry makes a significant contribution to Europe's economic wellbeing and is responsible for more than a fifth of economic value generated across the EEA-33. European Union policies\u00a0\u2014\u00a0specifically the EU's Industrial Policy Strategy\u00a0\u2014\u00a0aim for a low-carbon industrial sector: one that is based on circular material flows that draw less and less on natural resources, reduces pollutant emissions to air, water and land, and generates decreasing amounts of waste over time. Based on the best available data from countries, the EEA's industrial pollution country profiles help track progress towards these overarching aims. This set of industry country profiles show that the sector remains a significant source of pollution. While greenhouse gas and other pollution emissions have steadily decreased since 2007, the sector still emitted more than half of all carbon dioxide, non-methane volatile organic compounds, particulate matter (PM10), sulphur oxides and the heavy metals cadmium, lead and mercury into the air in 2015. The energy industry, specifically large combustion plants, was responsible for a large share of releases of these pollutants. In Malta, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Poland and Ireland, for example, energy providers emitted more than 90 % of sulphur oxide emissions in 2015. Other key findings: Industry is responsible for a quarter of the energy consumption in the EEA-33, including up to half in Iceland and more than 40 % in Slovakia and Finland. Industrial emissions of the above mentioned pollutants and greenhouse gases to air have decreased since 2007 in the EEA-33. Noteworthy exceptions include increased cadmium emissions in Greece and Portugal. Releases associated with large power plants are overall down in all EEA-33, among them sulphur oxide releases (down by 70 %), particulate matter (PM10; down by 69 %) and nitrogen oxides (down by 46 %). Industrial emissions of key pollutants to water such as nitrogen, phosphorous, total organic compounds (TOC) and important heavy metals have also been reduced but some of them to a lesser degree. Industry is responsible for more than half of the non-hazardous waste generated in EEA-33 and more than two thirds of the hazardous waste. Overall, all industrial sub-sectors except energy, cement production and the waste industry itself reported a reduction of the amount of waste generated since 2004 in EEA-33.

Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The EEA 'Environmental Indicator Report 2017'\u00a0gives an overview of the EU's progress towards 29 environmental policy objectives. These are relevant to the achievement of the 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP) three key priority objectives: natural capital; resource-efficient, low-carbon economy; and people's health and well-being. The annual report draws every year on the same 29 indicators\u00a0\u2014 updated with latest data \u2014 to provide an outlook on meeting each of the 29 objectives by 2020.\u00a0According to the report, many indicators show positive past trends but meeting relevant targets by 2020 remains a challenge. 'Following the 2008 financial crisis, lower economic activity in the EU contributed to several of the positive environmental trends shown in the report's indicators.\u00a0As economic growth is returning, increased efforts are likely to be necessary to maintain progress,' said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director.\u00a0'Looking beyond 2020, EU Member States need to accelerate progress in transforming key systems of production and consumption, including in food, energy and mobility, that have the greatest environmental and climate impacts'. This year's report changed the prospects of meeting two selected objectives compared with last year's assessment. The EU outlook of meeting by 2020 the ammonia reduction commitment was revised from 'likely' to 'uncertain'. Ammonia emissions come mainly from agriculture. Also, the 2020 prospects of keeping the average annual rate of land take below 800 km2 from 2000-2020 were revised from 'uncertain' to 'unlikely' to be achieved. Based on recent trends, the report also stresses that additional efforts are necessary in order to stay on track to meet the energy efficiency target while the EU is at an increasing risk to miss its objective of reducing the overall environmental impact from the mobility sector. The updated results of this year's report confirmed the overall results of last year's assessment by key 7th EAP priority objectives: Protect nature and strengthen ecological resilience:\u00a0The EU's natural capital is not yet being protected, maintained and enhanced in line with the ambitions of the 7th EAP. The 2020 outlook remains bleak overall for the selected set of objectives related to this priority objective. Boost sustainable, resource- efficient, low carbon growth:\u00a0The EU remains on track towards meeting its key climate and energy targets by 2020. Moreover, Europe's economy is growing faster than its use of raw materials, indicating better resource efficiency. However, efforts so far to reduce the environmental impact of production and consumption in key sectors of food, housing and mobility vary considerably in their success rates. Effectively address environment-related threats to health and well-being:\u00a0There have been substantial reductions in emissions of air and water pollutants in recent decades. However, key concerns persist around air quality and noise pollution in urban areas and chronic exposure of the population to complex mixtures of chemicals in products.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/critical-gaps-remain-in-europes"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0177", "date": "2017-11-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU still on track to meet targets on renewables and energy efficiency but progress slowing down", "text": "The EEA's new assessment consists of an annual analysis on the EU's progress towards its targets on renewables and energy efficiency. In this context, the EEA assessment provides input to the European Commission's third report on the State of the Energy Union, also released today. The EEA analysis is supported by updated climate and energy country profiles, which provide detailed information per Member State. \u201cThanks to earlier efforts, the EU is on track to reach its 2020 targets. Our assessment shows that this is not yet the case for the 2030 objectives. Given the time lag between planning and results, now is the time to start working towards 2030,\u201d said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. \u201cIn 2018, Member States need to come up with robust and ambitious national energy and climate plans, to channel investments and innovation towards an efficient, decarbonised EU energy system, and to address the lack of progress in the transport sector.\u201d The new EEA analysis and the country profiles complete the annual 'Trends and Projections in Europe: Tracking progress towards Europe's climate and energy targets' report package. The first part of the package, published earlier this month, showed that greenhouse gas emissions in the EU decreased by 0.7 % in 2016, to 23 % below 1990 levels, keeping the EU firmly on track to meet the 20 % reduction target by 2020. Growth in renewables The share of renewables in the EU energy mix continues to grow, reaching an estimated 16.9 % share of the EU's gross final energy consumption in 2016, according to preliminary EEA data. The EU's overall pace of deploying renewables since 2005 would be sufficient for achieving the target of 20 % share of renewable energy consumption by 2020, and for increasing this share to at least 27 % by 2030. However, the growth in renewable energy in 2015 and 2016 was slower than in previous years. Based on the latest official data from 2015, 25 out of 28 EU Member States \u2014 all except France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands \u2014 were on track to reach their individual targets on renewable energy by 2020. However, the trajectories for meeting the national targets get steeper towards 2020 and market barriers persist in several Member States. In the transport sector, there has not been sufficient progress towards the 10 % target for renewables by 2020, the report notes. According to preliminary estimates, the share of renewables in EU transport was 7.1 % in 2016. Progress on energy efficiency In 2015, 23 Member States were on track to meet their individual 2020 targets on primary energy consumption, a measure for energy efficiency. The EEA's preliminary data show that primary energy consumption in the EU increased in 2016 for the second consecutive year, by about 1.2 % compared with 2015. This back-to-back increase followed a large drop in 2014, due to an exceptionally warm winter that resulted in low energy demand for heating. The EEA analysis shows that the EU made quick progress on energy efficiency from 2005 to 2014. However, the recent increase in energy consumption, and the fact that the 28 national targets don't add up to the overall EU 2020 target mean that Member States must step up their current efforts to meet the collective EU objectives of 20 % energy savings by 2020, and 27 % by 2030. The European Commission proposed a new legislation package last year to reach the EU's climate and energy objectives for 2030. The package is currently under negotiation between Member States and at the European Parliament, and is expected to be adopted in 2018. About the report The 2017 edition of the annual European Environment Agency report, 'Trends and projections in Europe \u2013 tracking progress towards Europe's climate and energy targets', provides an updated assessment of the progress of the European Union and European countries towards their climate mitigation and energy targets. The report is based mainly on national data on greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy and energy consumption for 2015, preliminary ('approximated' or 'proxy') data for 2016, and projections reported by EU Member States concerning expected trends in emissions until 2035.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/eu-still-on-track-to"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0178", "date": "2017-11-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Restoring floodplains and wetlands offer value-for-money solution to river flooding", "text": "The EEA report \u2018Green infrastructure and flood management \u2014 promoting cost-efficient flood risk reduction via green infrastructure solutions,\u2019 outlines the challenges and opportunities posed by using more environmentally friendly options to bolster defences against river flooding. The report looks specifically at six case studies on the Elbe (Germany), the Rh\u00f4ne (France), the Scheldt (Belgium) and the Vistula (Poland) river basins, and points to the potential, in terms of suitable space, for restoring floodplains alongside them. Risk of flooding to increase River floods and flash floods remain one of the most frequent natural hazards in Europe. Around 20% of European cities are vulnerable to river floods. Increased urbanisation and soil sealing, along with wetland conversion or degradation, have contributed to increased run-off and flood risk and the frequency and intensity of floods are projected to increase over the coming decades due to climate change. This poses an increased risk to the economy, built-up infrastructure and human health. For centuries, efforts have been made to control flooding across Europe. Rivers have been dammed and constrained by levees, and dikes have been built to protect vulnerable land. Such measures have transformed the natural landscape and altered water flows throughout Europe. Wetlands have been converted to agricultural and urban land use and rivers disconnected from their natural floodplains. While the use of these man-made structures can significantly help reduce the risk of flooding, they often come at a sizeable financial price and at a cost to local water absorption capacity, wildlife, fish and river ecosystems. Their construction has also raised the risk of floods further downstream due to higher or cumulating water peaks and higher water speed. The case for nature-based solutions Limited budgets, updated European regulations and policies on water, agriculture, climate adaptation, and climate change itself are driving the push for more sustainable and lower investment solutions to address the challenges posed by flooding. Using green infrastructure like floodplains and wetlands are cheaper investments. They need little to no maintenance and are much more environmentally friendly than cement dams or barriers, which can pose problems for local ecosystems. Such sites can provide benefits beyond flood protection, such as carbon sequestration, homes for wildlife, recreation opportunities and clean water. A good example of such measures is demonstrated by the Dutch national plan \u2018Room for rivers\u2019. The way ahead The report says that more needs to be done to improve knowledge, experience and capacity in adapting building regulations to include nature-based solutions for flood defences in many EU Member States. It also notes that much better coordination on flood management plans is required between upstream and downstream areas and between countries that share rivers to enhance decision-making and implementation of green infrastructure for flood risk management.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/restoring-floodplains-and-wetlands-offer"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0179", "date": "2017-11-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European Air Quality Index: current air quality information at your finger tips", "text": "The EEA and the European Commission's new online service, the European Air Quality Index, provides information on the current air quality situation based on measurements from more than 2 000 air quality monitoring stations across Europe. The Index consists of an interactive map that shows the local air quality situation at station level, based on five key pollutants that harm people's health and the environment: particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ground-level ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). Users can zoom in or search for any town or region in Europe to check the overall air quality and measurements per key pollutant. The Index shows an overall rating for each monitoring station, marked by a coloured dot on the map, corresponding to the worst rating for any of the five pollutants. \"The new European Air Quality Index gives citizens an easy way to access information on their local air quality, which can have a direct impact on their health. This information, accessible to everyone, is an important basis for a dialogue and decisions that are needed to safeguard people's health, especially in cities,\" said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, presenting the Index today at the Clean Air Forum, organised by the European Commission, in Paris. Karmenu Vella, EU Commissioner for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries,\u00a0also welcomed the Index, saying: \"Air pollution is an invisible killer, so the Air Quality Index is needed to inform European citizens on the state of the air they breathe in their own neighbourhood. We are working with cities, regions, countries and industry to tackle the sources of that pollution, which is a cocktail coming from factories, homes and fields, not only from transport. We must all work together to improve air quality.\" The EEA has also published updated country fact sheets that provide an annual summary of air pollution and its impacts in EEA member countries. Providing more detailed, country-level information on both air pollutant emissions and air quality, the fact sheets complement the EEA's annual Air Quality in Europe \u2013 2017 report, published in October. The EEA's latest annual air quality report shows that most people living in Europe's cities are still exposed to levels of air pollution deemed harmful by the World Health Organization. The most harmful pollutant, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), caused the premature death of an estimated 400 000 Europeans in 2014. According to the report, air pollution has also significant economic impacts, increasing medical costs, reducing employees' productivity, and damaging soil, crops, forests, lakes and rivers. Road transport, agriculture, power plants, industry and households are the biggest emitters of air pollutants in Europe.

Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director This year's 'Trends and Projections in Europe' package includes an assessment of progress towards the EU's climate targets, preliminary EU greenhouse gas emissions for the year 2016, and a specific analysis of trends and projections in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). The final part of the package, assessing progress on energy targets will be published later this month. The reports are drafted yearly by the EEA to take stock of the EU's and Member States' progress in meeting their climate and energy targets, which includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % compared to 1990 levels by 2020. \"The EU is firmly on track to meet its 2020 emissions targets. This evolution illustrates the positive effects of innovation and investments in the low carbon economy of the future. However, it is clear we all need to considerably intensify our efforts if we are to meet our Paris agreement commitments and the more ambitious longer term goals for 2030 and 2050 in creating a low-carbon economy\", said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. Progress on 2020 climate targets According to preliminary estimates, emissions for 2016 in the EU decreased by 0.7% from 2015. The slight drop corresponds to a 23% decrease in emissions between 1990 and 2016. The decrease in 2016 was mainly due to a rising share of renewable energy and a switch from coal to gas in the EU's fuel mix for power generation, despite an increase in energy consumption and growth in emissions in the residential and transport sectors. These factors are reflected in the changes in emissions under the EU ETS and under the Effort Sharing Decision. In the EU ETS, which covers large industrial facilities and intra-EU flights, emissions declined by 2.6\u00a0% between 2015 and 2016. This reduction was mostly driven by emission cuts in large power plants, which reflects factors including the phasing out of coal use in several Member States. Emissions from airline operators, which account for 3\u00a0% of the total emissions covered by the EU ETS, increased compared with the previous year (up 7.6\u00a0%), as the number of passengers continued to grow. Altogether, emissions from industrial installations under the EU ETS stand now 26\u00a0% below 2005 levels. In the other sectors (such as transport, buildings, agriculture and waste), for which Member States have annual emissions targets at national level under the Effort Sharing Decision, preliminary estimates indicate that emissions aggregated at EU level increased by 0.9 % in 2016. A higher demand for heating (because of weather conditions) and a higher transport demand in 2016 help explain the increase. Emissions from these sectors are now 11% below 2005 levels. Most Member States meeting their targets Latest projections from Member States show that, while emissions from the EU as a whole will remain below the 2020 target, the situation differs between Member States. Twenty-one EU Member States expect to keep or reduce their emissions below their national targets by 2020. However, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and Malta need to enhance their efforts immediately to meet their 2020 targets. EU progress on 2030, longer term climate objectives Updated projections also show that current efforts need to be stepped up to achieve more ambitious longer term objectives. As already stated in previous assessments, the pace of reductions in emissions beyond 2020 is expected to slow down under current policies, falling short of the 40% reduction target for 2030. Discussions are ongoing in the EU to adopt a new package of legislation on climate and energy to achieve this goal, together with those set out under the Energy Union. Similarly, efforts to meet longer-term 2050 objectives on decarbonisation will also require a considerable intensification of efforts, and include a major transformation of Europe's energy, food and mobility sectors.

Mitigation is crucial as is ensuring effective action before, during and after a disaster.\" Hans Bruyninckx, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency. The EEA report 'Climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction in Europe \u2014 enhancing coherence of the knowledge base, policies and practices' not only assesses current practices and level of know-how, but also highlights emerging innovative tools national, regional and local authorities are using to tackle the impacts of weather- and climate-related hazards. \"The extent of devastation in the wake of forest fires, floods, storm surges not only in Europe and elsewhere has shown that the costs of not acting on climate change, as well as adaptation and prevention are extremely high. Mitigation is crucial as is ensuring effective action before, during and after a disaster. Our report shows that European countries have started preparing, but there is still much to gain from better coherence to improve resilience and reducing the risks. This should be the main goal for experts working in the adaptation and disaster risk reduction fields,\" said Hans Bruyninckx, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency. Extreme weather becoming more frequent, costly Reducing the impacts of dangerous weather- and climate-related events and at the same time adapting to a changing climate have become top priorities for the European Union. The report presents 10 key natural hazards in Europe, including heatwaves, heavy precipitation, river floods, windstorms, landslides, droughts, forest fires, avalanches, hail and storm surges. These events have large impacts on human health, the economy and ecosystems and they can be made more damaging by other changes like increases in soil sealing, building in risk-prone areas, ageing population or ecosystem degradation. Climate projections show that most of these hazards will increase in frequency and severity in the next decades across Europe. The total reported economic losses caused by weather- and climate-related extremes in the 33 EEA member countries over the 1980\u20132016 period amounted to over EUR 450 billion. The largest share of the economic impacts was caused by floods (approximately 40 %), followed by storms (25 %), droughts (approximately 10 %) and heat waves (approximately 5 %). The insurance coverage of all these hazards is overall about 35 %. A large share of the total losses has been caused by a small number of events. Regarding impacts on human health, heat waves are the deadliest especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, due, for example, to worsening of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, aggravated by air pollution. Flooding, landslides and forest fires also cause fatalities, but less than heat waves. Innovation and collaboration is key to success The report showcases new models of governance between national and local levels and across sectors in Europe. These touch on spatial planning and risk prevention policies and technical measures such as raising dikes, insurance schemes and long-term financing as well as 'nature-based' solutions. If carried out properly, such projects can be highly efficient and cost-effective and have multiple benefits. Projects can include, for example, providing room for rivers to reduce flooding, agro-forestry projects to reduce soil erosion, and building parks and water elements that cool cities in the summer and hold run-off from heavy rainfall. Such efforts can also boost biodiversity and human well-being. Cooperation between actors is key to success, the report argues. In the Netherlands, for example, the national government, water boards, provinces and municipalities work closely together to climate proof water management in the Delta Programme. Insurers can also help to strengthen resilience, as shown by examples from Spain, France and the United Kingdom, by creating incentives for risk prevention and by helping to improve understanding of climate risks among citizens. Also city networks, working at global and EU level, are important as they foster capacity building for both disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation actions. More action needed To further strengthen resilience, national climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies could be better integrated. More countries could perform and update comprehensive national climate change vulnerability and risk assessments. Climate services that provide climate data and projections (like Copernicus), can be better aligned with knowledge for disaster risk prevention. Improved knowledge of the economic costs of natural hazards is also important. National web-based knowledge platforms and multi-stakeholder coordination platforms can also help improve communication and in sharing information. Monitoring, reporting and evaluation of policies and actions are increasing, but more can be done and learning can be enhanced across climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction policy areas. EU funding for actions is available but access to and use of such funding, such as for nature-based solutions, can be enhanced. \u00a0 Background The EU's climate change adaptation strategy aims to mainstream climate change into other EU policies including disaster risk prevention. The EU civil protection mechanism puts emphasis on the prevention of natural and technological hazards and also aims to mainstream disaster risk management into other EU policies. The data on economic, human health and ecosystem impacts of past disasters is fragmented and incomplete. Countries are increasingly setting up national databases on impacts of disasters, which will in future lead to more comparable and consistent data, and contribute to improving policies and actions.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/preparing-europe-for-climate-change"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0183", "date": "2017-10-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Shift to sustainable food system in Europe is possible, but faces challenges", "text": "The EEA report 'Food in a green light,' analyses the challenges Europe faces in shifting to a sustainable food system and looks at current opportunities for change. The European Union must transform its food system to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring sustainable food production systems by 2030 and the European Union's long term sustainability goal of 'living well, within the limits of the planet' by 2050. The report, released on World Food Day, is a first EEA assessment of what a greening of Europe's food system might involve. It looks at the current state of play of Europe's food system against the goals of food and nutrition security, ecosystem health, and social and economic well-being. The challenge of going green Europe's food system is a large and complex one. The food supply chain, including agriculture and fisheries production, processing and manufacturing, through to the food and drink industry, had a turnover of \u20ac3.9 trillion in 2013. All these activities within the EU have an impact on the environment but also beyond its borders due to imports of food and feed. The system is a major consumer of energy and water and a large emitter of greenhouse gases and air pollution. The amount of energy necessary to cultivate, process, pack and bring food to our tables accounted for 17 % of the EU's gross energy consumption in 2013, equivalent to about 26 % of the EU's final energy consumption that same year. The report argues that reducing the environmental impacts of the food system requires more efficient and sustainable use of natural resources, changes in production methods, food choices and diets, and reducing environmental risks by phasing out the use of harmful chemicals throughout the food chain. Current policies mainly target producers and consumers and focus on improving the resource efficiency of the food system and consumer awareness. This approach can improve the environmental performance of the food system, but it will not deliver the type of transformation that is needed to meet sustainability goals. What will be key is changing mind-sets from a focus on food security and economic performance. Thinking about the different parts of the system, who is involved and relevant policies together can help to identify more effective actions. While Europe does not have a common food policy, it does have many related policies. Meeting long-term sustainability goals also depends on decisions being made today and the report identifies how current EU policy processes, objectives and targets offer opportunities to change the food system and deliver better outcomes for producers, consumers and the environment. Other key challenges include: Ensuring nutritious food at affordable prices. Providing viable and just incomes for farmers, fishers and other workers involved in the food system. Ensuring safer food \u2013 by reducing the impacts on health from pollution related to food production. This includes the phasing out the use of harmful chemicals throughout the food chain. Promoting dietary shifts to consume lower quantities of meat, dairy products and eggs which would reduce environmental impacts as well as reduce health risks. Dealing with food waste at different stages along the food supply chain. Reducing Europe's overseas land-use footprint, ensuring imports of sustainable livestock and aquaculture feed. Dealing effectively with the impact of climate change on food production and food prices. Reducing the negative effects of urbanisation on land use, especially arable farmland. Effective implementation of current commitments in the areas of agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, environmental protection, and research and innovation.\u00a0 The report's findings were presented at the 'Harnessing Research and Innovation for FOOD 2030 Science Policy Dialogue,' in Brussels on 16 October (2017).", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/shift-to-sustainable-food-system"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0184", "date": "2017-10-11", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Improving air quality in European cities will bring major health benefits", "text": "As a society, we should not accept the cost of air pollution.

This year's report also puts special focus on agriculture, which is an important emitter of air pollutants and greenhouse gases. A wide range of actions, including technically and economically viable measures, are available to reduce emissions from agriculture but have yet to be adopted at the scale and intensity needed, the report notes. Key findings Particulate matter: 7\u00a0% of the EU-28 urban population was exposed to PM2.5 levels above the EU's annual limit value in 2015. Approximately 82\u00a0% were exposed to levels exceeding the stricter WHO guidelines. Exposure to PM2.5 caused the premature death of estimated 428 000 people in 41 European countries in 2014. Nitrogen dioxide: 9 % of the EU-28 urban population was exposed to NO2 levels above the EU's annual limit value and WHO guidelines in 2015. Exposure to NO2 caused the premature death of estimated 78 000 people in 41 European countries in 2014. Ground-level ozone: 30 % of the EU-28 urban population was exposed to O3 levels above the EU's target value in 2015. Approximately 95\u00a0% were exposed to levels exceeding the stricter WHO guidelines. Exposure to O3 caused the premature death of estimated 14 400 people in 41 European countries in 2014. Background information on health estimates The estimated health impacts in this report are those attributable to exposure to PM2.5, NO2 and O3 in Europe in 2014. These estimates are based on information on air pollution, demographic data and the relationship between exposure to pollutant concentrations and specified health outcomes. Premature deaths are defined as deaths that occur before a person reaches an expected age. This expected age is typically the age of standard life expectancy for a country and gender. Premature deaths are considered to be preventable if their cause can be eliminated.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/improving-air-quality-in-european"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0185", "date": "2017-09-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "NATURE@work competition: Vote for your favourite photos", "text": "More than 1,000 photographs from 37 European countries were sent to the EEA\u2019s NATURE@work photo competition.

Phasing out the ozone-depleting substances is key to protecting the ozone layer in the Earth's atmosphere. The ozone layer serves an important function in protecting life on Earth as it absorbs sun's ultraviolet radiation. This radiation is harmful for the environment and humans, causing for example skin cancer. Key findings in 2016 data, as compared to 2015 are as follows: EU imports of ozone-depleting substances decreased by 15 %. EU exports of ozone-depleting substances decreased by 17 %. EU production of ozone-depleting substances decreased by 1 %. EU destruction of ozone-depleting substances decreased by 26 %. EU overall consumption (= production + import \u2013 export \u2013 destruction) of ozone-depleting substances decreased by 13 %. The EEA report is published in advance of the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, which is marked every year on 16 September. Background In 1989, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer entered into force. Its objective is to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out the production of ozone-depleting substances. The protocol covers over 200 individual substances with a high ozone-depleting potential, including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon tetrachloride (CTC), 1,1,1-Trichloroethane (TCA), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs), bromochloromethane (BCM) and methyl bromide (MB), all of which are referred to as 'controlled substances'. The Montreal Protocol was amended to regulate hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in October 2016, in Kigali, Rwanda. Both developed and developing countries have taken on mandatory commitments to reduce production and consumption of HFCs in the next three decades. Within the EU, ozone-depleting substances are covered by Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 (known as the ODS Regulation).

The dominant trend is the continued and accelerating shift from rural to urban use, influenced mostly by economic activities and urban lifestyle demands \u2014\u00a0such as high mobility and consumption patterns. The increased covering up of fertile land with buildings, transport infrastructure and industry offers economic benefits but also highlights the need to maintain Europe's natural and landscape resources. Pro-active and integrated policies on land planning, agriculture, recreation, tourism, transport, energy and other sectors can limit the negative effects of land take. In cities, smart and sustainable solutions for urban development \u2014 such as recycling old industrial lands into new uses and creating more green spaces \u2014 will be needed, the report says. The report also highlights that good land management can lead to a wide diversity of land use between rural and urban settings. It can also protect fertile lands for food and biomass production by ensuring effective means to promote soil functions, such as carbon storage and prevent soil erosion. As such, managing the land resource well is essential for a wider societal transition to sustainability, the report argues. People's surrounding physical landscapes can be useful for monitoring changes in society and the environment. However, there are still significant gaps in the knowledge and policy responses to manage land in Europe in an environmentally and societally sound way. One key element to fill these gaps is Copernicus, the European satellite system for monitoring the Earth, which will increase the precision and relevance of land-monitoring data. Main trends Expansion of urban areas (roads, rail, industrial parks, housing, commercial zones) continues to consume land with productive soil and to fragment existing landscape structures. Of all land cover categories, artificial areas increased the most in terms of both net area and percentage change. This is a constant trend that has been observed since 1990, although the increase of urban expansion in the 2006-2012 period was smaller than in the 2000-2006 period. Europe's agricultural land continues to decrease at an average rate of 1,000 km\u00b2 per year (according to latest data from 2006-2012). The structure and associated biodiversity of traditional rural landscapes in Europe continues to be affected by land take, agricultural intensification and farmland abandonment. The area of European forests has increased since the 1960s. Today, Europe is one of the most forest-rich regions in the world, with more than 42\u00a0% of its land covered by forests. However, forest land cover flows indicate an intensification of forest land use.

Greece did not report any data for 2015. Ammonia emissions increased most in France, Germany and Spain. Four Parties to the Convention (Germany, Spain, Sweden and the EU) exceeded their NH3 ceilings in 2015. Figure ES.5 Distance to Gothenburg ceilings for EU Member States Source: EEA, 2017 Notes: Estonia and Malta have not signed the Gothenburg Protocol and therefore do not have ceilings. Austria, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Poland have a ceiling, but they have not yet ratified the protocol. For Spain, data for emission comparisons exclude emissions from the Canary Islands. The comparison with emission ceilings is based on reporting on the basis of fuel sold, except for Belgium, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. These countries may choose to use the national emissions total calculated on the basis of fuelused in the geographic area of the Party as a basis for ceilings comparisons instead (UNECE, 2014a). For the EU-15, the comparison is based on fuel sold, except the data from the United Kingdom, as this Member State did not provide data based on fuel used. Under the Gothenburg Protocol, the EMEP Steering Body accepted inventory adjustment applications for emissions from Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Spain in 2014, 2015 and 2016. This figure takes these adjusted data into account.The EU-15 did not apply for adjustments and thus data for the EU-15 are unadjusted. \u00a0 The other main pollutants covered by the LRTAP Convention have dropped considerably since 1990, including the three air pollutants primarily responsible for the formation of ground-level ozone (O3). Carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) were reduced by 68%, 61 % and 56 % respectively. Around 94 % of ammonia emissions in Europe stem from agriculture, mainly from activities such as manure storage, slurry spreading and the use of inorganic nitrogen fertilisers. Ammonia contributes to eutrophication \u2014 an oversupply of nitrogen \u2014 and acidification of ecosystems. It also forms particulate matter in the atmosphere which has adverse effects on human health. Other key findings Across the EU-28, sulphur oxides (SOx) emissions have fallen the most with an 89% reduction since 1990. This is a result of a combination of measures including a switch away from fuels with high sulphur content to low-sulphur fuels such as natural gas, flue-gas desulphurisation in industrial facilities and EU directives relating to the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels. Emissions of primary particulate matter PM10 and PM2.5 have fallen by 24 % and 26 %, respectively since 2000, and black carbon (BC) by 40 %. The EEA member countries Norway and Switzerland, are also parties to the LRTAP Convention . In 2015, Norway exceeded the NH3 ceiling. Switzerland complied with all its ceilings. Emissions of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg), dioxins and furans, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have also dropped substantially since 1990, by about 67\u00a0% or more. Background The Gothenburg Protocol to the LRTAP Convention aims to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution. It sets emission 'ceilings' or limits for a range of air pollutants that have to be met from 2010 onwards. In addition to ceilings specified for individual countries, the protocol also specifies ceilings for the EU-15, i.e. for the Member States that were members of the EU when it was signed in 1999. The protocol was amended in 2012 with new emission reduction commitments for 2020 and beyond. The EU-28 \u00a0is in the process of ratifying the amended protocol. The EEA assists the EU by preparing the emissions inventory to be reported under the LRTAP Convention each year.

The analysis is based on the latest available data for 2015 recently added to the EU\u2019s European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR). The register contains data reported annually covering 35 000 industrial facilities over 65 economic activities located across the EU, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Serbia. Although good progress is being made by the EU towards its climate and energy policy objectives for 2020 and 2030, the briefing highlights that coal-fired power plants remain responsible for the largest releases of carbon dioxide (CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) to the environment. In 2015, Be\u0142chat\u00f3w (Poland) released the highest amounts for these three pollutants while Drax (United Kingdom), J\u00e4nschwalde (Germany) and Kozienice (Poland) were listed as top polluting facilities for each of these three pollutants. Of the 65 economic activities included in the E-PRTR, coal-fired power plants were responsible for Europe\u2019s largest releases of SO2 and NOx and comprised all but one of the facilities releasing the most CO2. Coal remains the most used fuel in large combustion plants \u2014 power plants, refineries or large chemical plants and steelworks \u2014 despite a decreasing amount being used over recent years. Still, these facilities have significantly improved their environmental performance over past years, releasing fewer emissions to air per energy unit consumed. Biomass use in combustion plants remains minor, but has increased threefold between 2004 and 2015. According to the analysis, half of the facilities responsible for the largest releases of air and water pollution were located in the United Kingdom (14 facilities), Germany (7), France (5), and Poland (5). Latest reported data also found that wastewater treatment plants were responsible for the highest amounts of total nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon released to water.

The briefing is based on a new study prepared for the EEA, \u2018Assessing the state-of-play of climate finance tracking in Europe\u2019 which found that only a few European countries have turned their climate and energy objectives into concrete investment needs and plans to date. Only Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, and to some extent, Germany, appear to have a national approach or strategy in place to track spending related to climate mitigation and adaption. The background study is a first Europe-wide stocktaking to capture the current status of climate finance tracking across the EEA\u2019s 33 member countries. The main focus was to identify data and knowledge gaps involved in tracking domestic climate finance. The study identifies a lack of country-level preparedness and information regarding estimated total investment needs, as well as their current and planned expenditure volumes for climate and energy purposes. As a result, European Union estimates of total climate finance investment needs are not matched by complementary national assessments.

The objective of the assessment is to provide an updated analysis and evaluation of the economic aspects of supply and demand effects on water management in Europe. The assessment is based on case studies involving eight EU Member States: Cyprus, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Romania, Spain and Sweden. The counties were selected on the basis of geographical coverage, reflecting the diversity of water demand management issues and approaches, as well as water stress levels and the availability of good data. The case studies found that European Union water policies encourage Member States to implement better management practices. Notably, water pricing policies (levies or tariffs on water use, for example) in combination with other measures, like encouraging the use of water saving devices on shower heads or taps, or education and awareness campaigns. A mix of the two has been used across Europe with varied results. The assessment concludes that national and local water management strategies should focus on designing the most effective combination to get the best results in reducing household water consumption and improving efficient use. The demand for water continues to increase, especially for domestic consumption. Increased intensity and frequency of droughts and water scarcity were identified as the key challenges for five of the eight countries (Cyprus, France, Italy, Romania, and Spain).

The briefing also provides an assessment of the projected emissions reported for 2020 and 2030 in relation to the Member States\u2019 reduction commitments for those years set in the new NEC Directive. The new NEC Directive restricts emissions for five key air pollutants: nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulphur dioxide (SO2) ammonia (NH3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). These pollutants contribute to poor air quality, which remains the single largest environmental health risk in Europe, causing respiratory and heart problems and shortening lifespans. They also can harm vegetation and sensitive ecosystems. Key findings On the basis of unadjusted emission totals, the following 11 Member States reported exceedances of their NEC Directive national ceilings for one or more pollutants in 2015: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Spain and Sweden. Emission ceilings for nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and ammonia (NH3) were exceeded by different combinations of six Member States for each pollutant. Projected emissions reported by 23 Member States show that 18 do not consider themselves on track towards meeting their reduction commitments set for 2020 for NOx, NH3, NMVOCs, SO2 and/or PM2.5 on the basis of the policies and measures they currently have in place. Similarly, 22 Member States are not on track to meet one or more of their 2030 commitments. For the EU as a whole, however, emissions for three pollutants (NMVOCs, SO2, and fine particulate matter PM2.5) are already below the EU\u2019s own 2020 emission reduction commitment set for these pollutants. Only for NOx a further, more significant, reduction is required in order to meet the 2020 reduction commitment. More substantial reductions are still needed for all pollutants if the EU is to achieve its 2030 emission reduction commitments. Further details, including country- and pollutant-specific information, are available in the briefing.

The EEA report stresses that improving the ability to reuse and refurbish goods can offer significant environmental and economic benefits by encouraging, for example, innovations in the design of less environmentally harmful products and product-based services. Key trends Although the linear economy may be deeply entrenched, emerging production and consumption trends indicate that the role of products in society is changing, with potential benefits for circular material use. For example, new technologies, such as 3D printing, can reduce the number of materials used in a product and can be used to print spare parts, stimulating the repair of products. However, such developments can also be a barrier for recycling if the technology leads to complex mixtures of different materials being integrated into one product. The report shows that the overall picture for the examined trends is rather unclear. Much will depend on governance and financial incentives to turn the most promising niche activities into mainstream economic models. The report also stresses that for such governance to be effective, better knowledge is needed about the links between products, their underlying business model and consumer behaviour.

The EU\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions increased in 2015 for the first time since 2010. Higher emissions were caused mainly by increasing road transport, both passenger and freight, and slightly colder winter conditions in Europe, compared to 2014, leading to higher demand for heating. Gains in the fuel efficiency of new vehicles and aircrafts were not enough to offset the additional emissions caused by a higher demand in both passenger and goods transport. Road transport emissions \u2014 about 20\u00a0% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 increased for the second year in a row in 2015, by 1.6\u00a0%. Emissions from aviation, representing about 4 % of the EU total emissions, increased by 3.3\u00a0% in 2015. In 2015, the EU greenhouse gas emissions increased only slightly, despite the strongest annual economic growth (+\u00a02.2\u00a0%) in the EU since 2007 and following a 4\u00a0% decrease in emissions in 2014. From 1990 to 2015, the EU reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 22.1\u00a0%, already surpassing its 2020 target of reducing emissions by 20%. During the same period, the EU economy grew about 50\u00a0%, which shows that long-term economic growth is possible while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The main reasons behind the emission reductions since 1990 include the effects of EU and national policies (leading to the growing use of renewable energy, use of less carbon intensive fuels and improvements in energy efficiency), structural change towards a more service-oriented economy, the effects of economic recession, and milder winters, leading to reduced energy demand for heating. Other findings for the year 2015 The reduction in total EU greenhouse gas emissions compared with 1990 was 23.7\u00a0% if emissions from international aviation are excluded. Greenhouse gas emissions under the EU emissions trading system (ETS) decreased by 0.7\u00a0%, excluding aviation, whereas emissions from the non-trading sectors increased by 1.4\u00a0%. Spain, Italy and the Netherlands accounted for the largest increases in greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. The United Kingdom showed the largest decrease of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. Total energy consumption and energy-related emissions increased, due to increased use of natural gas and crude oil. However, the reduced use of solid fuels, for the third consecutive year, and the sustained increase in renewables \u2013 particularly biomass, wind and solar \u2013 offset otherwise higher emissions. Electricity production from hydro and nuclear declined. In spite of the increase in emissions, the carbon intensity of the EU energy system declined due to higher shares of renewables and gas relative to coal in the overall fuel mix. EU greenhouse gas emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning decreased, ending an almost exponential increase of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions since 1990.

This helps Europeans make better informed choices about the bathing sites they plan to visit this summer. It also shows the effectiveness of our environmental policies and the practical benefits to human health protection and our daily lives when excellent data collection and analysis are conducted. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The report from the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Commission\u00a0confirms a positive 40-year trend of increasingly cleaner water at beaches and swimming spots across Europe. The assessment compiled analyses of water sampled at more than 21 000 coastal and inland bathing sites and gives a good indication where the best sites with the highest water quality are likely to be found this summer. Bathing water is sampled and monitored for contamination by faecal pollution from sewage or livestock. As in recent years, the vast majority of Europe\u2019s swimming spots can boast good quality water. In 2016, 96.3% of sites met the minimum \u2018sufficient\u2019 quality requirements set out in the EU\u2019s Bathing Water Directive. This is up slightly from 96.1% in 2015. More than 85% (85.5) of bathing water sites met the directive\u2019s most stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 water quality standards, up from 84.4% in 2015. Karmenu Vella, European Comissioner for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, said: 'The excellent quality of European Bathing Water sites is not by chance. It is the result of hard work by dedicated professionals. It shows the importance of nurturing EU policy that promotes green jobs. This year our European Green Week, 29 May \u2013 2 June, will celebrate this investment. Water technicians, flood protectors, environmental chemists, waste water managers \u2013 all play an essential role in keeping bathing water quality high'. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: 'It is encouraging to see that more and more bathing water sites across Europe are meeting the highest quality standards. This helps Europeans make better informed choices about the bathing sites they plan to visit this summer. It also shows the effectiveness of our environmental policies and the practical benefits to human health protection and our daily lives when excellent data collection and analysis are conducted.' The report covers bathing water locations across the EU, Albania and Switzerland. European bathing waters are much cleaner than forty years ago when large quantities of untreated or partially treated municipal and industrial waste water were discharged into water. Alongside the report, the EEA has also published an updated interactive map showing the performance of each bathing site. Updated country reports and information on the directive are available at the EEA and the European Commission bathing water websites. Other key findings: All reported bathing water sites in Austria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia, Malta, Romania, and Slovenia achieved at least \u2018sufficient\u2019 quality in 2016. In five countries, 95% or more bathing waters were assessed as being of \u2018excellent\u2019 quality: Luxembourg (all 11 reported bathing sites), Cyprus (99%of all sites), Malta (99% of all sites), Greece (97% of all sites), and Austria (95% of all sites). In 2016, 1.5% (1.4% for EU countries) of bathing water sites were rated as having \u2018poor\u2019 water quality. Between the 2015 and 2016 bathing seasons, the absolute number of bathing waters classified as \u2018poor\u2019 dropped from 383 to 318 (from 349 to 302 for EU countries). The highest number of bathing sites with \u2018poor\u2019 water quality were found in Italy (100 bathing water sites or 1.8%), France (82 sites or 2.4%) and Spain (39 sites or 1.8%) Background Faecal contamination of water continues to pose a risk to human health, especially if it is found at bathing water sites. Swimming at contaminated beaches or lakes can result in illness. The major sources of pollution are sewage and water draining from farms and farmland. Such pollution increases during heavy rains and floods due to sewage overflow and polluted drainage water being washed into rivers and seas. All EU Member States, plus Albania and Switzerland, monitor their bathing sites according to the provisions of the EU\u2019s revised Bathing Water Directive. The legislation specifies if the bathing water quality can be classified as \u2018excellent\u2019, \u2018good\u2019, \u2018sufficient\u2019 or \u2018poor\u2019, depending on the levels faecal bacteria detected. Where water is classified as \u2018poor\u2019, Member States should take certain measures, like banning bathing or posting a notice advising against it, providing information to the public, and suitable corrective measures. \u00a0 For more information on EU Green Week 2017 please go here www.eugreenweek.eu", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/more-european-sites-meet-excellent"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0199", "date": "2017-05-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Celebrating and protecting biodiversity", "text": "Today, 22 May, marks the International Day for Biological Diversity. Strong European policy on nature conservation is critical as constant habitat loss, pollution, over-exploitation of resources, and invasive alien species and climate change continue to have cumulative negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. According to the latest EEA assessment, the European Union (EU), so far, has shown limited progress in improving the conservation status of EU protected habitats and species, and the many pressures on these habitats and species remain. This lack of progress makes it difficult for the EU to meet its 2020 objectives set in its Biodiversity Strategy. As part of its contributions to the knowledge base for European environmental policy, European Environment Agency (EEA) hosts the European Biodiversity Data Centre and the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) providing information on protected areas, habitat types and species. One of its components, namely the EUNIS habitat classification, provides harmonised names and descriptions of European natural habitats. Harmonisation is important for countries\u2019 joint efforts on biodiversity monitoring and reporting. A new EEA briefing, published today, describes how the classification continues to be revised, with the current phase focusing on heathland, scrub and tundra habitats. Following a fitness check of the Birds and Habitats Directives and with the aim to boost their contribution towards reaching the EU's biodiversity targets for 2020, the European Commission has recently adopted an Action Plan for nature, people and the economy. The Action Plan focuses on four priority areas and comprises 15 actions to be carried out between now and 2019. EEA tools and products support many of these actions. In Europe, protected areas have a key role in safeguarding biodiversity. The Natura 2000 network of protected areas aims to ensure the conservation of targeted species and habitats of European Union interest. Currently, Natura 2000 covers over 18% of the EU land area and 6% of marine territory, making it the largest coordinated network of protected areas in the world. Last week, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the network, the European Commission proclaimed 21 May as European Natura 2000 Day. In other European countries, the Emerald Network is based on the same principles as Natura 2000, helping to develop a coherent approach to the protection of natural habitats and species on the European continent. To put more focus on the benefits people receive from nature, the EEA has launched a photo competition, \u2018NATURE@work\u2019, inviting European citizens to submit photographs until 15 August that illustrate how nature protects, inspires and provides for us.\u00a0The winners of the competition will be awarded a cash prize, and the submitted photos can be featured in EEA products.

The assessment identified four areas where the directive was implemented well. These include: the use of certain flexibilities to reduce administrative burden for smaller emitters; the completeness of sampling plans to better determine emissions; the use of more accurate methods by installations for measuring emissions; and the decreasing number of complaints against accredited companies in charge of verifying emissions reports. Areas for improvement Several areas were identified where improvements would enhance the application of the EU ETS Directive. These include in particular: better reporting by operators on possible improvements to monitoring; more detailed verification procedures; better reporting of biofuel use and better implementation of monitoring and reporting requirements by aircraft operators; better notification of authorities by operators on changes to their installations; better coordination between different authorities within countries; or improved reporting by countries on penalties for non-compliance.

This reduction brings the EU average emissions 6.4% below the 2017 target of 175 g CO2/km. This target was already met in\u00a02013. Further efficiency improvements are still needed to reach the EU\u2019s more stringent target of 147 g CO2/km set for 2020. Key findings:\u00a0 In 2016, almost 1.6 million new vans were registered in the EU, an increase of 9 % compared to the previous year. More new vans were sold in most Member States. However, three Member States reported lower sales: Latvia (-25%), Czech Republic (-19%) and France (-8.2%). Two out of three new vans (66%) registered in the EU were sold in just four Member States: the United Kingdom (22%), France (18%), Germany (15%) and Italy (11%). The average fuel-efficiency of new vans varied widely across Member States due to the different models and sizes of vehicles sold in each country. Average emissions were lowest in Portugal (140.5 g CO2/km), Bulgaria (141.5 g CO2/km) and Cyprus (143.7 g CO2/km) and highest in Slovakia (185.6 g CO2/km), the Czech Republic (183.8 g CO2/km) and Germany (178.8 g CO2/km). The average weight of new vans sold in 2016 also varied across countries. Smaller vehicles (lighter than 1 620 kg)\u00a0were sold in Bulgaria, Malta and Portugal; larger vehicles (heavier than 1 940 kg) in Slovakia, Czech Republic and Austria. Only 10 177 electric and plug-in hybrid vans were sold in 2016, representing 0.6 % of the total EU van sales. This is significantly lower than the 157\u00a0096 electric and plug-in hybrid passenger cars sold the same year, a share of 1.1% of\u00a0total car sales. Diesel vehicles continue to make up the vast majority of the new van fleet, constituting 96% of sales.

It also provides an update on the measures being taken by EU Member States in addressing noise issues. Noise pollution remains a major environmental health problem in Europe, with the transport sector being a major cause.\u00a0 Road traffic noise is the dominant source affecting human exposure above the EU\u2019s threshold of 55 decibels (dB) for daily exposure and 50 dB for night exposure. Around 100 million people are exposed to road traffic noise above 55 dB in the 33 member countries of the EEA (Figure 1). Of these, 32 million are exposed to very high noise levels (above 65 dB). Railways is the second largest source, with 19 million people exposed above 55 dB. Aircraft noise, close to major airports, is the third main source, with more than 4.1 million people exposed, followed by industrial noise within urban areas, with 1.0 million people exposed. Noise from road traffic alone is the second most harmful environmental stressor in Europe, behind air pollution, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The harmful effects of noise arise mainly from the stress reaction it causes in the human body, which can also occur during sleep. These can potentially lead to premature death, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance, hypertension and, at the least, annoyance. Figure 1.

This represents a decrease of 1.4 g CO2/km (1.2%), compared to the previous year, according to provisional data. This reduction is the smallest annual improvement recorded since 2006 for new cars sold in the EU. Official emissions have, however, decreased by more than 22 g CO2/km or 16% since 2010, when an updated monitoring system started under the current EU legislation. The EU remains well below its target of 130 g CO2/km set for 2015, but it is clear that, compared to 2016, annual improvements in vehicle efficiency need to significantly increase in each of the coming five years in order to achieve the second average emissions target of 95\u00a0g CO2/km by 2021. Key facts\u00a0 With an average of 118.1 g\u00a0CO2/km, new cars sold in 2016 emitted more than 23 g CO2/km above the 2021 target, according to the provisional emissions reported by Member States. A total of 14.7 million new passenger cars were registered, an increase of almost 7% compared to 2015. Registrations increased in all EU Member States except in the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Slovenia. For the second successive year, the share of diesel vehicle sales declined and in 2016 fell below 50% of new sales \u2014 the lowest share of new sales since 2009 according to the official statistics. While the overall share of diesel vehicle sales fell, absolute sales still increased by more than 192 300 vehicles compared to 2016, according to provisional data. However, diesel cars still remain the most sold vehicle type in the EU representing 49.4% of new sales, followed by petrol vehicles (47%), and alternatively fuelled vehicles (3.3%, including electric vehicles). Sales of battery electric vehicles continue to increase, but at a significantly slower rate than in earlier years. Around 64 000 pure battery-electric vehicles were registered in 2016, a 13% increase compared to sales of 57 000 in 2015. The largest number of registrations were recorded in France (22 689 vehicles), Germany (11 472 vehicles) and the UK (10 268 vehicles). Electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles together still remain a small fraction of total sales, accounting for 1.1% of all new cars sold in the EU. Combined sales of these vehicle types fell by around 3 200 vehicles compared to 2015 when they comprised 1.2% of registrations. The two countries that in 2015 had the highest share of plug-in hybrid and battery-electric vehicle sales, the Netherlands and Denmark, both saw significant sales decreases in 2016 of these vehicle types. For example, in the Netherlands, sales fell from 10% of national car sales in 2015 to 6%. Changes to the level of subsidies and tax incentives available for new vehicle owners changed in 2016 in both countries, directly contributing to lower shares. The mass of a vehicle is a key factor affecting emissions, as heavier vehicles tend to emit more CO2/km. In comparison with 2015, the average mass of new cars sold in 2016 in the EU increased slightly to reach 1 388 kg. The increase affected the average mass of petrol vehicles (by 1.5%) in particular, which in turn resulted in smaller decrease of average emissions of these vehicles and, consequently, of new passenger car fleet in 2016. On average, the heaviest cars were sold in Sweden (1 516 kg), Austria and Luxembourg (1 497 kg), whereas Maltese, Greek and Danish buyers typically purchased lighter cars (1 210, 1 253 and 1 265 kg respectively). Nevertheless, the average diesel vehicle sold was 302 kg heavier than the average petrol vehicle. Overall, average CO2/km emissions decreased in all countries in 2016, except in the Netherlands, where emissions increased by almost 5% to 106 g CO2/km. However, the Netherlands, together with Portugal (105 g CO2/km), Denmark and Greece (both 106 g CO2/km) remains among the countries having the most fuel-efficient new cars sold. The least fuel-efficient cars continue to be bought in Estonia (134 g CO2/km). The largest improvements in vehicle fuel efficiencies, compared to the previous year, occurred in Latvia (-8.2 g CO2/km) and in the Czech Republic (-5.2 g CO2/km). In both countries, a trend towards buying lighter, smaller vehicles was directly reflected in the improved average vehicle fuel efficiencies. EEA activities The EEA collects and makes available data on new passenger vehicles registered in Europe, in accordance with EU Regulation (EC) No 443/2009. The data reported by all Member States is designed to allow an evaluation of the average fuel efficiency of the new vehicle fleet, and includes information on a range of parameters including registration statistics, CO2 emissions, and vehicle weight. It has not yet been confirmed whether different manufacturers have met their own specific annual target for 2016, based on the average weight of the cars they sold.

Growth in renewables continues to bolster climate change mitigation in the EU. The EU-wide share of renewable energy use increased from 15% in 2013 to 16% in 2014. This upward trend continued also in 2015, as renewable energy accounted for the majority (77%) of new electricity-generating capacity for the eighth year in a row. Recent data from Eurostat showed that the EU-wide renewable energy use finally reached 16.7% in 2015 \u2013 which is close to the EEA\u2019s 16.4% preliminary estimate published in December 2016. This steady EU-wide progress in renewables since 2005 enables the EU to stay well on course to reach its target of 20\u00a0% by 2020. At Member State level, the shares of renewable energy use continues to vary widely, ranging from over 30% in Finland, Latvia and Sweden, to 5% or less in Luxembourg and Malta. Increased reliance on renewables reduces the need for fossil fuels, lowering associated emissions The uptake of renewable energy since 2005 allowed the EU to cut its fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by about a tenth in 2015 \u2013 comparable to the annual fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions of Italy. Three quarters of these greenhouse gas reductions attributable to renewables came from the development of renewable electricity production. Coal was the most substituted fuel across Europe, representing about one half of all avoided fossil fuels, followed by natural gas (28% of all avoided fossil fuels). In both 2014 and 2015, the largest reductions in fossil fuel use and CO2 emissions due to the uptake of renewable energy sources took place in Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. Renewables catching on worldwide Global investments in renewables continued to show steady growth over the past decade. This has led to a doubling of global renewable electricity capacity between 2005 and 2015. The EU plays a leading role in developing clean energy technology and is ranked second after China in installed and grid-connected domestic renewable electricity capacity. Still, some non-EU countries are seeing faster progress, something observed also in terms of the share of renewable-energy related jobs in the labour force where in 2015 the EU was overtaken by other countries, such as Japan and China. The EU and its Member States will need to step-up their climate and energy efforts if they want to meet EU ambitions to become a sustainable, low-carbon economy by 2050, the report says.

These efforts are supported by LIFE, the EU\u2019s financial instrument for environmental, nature conservation and climate action projects. The EU is also active in finding nature-based solutions to support economic growth, create jobs and enhance our well-being. The \u2018NATURE@work\u2019 photo competition is open to all European citizens over the age of 18 and invites them to submit photographs that illustrate any of the following three themes: NATUREprovides: Can you capture in a photo the benefits nature makes available that you cherish most? NATUREprotects: Have you noticed how the nature around you \u2013 in the countryside, your town or city, protects you? NATUREinspires: Can you spot anything around you that was inspired by nature? The winners in each category above will be awarded a cash prize. All entries may be promoted by the EEA and its partners across Europe. You can submit your photos until 15 August.

The report includes case studies that analyse how 11 cities across Europe are developing, funding and implementing urban adaptation measures. The case studies outline various projects that will help cities better protect themselves from the damage caused by extreme weather events. These include building more green spaces and installing green roofs, which enhance water retention and provide cooling as well as thermal insulation. The publication is meant to serve as a resource for adaptation financing providers and project developers from international, national or regional public bodies and private institutions. The report also includes a helpful annex providing an overview of European-level financing options available to municipalities. Innovative funding options The costs needed to adapt cities to the effects of climate change vary but can run into millions of euros. The lack of funding has been cited by mayors, city managers and planners as one of the main reasons for the slow uptake of adaptation. Public funds for adaptation measures can be difficult to find in wake of other budgetary priorities. At the same time, many European cities and towns are facing significant investment needs to replace old infrastructure for basic services (such as sewer systems), buildings and transport over the next decade. Integrating climate adaptation requirements into such investments would save money in the long term, the report argues. Municipalities across Europe have found different ways to finance adaptation. These range from tapping into public funds to more innovative financing mechanisms, including crowdfunding and green bonds. Green infrastructure measures with multiple benefits, such as nature conservation, recreation and quality of life, are receiving increased attention. Demonstrating multiple benefits of such measures can increase the chance of securing funds. Cities are also organising themselves to share best practices and promote environmental cooperation through the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy and other similar organisations. The European Union has earmarked at least 20 percent of all its expenditures during the 2014-2020 budget period for climate change action \u2013 for mitigation and adaptation. Further national and regional financial streams are also available. However, the funds available through the EU and national and regional authorities meet only a small part of the investment needed. Public investment can act as \u2018seed money\u2019 unlocking additional major private investment of a different type and scale.

The scale of future climate change and its impacts will depend on the effectiveness of implementing our global agreements to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but also ensuring that we have the right adaptation strategies and policies in place to reduce the risks from current and projected climate extremes.\u2019 Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The observed changes in climate are already having wide-ranging impacts on ecosystems, the economy and on human health and well-being in Europe, according to the report \u2018Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe 2016\u2019. New records continue to be set on global and European temperatures, sea levels and reduced sea ice in the Arctic. Precipitation patterns are changing, generally making wet regions in Europe wetter and dry regions drier. Glacier volume and snow cover are decreasing. At the same time, climate-related extremes such as heat waves, heavy precipitation and droughts, are increasing in frequency and intensity in many regions. Improved climate projections provide further evidence that climate-related extremes will increase in many European regions. \u2018Climate change will continue for many decades to come. The scale of future climate change and its impacts will depend on the effectiveness of implementing our global agreements to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but also ensuring that we have the right adaptation strategies and policies in place to reduce the risks from current and projected climate extremes,\u2019 said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. Climate change hotspots All European regions are vulnerable to climate change, but some regions will experience more negative impacts than others. Southern and south-eastern Europe is projected to be a climate change hotspot, as it is expected to face the highest number of adverse impacts. This region is already experiencing large increases in heat extremes and decreases in precipitation and river flows, which have heightened the risk of more severe droughts, lower crop yields, biodiversity loss and forest fires. More frequent heat waves and changes in the distribution of climate-sensitive infectious diseases are expected to increase risks to human health and well-being. Coastal areas and floodplains in western parts of Europe are also seen as hotspots as they face an increased risk of flooding from rising sea levels and a possible increase in storm surges. Climate change is also leading to major changes in marine ecosystems as a result of ocean acidification, warming and the expansion of oxygen-depleted dead zones. Ecosystems and human activities in the Arctic will also be strongly affected owing to the particularly rapid increase in air and sea temperatures and the associated melting of land and sea ice. Although some regions may also experience some positive impacts, such as improving conditions for agriculture in parts of northern Europe, most regions and sectors will be negatively affected. Map ES.1 Key observed and projected climate change and impacts for the main biogeographical regions in Europe Source: EEA, 2017 Ecosystems, human health and economy Ecosystems and protected areas across Europe are under pressure from climate change and other stressors, such as land use change. The report highlights that the impacts of climate change are a threat to biodiversity at land and in the seas. Many animal and plant species are experiencing changes to their life cycles and are migrating northwards and to higher altitudes, while various invasive species have established themselves or have expanded their range. Marine species, including commercially important fish stocks, are also migrating northwards. These changes affect various ecosystem services and economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry and fisheries. The main health effects of climate change are linked to extreme weather events, changes in the distribution of climate-sensitive diseases, and changes in environmental and social conditions. River and coastal flooding has affected millions of people in Europe in the last decade. The health effects include injuries, infections, exposure to chemical hazards and mental health consequences. Heatwaves have become more frequent and intense, leading to tens of thousands of premature deaths in Europe. This trend is projected to increase and to intensify, unless appropriate adaptation measures are taken. The spread of tick species, the Asian tiger mosquito and other disease carriers increases the risk of Lyme disease, tick-borne encephalitis, West Nile fever, dengue, chikungunya and leishmaniasis. The economic costs of climate change can be very high. Climate-related extreme events in EEA member countries account for more than EUR 400 billion of economic losses since 1980. Available estimates of the future costs of climate change in Europe consider only some sectors and show considerable uncertainty. Still, the projected damage costs from climate change are highest in the Mediterranean region. Europe is also affected by climate change impacts occurring outside Europe through trade effects, infrastructure, geopolitical and security risks, and migration. Enhancing adaptation and knowledge Mainstreaming of climate change adaptation into other policies is progressing but can be further enhanced. Other possible further actions include improving policy coherence across different policy areas and governance levels (EU, transnational, national and subnational), more flexible adaptive management approaches, and the combination of technological solutions, ecosystem-based approaches and \u2018soft\u2019 measures. The development and use of climate and adaptation services are increasing in Europe. Improved knowledge would be useful in various areas, for example, on vulnerability and risk assessments at various scales and on monitoring, reporting and evaluation of adaptation actions, their costs and benefits, and synergies and trade-offs with other policies. Background The report is an indicator-based assessment of past and projected climate change and its impacts on ecosystems and society. It also looks at society\u2019s vulnerability to these impacts and at the development of adaptation policies and the underlying knowledge base. The report was developed by the EEA in collaboration with the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the World Health Organisation Regional Office for Europe and three European Topic Centres (ETC-CCA, ETC-BD, ETC-ICM). This is the fourth \u2018Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe\u2019 report, which is published every four years.

The new findings largely confirm preliminary data published for cars and vans earlier this year. They show that new cars sold in the EU in 2015 had CO2 average emissions of 119.5\u00a0g CO2/km, which was 8.0\u00a0% below the 2015 target of 130 g CO2/km, and 27\u00a0% lower than in 2004.\u00a0 Similarly, the average emissions from vans sold in 2015 were 168.3\u00a0g CO2/km, below the 2017 target of 175\u00a0g CO2/km. This represents a reduction of 6.5\u00a0% since monitoring commenced in 2012. In order to meet their respective future targets, i.e. 147\u00a0g CO2/km for vans by 2020 and 95\u00a0g CO2/km for cars by 2021, the average CO2 emissions need to continue decreasing at a similar pace. The report also presents data on manufacturer\u2019s individual performances. The majority of car and van makers met their CO2 specific emissions target in 2015. Two manufacturers, Aston Martin Lagonda and Ferrari, exceeded their specific emissions target by a small amount and therefore excess emission premiums will be imposed. Other key findings As in previous years, conventional diesel and petrol cars accounted for the large majority of new sales in 2015 (97.2\u00a0%). Diesel vehicles remained the most sold vehicles in Europe, constituting 52 % of sales, slightly lower than in 2014 when 53 % of all new cars were fuelled by diesel. The proportion of plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles increased from 0.8\u00a0% in 2014 to more than 1 % in 2015. For vans, the vast majority of vehicles are fuelled with diesel (97 %). Diesel cars, which on average are 300\u00a0kg heavier than petrol cars, emitted on average 119.2\u00a0g CO2/km. This is 3.3\u00a0g CO2/km less than the average for petrol cars. The emission difference between diesel and petrol cars has been narrowing in the last decade. In 2000 the difference was 17.1\u00a0g CO2/km. Amongst the largest car manufacturers, Automobiles Peugeot, Automobiles Citroen, Renault and Toyota Motor Europe continue to produce most of the lowest-emitting cars. Improving their performance by more than 5\u00a0g CO2/km, Automobiles Peugeot (104\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km) and Automobiles Citroen (106\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km) had the lowest average CO2 emissions for new passenger cars registered in 2015. Toyota Motor Europe had the highest percentage of new vehicles having emissions below 95 g\u00a0CO2/km (41 %). The largest reductions in average emission levels in the last year were achieved by Jaguar Land Rover Limited (14.4\u00a0g CO2/km) and Daimler AG (6.9\u00a0g CO2/km). For the third year in a row, Automobile Dacia SA achieved the lowest average CO2 emissions from vans (133 g CO2/km). Automobiles Peugeot, Automobiles Citroen and Renault also produce low emitting vans (less than 151 g CO2/km). \u00a0 Latest data sets CO2 emissions from cars and vans: Data for cars Data for vans \u00a0 CO2 emissions by car manufacturer Background EEA activities In accordance with current EU regulations ((EC) No 443/2009 for passenger cars and (EU) No 510/2011 for vans), the EEA collects\u00a0data on all new vehicles registered in Europe\u00a0and makes it available online. The data collected includes information on various parameters, including CO2\u00a0emissions and vehicle mass. Data is reported by all Member States in order to evaluate the performance of the new vehicle fleet towards the respective CO2\u00a0emissions targets. The EEA report documents the latest official data submitted by Member States and vehicle manufacturers. However, it is not possible to assess the extent to which incorrect data from vehicle manufacturers may alter the analysis and conclusions. The final CO2 performance for each manufacturer and pool is confirmed by Commission Decision. \u00a0 Laboratory versus real world driving emissions Member States report new vehicles\u2019 CO2 emission levels, measured under standardised laboratory conditions, following the requirements of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test procedure. This cycle allows a comparison of emissions by manufacturers, but it does not necessarily represent real-world driving conditions. There is now wide recognition of the increasing divergence between real world CO2 emissions and those measured according to the NEDC test procedure.\u00a0 In order to address this increasing gap, the European Commission has proposed in June 2016 the implementation of a more robust test procedure, the World Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). This new test procedure will ensure more strict and representative test conditions. It is foreseen that the new WLTP test will be mandatory for all new vehicle types from September 2017 and for all new vehicles from September 2018. \u00a0Additional information The European Commission press release:\u00a0CO2 emissions from new cars and vans continue to fall", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/co2-emissions-from-cars-and"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0209", "date": "2016-12-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European hazardous waste management improving, but its prevention needs attention", "text": "The EEA report \u2018Prevention of hazardous waste in Europe \u2013 the status in 2015,\u2019 \u00a0is the third annual review of waste prevention programmes done by the EEA. This year\u2019s review focuses on the prevention of hazardous waste that is one of the priorities of environmental policies in Europe. The assessment looks at current trends in the amounts of hazardous waste generated both in Europe and in individual countries, based on the latest data available. It provides an overview of waste prevention objectives, targets, indicators, and measures. At a reported 100 million tonnes, hazardous waste accounted for close to 4% of the 2.5 billion tonnes of waste generated across the European Union in 2012. The predominant types of hazardous waste were mineral and solidified wastes, chemical and medical wastes, with the waste management, construction, mining and quarrying, and household sectors as the top sources. Total hazardous waste generation has increased slightly since 2008, according to the report. More than half of the reviewed waste prevention programmes include measures to reduce the generation of hazardous waste. Most of the measures are linked to curbing production and including bans on toxic materials. However, prevention of hazardous waste appears to have lower priority than management aspects, and limited financial support. Prioritisation at the EU level is one of the drivers for better prevention at national or regional levels, the report says. The report also raises data quality issues, and highlights that changes in waste classification and definition of hazardous waste cause reporting and interpretation problems and may affect the accuracy and comparability of national data.

The report also looks at the big changes underway in the sector, from emerging technologies such as electric and driverless cars, to recent innovations that are becoming increasingly popular, such as shared or on-demand mobility services for commuters. It is clear that Europe\u2019s environment will continue to face transport-related pressures, such as air pollution, biodiversity fragmentation, traffic congestion, inefficient use of urban space and noise. Transport activity across Europe is expected to continue growing under current trends and policies. From 2010 to 2050, it is estimated that passenger transport will grow by about 40\u00a0%, with aviation as the fastest growing sector. Freight transport is expected to grow by 58\u00a0%. Consistent with these outlooks, greenhouse gas emissions under current policies are forecast to increase slightly between 2030 and 2050 to 15\u00a0% above 1990 levels, significantly higher than the 60\u00a0% reduction target proposed for 2050. Reaching Europe\u2019s long term environmental targets will therefore still require substantial efforts. So what changes can society make to our mobility system to significantly improve its sustainability? The report stresses that while technological developments will continue to largely determine the future environmental performance of the transport sector, many past beneficial technological advances have historically been offset by the ever increasing demand for transport. Meeting decarbonisation and other environmental goals for the sector requires not only incremental changes such as improvements to the fuel efficiency of road vehicles, planes and ships, but also more far reaching changes, such as the widespread introduction of electric vehicles and changes to lifestyles and habits which greatly influence the way that society uses transport. Looking to the future, the report identifies the scale of change required, in terms of transport\u2019s environmental performance, in order to meet the EU\u2019s long-term decarbonisation targets for 2050. It also looks at the strong links and interdependencies between the transport system and the food, land use and tourism sectors. Various barriers and \u2018lock-ins\u2019 that can hold up or delay the shift to a more sustainable mobility system are presented. One clear example of a \u2018lock-in\u2019 is society\u2019s continued dependence on the fossil-fuel powered internal combustion engine, coupled with continued investments in traditional road transport infrastructure, which can hamper efforts to shift to more sustainable modes of transport. Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism (TERM) The annual TERM reports published by EEA use the latest available European data in order to assess key trends, measures and overall progress of the transport sector towards its environmental policy targets. Each year, the reports also address a specific issue. Recent TERM reports have for example evaluated the environmental impacts associated with urban and long-distance transport, the impact of transport on air quality, and the effect of transport policies on the past evolution of the sector and its pressures on the environment. \u00a0 Related content TERM transport indicator fact sheets", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/term-2016-fundamental-changes-needed"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0211", "date": "2016-12-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Fluorinated gases continue to be phased down in Europe", "text": "F-gases were in many cases introduced to replace chemicals that were found to be harming the ozone layer. Currently, F-gases are mainly used in refrigerators, heat pumps and air-conditioning equipment in buildings and in cars. The EEA report \u2018Fluorinated greenhouse gases 2015\u2019 tracks progress towards the EU target of reducing F-gas emissions by two thirds by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. According to the report, the production, imports, exports and supply of F-gases in the EU decreased in 2015, both in physical amounts as well as in amounts weighted by the global warming potential of the gas in question, measured in CO2-equivalent tonnes (CO2-eq.). The F-gas share of the global warming potential of the EU\u2019s overall greenhouse gas emissions was 3\u00a0% in 2014, but this share has been on the increase. Curbing F-gas emissions is therefore an important part of the EU\u2019s overall commitment to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 40 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Large reductions in F-gas use and emissions are expected from a new phase-down measure, which will progressively cap the sales of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) on the EU market down to 21\u00a0% of baseline levels by 2030. Furthermore, bans on the use of F-gases that have a high global warming potential are expected to result in additional reductions. The Montreal Protocol to reduce the production and consumption of ozone depleting substances was amended to regulate HFCs, in October 2016, in Kigali, Rwanda. Both developed and developing countries have taken on mandatory commitments to reduce production and consumption of HFCs in the next three decades. Key findings of \u2018Fluorinated greenhouse gases 2015\u2019, based on reporting by companies in the EU: Production of F-gases in the EU declined by 5\u00a0% (as CO2-eq.) in 2015. F-gas imports to the EU decreased by about 40\u00a0%, compared with the exceptionally high amounts reported in 2014 (both by weight and as CO2-eq.). EU exports of F-gases decreased by 2\u00a0% (by weight) or 1\u00a0% (CO2-eq.) compared with 2014. However, compared to 2013, exports in 2015 increased by 18\u00a0% (by weight) and 23\u00a0% (CO2-eq.).

On average, land recycling has increased in Europe but the levels remain low compared to land take, the report shows. Based on Copernicus satellite data, land recycling as a share of total land consumption across EEA member and cooperating countries (EEA-39) has increased from about 2.0-2.2 % in 1990-2000 to about 2.7-2.9 % in 2006-2012. However, the rates vary considerably across countries. Land is a finite resource with many demands, and land take and soil sealing have long been a cause for environmental concern. From 2006 to 2012, taking land for development in Europe (EEA-39) continued at an average annual rate of 1065 km2. However, land in urban areas is sealed and reused in small parcels and often remain undetectable by land take monitoring. Analysis of land recycling and soil sealing needs more detailed data. For example, measured by high resolution imperviousness data, during 2006-2009 soil sealing increased at an average annual rate of 1454 km2. When soil is covered with an impervious surface, such as tarmac, the functioning of the ecosystem is disrupted, impacting nutrient and water cycles as well as the soil\u2019s ability to supply ecosystem services, including everything from provision of food and water to climate regulation and space for recreation. By recycling land, the report showcases, it is possible to reduce new land take and also to improve the ecological status of previously developed land. Land recycling, hence, can be key to maintaining and developing green spaces that are important for ecosystem services. Recycling land can also make an important contribution to achieving a circular economy, in which maximum value is derived from limited resources, in this case land. The report also compares different models of land recycling based on a life-cycle assessment of the environmental impacts of developing and using a land area. The assessment shows that bringing previously developed land back to more efficient use or improving its ecological state have greater positive impacts than turning, for example, agricultural land into urban development.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/land-recycling-helps-europe"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0214", "date": "2016-12-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Innovations across Europe lead way towards sustainable future", "text": "The report \u2018Sustainability transitions: Now for the long term\u2019\u00a0is a first exploration of the role the EEA and Eionet can play in meeting the emerging data, information and knowledge to support sustainability transitions.

This analysis is included\u00a0in the report \u2018Trends and Projections in Europe 2016: Tracking progress towards Europe climate and energy targets\u2019.\u00a0The EEA report is supported by country profiles on energy and climate, providing detailed data at national level. \u2018Our report \u2018Trends and projections in Europe 2016\u2019 shows that the EU's 2020 targets on energy and climate are now well within reach. But certain trends are alarming, in particular for transport. In that sector, renewable energy use remains insufficient and greenhouse gas emissions are rising again,\u2019 said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. \u2018The way forward is clear: Member States must step up national ambition and efforts to achieve the 2020 and 2030 EU targets, and to keep the EU on a path to a low-carbon, competitive and circular economy by 2050.\u2019 On track for 2020 targets By 2020, 20\u00a0% of the EU\u2019s gross final energy consumption should come from renewable sources. Preliminary estimates for 2015 show that the share of renewables in the EU\u2019s final energy consumption continued to increase, reaching a level of 16.4\u00a0%. This is up from 16.0\u00a0% in 2014. Twenty two Member States (all except France, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal) are on track to achieve or exceed the levels of renewable energy set in their national action plans. The EU\u2019s 2020 target on energy efficiency corresponds to a 13\u00a0% reduction of primary energy consumption compared with the 2005 level. Preliminary estimates show that the EU\u2019s energy consumption in 2015 was 11\u00a0% below 2005, despite a 1\u00a0% increase between 2014 and 2015. The EU remains on track to achieve its 2020 energy efficiency target. Except for Estonia, Malta and Sweden, all EU Member States are on course to meet their targets on primary energy consumption. However, Member States show an overall lack of ambition with regard to their 2020 energy efficiency targets. More work needed for 2030 and 2050 goals To achieve the more ambitious longer-term energy and decarbonisation goals set by the EU for 2050, current efforts will have to be considerably stepped up, according to the EEA report. The EU can achieve its 2030 target on renewables if the current pace across Europe is maintained. However, this will require additional efforts because regulatory changes affect investors\u2019 confidence in renewables, while market barriers persist. Similarly, achieving the 2030 target on energy efficiency will require effective implementation of energy efficiency measures as well as a rapid change in consumer behaviour.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/renewables-continue-to-grow-in"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0216", "date": "2016-11-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Quality of Europe\u2019s water for people\u2019s use has improved, but challenges remain to keep it clean and healthy", "text": "The EEA report \u2018European water policies and human health,\u2019 provides a combined review of three key legislative acts that underpin water management in the EU \u2014 the Bathing Water Directive, the Drinking Water Directive and the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, which contribute to achieving the over-arching objectives set by the Water Framework Directive. EU water legislation makes a significant contribution towards ensuring public health and environmental protection across Europe. The EU legislation sets binding standards for Member States to ensure high water quality for drinking and for recreational purposes, and to limit pollution caused by waste water discharged to the environment. Member States must report key parameters of water quality and management measures under these rules. These include ensuring that all significant discharges of sewage from homes and industry undergo collection and treatment, defining water quality suitable for bathing waters and setting requirements for the quality of drinking water to protect human health. Better water management showing positive results The EU\u2019s water policies on bathing water, drinking water and urban waste water have been effectively applied across the 15 older EU Member States while Member States that joined after 2004 are making steady progress on reaching the objectives. Bathing water quality across the EU continues to be high. The percentage of bathing water sites meeting the minimum water quality standards (of at least sufficient quality) increased to 96.1 % in 2015. Testing and analyses between 2011-2013 show achievement rates of over 98.5% in meeting EU standards on clean drinking water. Wastewater treatment in all parts of Europe has improved during the last 15-20 years, with a growing proportion of the population connected to waste water treatment facilities and with the waste water being treated to more demanding standards. Achievement rates in the EU-15 are in general very high, while, though improving, in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe the proportion of population connected to wastewater treatment is still relatively low compared to Central and Northern Europe.

Nitrogen and phosphorus from waste water treatment plants and industry, and emissions from agriculture \u2014 fertilisers and manure \u2014 remain the main sources of nutrient and organic pollution. Importantly, the report also highlights the emergence of other pollutants, which are typically chemicals present in low concentrations but which may have harmful effects on aquatic organisms or those that feed on them. Micro-plastics, such as those found in personal care products, and micro-organisms resistant to antibiotics, present risks which need to be better understood. EU water legislation and, in particular, the Water Framework Directive, provides ways to address these challenges. The EEA report also stresses that better integration of EU legislation on water may help to deal with current and future challenges. Water quality and human health are top EU priorities Water is an essential resource and ensuring high quality and safe supply to all Europeans is an integral part of the EU\u2019s environmental policy. Since 1975, the EU has worked to adopt a wide range of legislation on water that aims to protect consumers and water users, including the environment, against harmful effects. In Europe, about 50\u00a0% of drinking water is taken from groundwater and about 40\u00a0% from surface water. Ten percent of drinking water is used from other sources, like artificial groundwater recharge or bank filtration water.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/quality-of-europes-water-for"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0217", "date": "2016-11-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Stronger measures needed to tackle harm from air pollution", "text": "Emission reductions have led to improvements in air quality in Europe, but not enough to avoid unacceptable damage to human health and the environment. We need to tackle the root causes of air pollution, which calls for a fundamental and innovative transformation of our mobility, energy and food systems. \u00a0 Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The EEA report \u2018Air quality in Europe \u2014 2016 report\u2019 presents an updated overview and analysis of air quality in Europe from 2000 to 2014 based on data from official monitoring stations across Europe, and including more than 400 cities. It shows that in 2014 around 85 % of the urban population in the EU were exposed to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at levels deemed harmful to health by the World Health Organization (WHO). Particulate matter can cause or aggravate cardiovascular diseases, asthma and lung cancer. The report also provides new estimates(1) of the health impacts of the most harmful air pollutants based on 2013 data. Exposure to PM2.5 was responsible for about 467\u00a0000 premature deaths in 41 European countries\u00a0in 2013. Within the European Union, premature deaths exceeded 430 000. The estimated impacts of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ground-level ozone (O3) exposure were around 71\u00a0000 and 17\u00a0000 premature deaths respectively in Europe. \u201cEmission reductions have led to improvements in air quality in Europe, but not enough to avoid unacceptable damage to human health and the environment,\u201d said EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx. \u201cWe need to tackle the root causes of air pollution, which calls for a fundamental and innovative transformation of our mobility, energy and food systems. This process of change requires action from us all, including public authorities, businesses, citizens and research community.\u201d Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, welcomed the report and added: \u201cToday's \u00a0EEA report on air quality reminds us that we need to keep this subject high on the political agenda. The European Commission is doing so, and is committed to securing improvements in air quality. One way we can do that is to help different levels of government work better together. If a lot of air quality blackspots are in towns and cities then it is clear that local and regional governments play a central role in finding solutions. This week I hope that the European Parliament will vote positively on our reduction commitments in the new National Emission Ceilings Directive. This will provide direction for national and local actors.\"\u00a0 The report highlights that air quality has however improved over the years. The annual average PM10 has fallen in 75\u00a0% of monitored locations during the period 2000\u20132014. Similarly, PM2.5 concentrations, on average, have decreased between 2006 and 2014 for all station types (urban, traffic, background sites, etc.). Exposure to PM levels above WHO recommendations have also decreased over the years.\u00a0 Other key findings In 2014, 16\u00a0% of the EU-28 urban population was exposed to PM10 levels above the EU daily limit value whereas 8\u00a0% was exposed to PM2.5 levels above the EU target value. However, when compared to the stricter WHO Air Quality Guideline values set to protect human health, approximately 50\u00a0% and 85\u00a0% of city dwellers were exposed to PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations exceeding the WHO\u2019s recommendations. NO2 affects the respiratory system directly, but also contributes to the formation of PM and O3. In 2014, 7 % of the urban population in the EU-28 were exposed to NO2 concentrations above the identical WHO and EU standards, with 94 % of all exceedances occurring due to traffic. PM2.5 emissions from coal and biomass combustion in households and from commercial and institutional buildings have not decreased to any significant degree. To lower emissions from these sectors, it is essential to fully implement measures, such as recent changes to the Eco-design Directive for household stoves, the Medium Combustion Plant Directive, and to provide public guidance on good household burning practices, etc. Emissions of ammonia (NH3) from agriculture remain high and contribute especially to sustained PM levels and a number of high-PM episodes in Europe. Air pollution continues to damage vegetation and ecosystems. In this context, the most harmful air pollutants are O3, NH3 and NOx.\u00a0 Revision of the National Emission Ceilings Directive Following the political agreement reached with the Council in June of this year, the European Parliament formally votes this week on the revised National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive. Member States are subsequently also expected to confirm their agreement of the revised directive before the end of 2016. The legislative proposal will establish new national emission reduction commitments applicable from 2020 and 2030 for SO2, NOx, NMVOC, NH3, and PM2.5 which will help Member States in their efforts to improve air quality.\u00a0 (1) A number of variables, including population density and exposure, total mortality figures\u00a0and demographic changes such as\u00a0ageing are taken into account when calculating these estimates. They can vary from year to year.

The rate of municipal waste going to landfills in the 32 EEA member countries fell from 49 % in 2004 to 34 % in 2014. Overall, the rates of landfilling decreased in 27 out of 32 countries. In Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, virtually no municipal waste was sent to landfill sites. Total municipal waste generation in the 32 EEA member countries declined by 3 %\u00a0 and average generation per person dropped by 7% from 2004-2014. However, the analysis found that there has not been a uniform trend across countries. There has been an increase in municipal waste generation per person in 16 countries and a decrease in 19 others. Recycling facts One of the success stories of European environmental policies is the increase in the rate of municipal waste recycling (which covers material recycling, composting and digestion of bio-wastes). EEA countries achieved an average total recycling rate of 33 % in 2014, compared with 23 % in 2004. (For EU Member States: 37 % to 44 % over the same 2004-2014 period). Germany, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden recycled at least half of their municipal waste, statistics show. Overall, in 15 out of 32 countries, the increase in recycling rates was at least 10 percentage points over the 2004-2014 period. Increased recycling rates and declining rates of landfilling are clearly linked, the analysis says. Usually, landfilling declines much faster than the growth in recycling, as waste management strategies mostly move from landfill towards a combination of recycling and incineration. In some cases these strategies also include pre-treatment such as mechanical-biological treatment, the outputs of which are then recycled, incinerated or landfilled. Future progress Despite progress in living up to European legislation on waste management, the outlook for reaching the EU\u2019s 50 % recycling target for municipal waste by 2020 is mixed and many countries will have to step up their efforts, according to the best data available. It is important to note however, that the data used in this assessment do not necessarily show progress against the target for all countries. Member States can choose between four different methods to monitor their progress, and the data uses the same method for all countries. In addition, data on waste and indicators is limited in some cases. Countries have different definitions of what constitutes municipal waste or the make-up of recycled material. For example, some countries include only waste from households, while others include similar wastes from commercial activities and offices. Improvements in waste data and further harmonisation of national reporting methods would help the effectiveness of policy measures. Municipal waste only accounts for around 10 % of total waste generated in the EU, but it remains a visible problem. Preventing it reduces the associated environmental pressures and recycling would help turn waste turns it into a valuable source of material for the economy. The European Commission last year proposed new targets for municipal waste \u2013 a target for recycling 65 % of municipal waste by 2030 and a target to reduce landfill to a maximum of 10 % of municipal waste by 2030. These proposals are part of the Commission\u2019s circular economy package which aim to maintain the value of products, materials and resources in the economy for as long as possible.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/less-household-waste-going-to"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0219", "date": "2016-11-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU firmly on course to reach 2020 target, despite a slight increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2015", "text": "Despite the small increase in emissions in 2015, the EU remains fully on track toward its 2020 climate targets Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The two EEA reports, \u2018Trends and Projections in Europe 2016: Tracking progress towards Europe climate and energy targets,\u2019 and \u2018Approximated EU greenhouse gas inventory: Proxy GHG emission estimates for 2015\u2019 provide updated assessments of the progress of the European Union and European countries towards their climate change mitigation targets. The Trends and Projections report will be developed further with an assessment of the progress made on energy targets, expected to be published soon. The EU\u2019s 2020 targets include reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20\u00a0% compared to 1990 levels. The EEA reports show that EU emissions in both 2014 and 2015 were reduced by more than 20 % compared to 1990 levels. Preliminary greenhouse emission estimates indicate a 0.7\u00a0% increase expected for 2015. This follows an exceptional 4.0\u00a0% reduction the previous year, which was due to a particularly warm winter. Emissions from industries in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) continued to decrease in 2015. On the other hand, emissions not included in the ETS increased. In particular, transport emissions increased for the second year in a row. \u00a0 \u201cThis year\u2019s report shows that despite the small increase in emissions in 2015, the EU remains fully on track toward its 2020 climate targets. This progress forms a strong basis for implementing the Paris Agreement, which has just come into force. Nevertheless, achieving the more ambitious longer-term goals for 2030 and 2050 will require more sweeping changes and a transition to a low-carbon economy\u201d, said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. Progress of Member States on 2020 climate objectives The latest national projections available from EU Member States indicate that by 2020, EU greenhouse gas emissions will remain well below the 2020 target. Progress of individual Member States toward their individual targets is more nuanced, however. These targets cover emissions from sectors which are not included in the EU ETS. In 2014, all Member States, except Malta, met their annual targets. Estimates indicate a similar situation occurred in 2015. A total of 23 Member States project that their greenhouse gas emissions will be below their national targets in 2020 with the current set of policies and measures in place. The five remaining Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg) will have to implement additional measures to reach their targets. Member States can also use flexibility mechanisms which allow them to transfer emission credits from one year to another or between Member States. EU progress towards 2030 climate targets While projections from EU Member States show further decreases in EU greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2020, the pace of these reductions will slow down. Updated projections show that planned reductions will only bring EU emissions between 26 % and 29 % below 1990 levels by 2030. This falls short of the EU\u2019s 40 % reduction target for 2030. However, the agreed reform of the EU Emissions Trading System and recent policy proposals being discussed in the EU have not yet been taken into account in projections. These proposals include new annual binding greenhouse gas emission targets for Member States from 2021-2030, integration of the land use and forestry sector into the 2030 policy framework, and a European strategy to cut emissions from the transport sector.

These can serve as useful examples of lessons learned on urban planning and design approaches for socially and environmentally-resilient cities. Case studies involving 17 cities from across Europe, including Aarhus, Bucharest, Leipzig, Madrid, Oslo and Vienna, were screened for the assessment. The report looks at the major challenges urban river and lakes have to deal with, including availability and supply of drinking water, water quality, flood protection and management, well-being and quality of life benefits, and stakeholder involvement in governance issues. Rivers and lakes have played a key role in the development of European cities and towns, but arguably urbanisation has come at a high cost. Most urban rivers were channelled into canals, buried or otherwise confined. Industrialisation has led to further degradation, with waterways becoming dumping grounds for sewage, pollutants and other wastewater, generating significant public health issues. Restricting or altering the flow of rivers has also increased flood risks. However, with improvements in wastewater treatment and reduced industrial activities over the past three decades, urban rivers and lakes have become increasingly important in meeting the demand for a better, more sustainable quality of life. Urban rivers and lakes have gained a more positive image, providing space for recreation and offering an aesthetically pleasing environment as part of city regeneration projects. Cleaner rivers and lakes are a win-win for cities and towns The report stresses that the restoration of rivers and lakes is a win-win situation, by improving flood control and ecological functions while offering recreational value and raising the quality of life in urban areas. Well-functioning and healthy waterways also mitigate the impacts of climate change in the city, such as increased temperatures already observed in city centres. The report calls for the proper implementation of European legislation, including the Water Framework Directive, Floods Directive and Habitats Directive to help deliver benefits. And it suggests that urban planning authorities also take into account more stringent adaptation measures to mitigate the effects of climate change and to step up cooperation between water and development planners as well as including the views of city residents. Success stories In recent decades, improvements in wastewater treatment and reduced industrial activities have improved water quality in most European cities, which in turn has been beneficial for river and lake ecology. Until 2011, Bucharest discharged wastewater from more than 2\u00a0million inhabitants without treatment into the D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba river, but a new wastewater treatment plant started operating five years ago and treats the entire wastewater flow of the Bucharest urban area, eliminating one of the major pollution hotspots in the Danube river basin. In many European capitals (Paris, London, Dublin, Stockholm and Oslo), the return of fish has signalled cleaner waters, and in some cities it is now possible again to bathe in the waters close to the city centre such as the Harbour baths in Copenhagen or swimming in the River Isar in Munich. Over the last century, many urban rivers were channelled into canals, buried or otherwise confined. This report describes how several cities and towns have dealt with the impacts of physical modifications such as giving room for the river or opening covered river stretches. The report also includes examples of multifaceted restoration projects focused on reducing flood risks and opening the city towards the rivers, creating new green recreational spaces.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/restoring-european-rivers-and-lakes"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0222", "date": "2016-10-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Fish to fork: a need to implement changes in the food system", "text": "The report \u2018Seafood in Europe; a food system approach for sustainability\u2019 takes an in-depth look at the increasingly complex evolution of the global food system and what this means for Europe. With a focus on seafood, the report explores the knowledge base on food systems and assesses the implications of such a food system analysis for EU policy and knowledge development. The EU has committed to align its practices to new global sustainability goals, as recently set out in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and as part of the EU's 2050 goal of living well within the limits of our planet. The food system \u2014 which in general terms includes all the materials, processes and infrastructures relating to production, trade, transport, retail, and consumption of food products and the outputs of these activities \u2014 will have to change to meet these goals. \u00a0\u00a0 Fish as food matters for the EU Global changes such as population growth, urbanisation and rising incomes explain the increase in global food demand. Part of this demand is to be met by fish, which will mostly come from aquaculture. Currently, most of the world\u00b4s fisheries are either fully fished (58 %) or overfished (31 %). In Europe's seas, overfishing remains high: 50 % of fish stocks in the north-east Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea, and over 90 % in the Mediterranean and Black Seas are fished above their maximum sustainable yield. Globally, as we reach the natural limits for the oceans to provide more fish to our food supply, the rapid expansion of aquaculture will be the main driver of growth in production. Already, in 2014, for the first time in history, more fish for human consumption have originated from farms than from wild capture. These trends matter for the EU's food and nutrition security since fish is already an important source of food. Europeans favour wild fish (75 % of consumed fish products come from fisheries) and the average fish consumption per capita in the EU is the second highest in the world (at around 22 kg/person/year). To meet this demand, the EU sources more than half (55%) of its seafood from abroad. It is the largest importer of seafood and fish products in the world, with a market share of 20 % of total global imports between 2013 and 2015. Boosting efforts to implement an ecosystem approach to Europe's seas \u2014 a key principle in several EU policies \u2014 is critical, the report adds. Measures such as respecting sustainable levels in fisheries or implementing networks of marine protected areas are essential for ensuring the long-term viability of fisheries and the availability of resources on which the whole food supply-chain depends. Mind the knowledge gap Current assessments tend to focus on the environmental impact of fisheries and aquaculture on Europe\u2019s marine ecosystems or the economic performance of the sectors, both of which are critical. However, significant information and knowledge gaps to understand key interactions on the journey of fish to fork exist. There is limited information available beyond market data that enables tracing the EU's need for seafood outside its borders. International trade and market dynamics mask vital signs from ecosystems, such as the state of local fish stocks. According to the EEA report, filling some of these knowledge gaps does not necessarily require big investments. There is already a wealth of existing data and information, such as those from the EU Common Fisheries Policy. These could be further explored to better link what is happening at sea to what and who is driving the production of seafood.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/fish-to-fork-a-need"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0223", "date": "2016-10-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Surplus emission permits start decreasing in the EU\u2019s emissions trading system", "text": "The report \u2018Trends and projections in the EU ETS in 2016 \u2013 The Emissions Trading System in numbers,\u2019 provides the latest assessment of past, present and future trends in the system in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and emission allowances. The analysis is based on the latest data available from the European Commission and Member States. The EU ETS is a cornerstone of the EU\u2019s efforts to combat climate change. Postponing the auctioning of 300 million allowances in 2015 contributed to reducing by 17\u00a0% the surplus of 2.1 billion emission allowances that had accumulated in the system since 2008. The surplus remains substantial, equivalent to one year\u2019s worth of CO2\u00a0emissions in the EU ETS.

Emissions continue to decline under the ETS\u2026 Greenhouse gas emissions covered by the EU ETS declined by 0.7\u00a0% in 2015 compared to 2014. Overall, EU ETS emissions decreased by 24\u00a0% between 2005 and 2015 and are now below the cap set for 2020. The decrease was mostly driven by changes in the type of fuels used for power generation (less hard coal and lignite fuels and a jump in renewables). Emissions from the other industrial activities covered by the EU ETS have also decreased since 2005, but remained stable in recent years. \u2026but reductions are expected to slow down According to projections available from EU Member States, emissions under the EU ETS will continue to decrease with the current policies and measures in place, although at a much slower pace than between 2005 and 2015. As many as 13 EU Member States project increases in their ETS emissions up to 2030 (Belgium, Croatia, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden). These projections do not all account for recent policy developments to address the current surplus (a market stability reserve) and the proposal for a steeper annual decline of the overall number of allowances from 2021 onwards, in order to put the ETS on track to achieve a 43\u00a0% cut in emissions by 2030 compared to 2005, as a contribution to the EU\u2019s 40\u00a0% reduction target for total EU emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/surplus-emission-permits-start-decreasing"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0224", "date": "2016-10-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Decommissioning fossil fuel power plants between now and 2030 essential for Europe\u2019s low carbon future", "text": "A clear, forward-looking investment strategy is also necessary across the fossil fuel power sector to meet our long-term challenge to cut CO 2 \u00a0emissions. Europe is committed to decarbonise its economy so we cannot afford to tie up our investments in emission-intensive technologies. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The EEA report \u2018Transforming the EU power sector: avoiding a carbon lock-in\u2019 stresses the need for Europe to become more forward-looking when it comes to investing in cleaner energy sources. It calls on the EU to seize the opportunity to 'decarbonise' the energy generating sector, replacing ageing and end-of-life coal-fired plants with renewable energy sources where possible between now and 2030. The report gives a detailed analysis of the energy generating sector, looking specifically at the technical lifetimes of existing fossil fuel capacity across Europe. It also draws a comparison showing that similar lifetimes in the future would be incompatible with the EU\u2019s climate goals and highlights that meeting these goals can only be realised if fossil fuel capacity decreases progressively within this decade. Europe's electricity generating sector is at the heart of the EU\u2019s decarbonisation strategy. Power generation remains the largest greenhouse gas-emitting sector, being responsible for roughly one third of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions and more than half of the verified emissions under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). As such, the sector has a big role to play in meeting commitments on reducing emissions and improving air quality. \"I welcome today's report 'Transforming the EU power sector: avoiding a carbon lock-in' and am grateful that EEA raised this discussion. It is indeed imperative that new investments that will be done in the next few years go rather towards clean energies such as renewable, and don't result in a carbon lock in from fossil fuels we can't have in our future energy system. The COP21 agreement, negotiated last year, has been ratified by enough countries to enter into force and give Europe a chance to set an example and become the global leader for energy efficiency,\" said Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, European Commission Vice-President in charge of Energy Union. \"Europe is now generating four times more wind power and 70 times more solar power as in 2005. This is good news, but a clear, forward-looking investment strategy is also necessary across the fossil fuel power sector to meet our long-term challenge to cut CO2 emissions. Europe is committed to decarbonise its economy so we cannot afford to tie up our investments in emission-intensive technologies. Investing in renewables and energy efficiency provides the best return on our money,\" said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. Avoiding a \u2018carbon lock-in\u2019 The report illustrates that past trends of extending the life of large fossil fuel power plants (at or above 200 MWe capacity) or building new ones would clash with the EU\u2019s best-case decarbonisation scenarios as set out in the EU\u2019s Energy Roadmap 2050, resulting in fossil fuel overcapacity. This hypothetical situation is based on a detailed, unit-by-unit analysis of fossil fuel power capacity in Europe and its potential evolution up to 2030 based on current circumstances and technical lifetime assumptions. At present, power plant operators tend to prolong the operation of inflexible, carbon-intensive plants. If this trend is sustained while new fossil fuel capacity is added to the system, all fossil fuel power plants would need to curtail their activity to meet the EU\u2019s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The report argues that a pan-European approach to climate and energy reduces the need for back-up fossil fuel generation capacity at national level. It also calls for an integrated and coherent tracking of progress towards EU climate and energy targets. This includes a regular sharing of information on the evolution of fossil fuel capacity and information on expected carbon-intensity levels over the short and medium term, to improve consistency in national and European decarbonisation efforts. It also suggests that an increased alignment of energy, climate and environmental policies can maximise benefits and speed up the transition to a secure, sustainable and competitive EU power sector.

However, larger numbers of electric vehicles will not be enough for the shift to a low-carbon economy. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The EEA briefing 'Electric vehicles and the energy sector \u2014 impacts on Europe's future emissions' looks at the impact of different scenarios that take into account the increased use of electric cars and their effect on the European Union's (EU) energy system, and on emissions of greenhouse gases and selected air pollutants. \"Electric vehicles powered by renewable energy sources can play a bridging role in the EU\u2019s plans to move towards a greener, more sustainable transport system, and in meeting its goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80\u201295% by 2050. However, larger numbers of electric vehicles will not be enough for the shift to a low-carbon economy. Other problems such as growing demand for transport and congestion remain and need to be addressed as well,\" said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. Several scenarios were explored, including one model where electric cars have an 80% share of the EU's total car fleet in 2050. Additional electricity generation will be required in the EU to meet the higher energy demand. The need for extra power will be higher if other sectors like industry or households do not follow through on planned energy efficiency improvements. The use of renewable energy in 2050 will also have an effect on the level of emissions from the power-generating sector. Overall, the resulting carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reductions in the road transport sector would outweigh the higher emissions caused by the continued use of fossil fuels in the power-generating sector. In the EU, a net reduction of 255 million tonnes of CO2 could be delivered in 2050. This amount is equivalent to around 10% of the total emissions estimated for that year. However in countries with a high share of fossil power plants, environmental benefits would be lower. This would also lower the benefits of using electric vehicles in these countries. An 80 % share of electric vehicles would also significantly reduce overall emissions of certain air pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). For other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide (SO2), emissions could increase due to the continued use of coal in the electricity generation sector. A larger number of electric cars on the road may pose future challenges for Europe\u2019s power production capacities and put stress on existing power grids. Under the 80% scenario, the share of Europe\u2019s total electricity consumption from electric vehicles would increase from around 0.03% in 2014, to 9.5% by 2050. A more extensive infrastructure providing more public charging points would be key as well as increased power capacity able to handle a larger European car fleet. The assessment stresses that closer coordination between the road transport and energy sectors on policy making and investments will be crucial. Pros and cons of electric vehicles Today's briefing is complemented by the publication of a new EEA guide on electric vehicles in Europe, which provides a non-technical summary of the latest information on electric cars in Europe, including those with hybrid technologies. The guide specifically focuses on the electric passenger cars currently on the market, and describes how they work and the challenges and incentives in place they face in achieving their broader use. Sales and use of electric vehicles are increasing, but they currently only make up 1.2% of total passenger car sales in the EU. Current estimates also show that electric cars only account for 0.15% of Europe's total car fleet.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/electric-vehicles-will-help-the"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0226", "date": "2016-09-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Europe reduced use of ozone layer-harming chemicals in 2015", "text": "The report 'Ozone depleting substances 2015' has been published by the EEA to coincide with the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer. Stratospheric ozone absorbs most of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet light so it does not reach the surface of the planet, helping prevent skin cancers and other problems such as damage to crops and marine phytoplankton. Some chemicals, also known as ozone depleting substances (ODS), harm the ozone layer. They have been successfully substituted in most parts of the world since 1989 when the Montreal Protocol came into force.\u00a0\u00a0 Within the European Union (EU), the phase-out of ODS use is established through the ODS Regulation. Companies are obliged to report data on production, import, export and destruction, which is used to calculate \u2018consumption\u2019, the key metric tracking progress under the Protocol. Consumption can be negative, if the amounts of controlled substances produced and imported are lower than those exported or destroyed. In 2015, the ODS consumption reached the lowest negative level since 2006 measured in metric tonnes. The value (\u2013\u00a03 808 metric tonnes) was 1 305 metric tonnes lower than in 2014. A significant contributing factor to the low consumption was a 12 % decrease in imports compared to 2014. Moreover, destruction of controlled substances increased between 2014 and 2015. About ozone depleting substances The Montreal Protocol covers over 200 individual substances, including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). These were formerly mainly used as refrigerants, propellants in spray cans, foam blowing agents, solvents and fire extinguishers. The data collected on these chemicals are expressed not only in metric tonnes, but also in 'ozone depleting potential' (ODP) tonnes, which show quantities in terms of their environmental effects rather than physical weight.

It also analyses the current design and application of environmental taxes in EEA member countries and considers future prospects. Energy, carbon and vehicle transport are the areas where environmental taxes are most commonly used and where the largest amount of revenue is generated. The analysis shows that resource and pollution taxes exist in the majority of the Member States and their \u00a0revenue is limited, but they have a big potential to change behaviour towards circular economy and resource efficiency The report stresses the value that environmental taxes play in decoupling pollution and resource use from economic development. For example, in Sweden, GDP has grown by 58% between 1990 and 2013 since the introduction of a carbon dioxide tax that contributed to a 23% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions over the same period. Such taxes also contribute to healthier living and can spur eco-friendly technology and innovations that generate wealth and jobs. These in turn help Europe\u2019s goal in moving toward a low-carbon and resource-efficient economy and in supporting the EU\u2019s policies on growth, competitiveness and jobs and its Europe 2020 strategy aims. Environmental taxes are less distorting towards economic behaviour compared with labour and corporate taxes. They also have lower evasion rates and administrative costs. Looking ahead, the report considers that improving environmental performance alongside demographic changes poses systemic challenges for policy makers in the field of taxation. New low-emission and low-carbon technologies in the industrial and transport sectors can lead to the erosion of the current tax bases in European countries. For example, the Dutch car registration tax scheme has influenced car buyers to purchase smaller, lower carbon emitting vehicles, which in turn has led to a reduction in tax revenues. Transport fuel tax revenues will also decrease when petrol and diesel sales fall as the EU moves towards its climate policy targets. At the same time, the share of the population that is elderly (> 65) will increase while the level of labour supply (age group 15-64) will decrease in most countries leading to a potential reduction in revenues from labour taxes. The report recommends considering these and related challenges such as economic competitiveness and distributional implications together when policymakers study the potential for tax-shifting programmes between labour and environmental taxes in the design of resilient, long-term tax systems for a future green economy. Other key findings The report identifies 18 binding and 24 non-binding market-based instruments like levies, permits or taxes based on EU environmental legislation currently in force across EEA member countries. Environmental tax revenue at the EU-28 level increased by 9.5% in real terms between 2002 and 2014 (an average increase of 0.8% per year). There are differences between EEA member countries in terms of environmental tax revenues. In 2014, Denmark had the highest revenues percentage to GDP (4.1%) followed by Slovenia (3.9%), Croatia (3.9%) and Greece (3.7%). The EU 28 Member State average stood at 2.5% in 2014 compared with 2.3% in 2008. \u00a0 Environmental tax revenues as a percentage of GDP in EU Member States, Norway and Switzerland, 1995\u20132014", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/designing-tax-systems-for-a"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0228", "date": "2016-07-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Air pollution from agriculture: EU exceeds international limit in 2014", "text": "Around 94% of ammonia (NH3) emissions in Europe stem from agriculture, mainly from activities such as manure storage, slurry spreading and the use of fertilisers containing nitrogen. Ammonia contributes to eutrophication \u2014 an oversupply of nitrogen \u2014 and acidification of ecosystems. It also forms particulate matter in the atmosphere which harms human health. The\u00a0Gothenburg Protocol to the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) contains emission reduction commitments that have to be met from 2010 onwards for NH3 and three other air pollutants: nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), and sulphur oxides (SOx). In addition to emission reduction commitments specified for individual countries, the protocol also specifies reduction commitments for the EU-15. The annual European Union emission inventory report 1990-2014 under the LRTAP Convention shows that NH3 emissions fell by 24% between 1990 and 2014, but increased in the EU\u201128 between 2013 and 2014 by 0.9%. Ammonia emissions from the EU-15 in 2014 were 0.2% higher than the 2010 limit, the first time the EU-15 has exceeded its emission ceiling for this pollutant. The rise in NH3 emissions in 2014 was mainly due to increases in France, Germany and Spain. Four countries (Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain) also exceeded their individual NH3 ceilings in 2014. (see Figure ES.5). More generally, some countries have also recently improved their estimates of NH3\u00a0released from agricultural sources which in some instances has led to an increase in the emissions reported from past years. Better reporting by Member States, including the reporting of new emissions sources, is encouraged. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Emissions of the other main pollutants covered by LRTAP have dropped considerably since 1990, including the three air pollutants primarily responsible for the formation of ground-level ozone (O3). Carbon monoxide (CO), NMVOCs and NOx were reduced by 65%, 60% and 55%, respectively. Other key findings Across the EU-28, SOx emissions have fallen the most with an 88% reduction since 1990. This is a result of a combination of measures including a shift from fuels with high sulphur content towards low-sulphur fuels such as natural gas, flue-gas desulphurisation in industrial facilities and EU directives relating to the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels. Emissions of primary particulate matter PM10 and PM2.5 have fallen by 23% and 25%, respectively since 2000, and black carbon (BC) by 42%. Emissions of heavy metals such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg), as well as the organic pollutants dioxins and furans, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have also dropped substantially since 1990, by about 66\u00a0% or more. The EEA member countries Norway and Switzerland, also have emission ceilings specified under the Gothenburg Protocol. In 2014, Norway exceeded its NH3\u00a0ceiling. Switzerland complied with all its ceilings. Background The Gothenburg Protocol to the LRTAP Convention aims to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution. It sets emission \u2018ceilings\u2019 or limits for a range of air pollutants that have to be met from 2010 onwards. In addition to ceilings specified for individual countries, the 1999 protocol also specifies ceilings for the EU-15. The protocol was amended in 2012 with new emission reduction commitments for 2020 and beyond. The EU-28 has not yet ratified the amended protocol. Parties to the protocol are allowed to \u2018adjust\u2019 their emission estimates to take into account certain changes that have occurred since the emission reduction commitments were originally agreed (for instance, the reporting of emission sources that were unknown at the time the reduction commitments were agreed). For comparisons against the protocol ceilings for 2010, the EEA has taken into account the approved adjusted emission inventory data reported by Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany Luxembourg and Spain. The EEA assists the EU by preparing the emissions\u00a0inventory to be reported under the LRTAP Convention each year.

The report outlines the changes and socio-economic challenges cities face due to climate change, and the possible consequences. It analyses the approaches cities can take to adaptation and explains that short-term coping or incremental adaptation measures alone will not be enough to mitigate the threats. The report recommends that the best way to meet these challenges is to take a wider systemic approach that addresses the root causes of vulnerability to climate change. This includes better urban planning, with more green areas that can retain excess rainwater or cool built-up city cores in the summer, or by preventing the construction of houses in flood-prone areas. This approach can transform cities into much more attractive, climate-resilient and sustainable places. European cities are increasingly susceptible to the negative aspects of climate change, which are expected to increase in frequency and intensity with extreme events such as heatwaves, flooding, water scarcity and droughts. At the same time, socio-economic and demographic developments can make cities more vulnerable. These will have profound impacts on a wide range of city functions, infrastructure and services such as energy, transport, and water and will affect the quality of life. According to the report, 100 cities, including Copenhagen, Rotterdam, Barcelona, Bologna and Bratislava, have already started to look at their vulnerability to climate change. They have developed plans and strategies and started implementing them. Governments and organisations at EU, national and regional levels have also developed political and legislative frameworks for cities to implement adaptation measures \u2013 among them the EU Adaptation Strategy and the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy initiative. \u00a0However, more needs to be done, as many more cities are not yet planning for climate change, the report says.

To accelerate the transition towards a low-carbon society, we need to further boost our investments in technology and innovation aimed at reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The figures come from the EU annual greenhouse gas inventory\u00a0submitted to the United Nations. In absolute terms, greenhouse gas emissions have decreased by 1383 million tonnes (Mt) in the EU since 1990, reaching 4282 Mt of CO2 equivalents in 2014. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \"It is positive that Europe has been able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions substantially since 1990. It is an important step towards reaching our 2030 and 2050 climate targets. To accelerate the transition towards a low-carbon society, we need to further boost our investments in technology and innovation aimed at reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.\" The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the 24-year period was due to a variety of factors, including the growing share in the use of renewables, the use of less carbon intensive fuels and improvements in energy efficiency, as well as to structural changes in the economy and the economic recession. Demand for energy to heat households has also been lower, as Europe on average has experienced milder winters since 1990, which has also helped reduce emissions according to an analysis linked to the inventory.\u00a0 Other findings The overall reduction of 24.4% in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 23% including international aviation, was accompanied by a 47% increase in gross domestic product (GDP). GHG emissions decreased in the majority of sectors between 1990 and 2014. Emission reductions were largest for manufacturing industries and construction (-372 Mt), electricity and heat production (-346 Mt), and residential combustion (-140 Mt). Not all sectors were able to reduce emissions. Road transport, responsible for the largest increase in CO2 emissions, grew by 124 Mt from 1990-2014, and 7 Mt from 2013-14. Emissions from international transport (aviation and shipping), which are not included in national totals reported to UNFCCC, also increased substantially between 1990 and 2014 (93 Mt). Emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which is a group of GHG gases used in the production of cooling devices such as air conditioning systems and refrigerators, also increased (99 Mt). EU GHG emissions were cut by 185 Mt between 2013 and 2014 (4.1%). The reduction in emissions was mainly due to lower heat demand by households due to the very warm winter in Europe. The increase in non-combustible renewables, particularly from wind and solar power also contributed to lower emissions in 2014. \u00a0\u00a0 About the report The European Union greenhouse gas inventory\u00a0is an annual report compiled by the EEA covering emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases from 1990 to two years before the current year.

The report \u2018Quiet areas in Europe: the environment unaffected by noise pollution,\u2019 provides a first mapping assessment of potential quiet areas in Europe\u2019s rural regions. Approximately 18% of Europe\u2019s area can be considered quiet, but 33% is potentially affected by noise pollution, the report finds. The distribution of quiet areas is strongly related to population density and transport. Other factors such as elevation, distance from coastlines and land use also greatly influence the presence of human activity and noise. Countries with relatively low population densities, such as Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, have the highest proportion of quiet areas. The noisiest areas tend to be found in areas with higher population densities, such as Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Remote areas such as the Alpine region or near the Mediterranean coast also have a high proportion of quiet areas. Around 27% of Europe\u2019s protected Natura 2000 sites have large areas of quiet, although one fifth of protected sites are exposed to high levels of noise. Although some actions have been taken to protect quiet areas in the countryside, the report says more could be done to reduce noise pollution in these areas to protect human health and biodiversity. Such measures may include for example, the introduction of national or local legislation that restricts certain business or recreational activities in quiet areas. The impacts of environmental noise Environmental noise is one of the most pervasive pollutants in Europe. An EEA 2014 assessment estimated that at least one in four European citizens are exposed to noise from road traffic above EU thresholds, or a total of more than 125 million people. Harmful effects of noise pollution on humans include annoyance and sleep disturbance which can in turn result in more serious problems like hypertension or heart disease. There is also increasing scientific evidence regarding the harmful effects of anthropogenic noise on wildlife. In nature, many species rely on acoustic communication for important aspects of life, such as finding food or locating a mate. Noise pollution can potentially interfere with these functions. About this report The report builds on the \u2018Good practice guide on quiet areas\u2019, published by the EEA in 2014. That report proposed a method, the Quietness Suitability Index (QSI), allowing potential quiet areas to be identified in regions outside of cities and towns. The present report further develops and applies the QSI methodology to put together a quietness index map for Europe as a whole and for individual EEA member countries.

As of 2010, all Member States are required to meet their emission ceilings, but preliminary 2014 data and final data for 2010-13 in the EEA\u2019s new briefing \u2018NEC Directive reporting status 2015\u2019 shows that a number of countries consistently breached their limits for NOx, NMVOCs and NH3\u00a0in all these years. The main reasons for the exceedances are emissions from road transport (NOx) and agriculture (NH3). Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), the harmful component of NOx, directly harms health as high concentrations can cause inflammation of the airways leading to respiratory conditions and cardiovascular disease. In addition, NOx\u00a0forms fine particulate matter and ozone in the atmosphere. Both pollutants have adverse effects on human health. NH3, which mainly stems from the use of fertilisers and the handling of animal manure, also forms particulate matter in the atmosphere. Moreover, both pollutants have impacts on ecosystems as they contain nitrogen.\u00a0 Key findings In 2014, 10 Member States reported emission data under the NECD that were above the ceiling for at least one pollutant. Germany was the only Member State that exceeded three out of its four emission ceilings in 2014 (NOx, NMVOCs and NH3). Since 2010, 10 Member States have persistently exceeded their respective emission ceilings for NOx\u00a0(Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland and Luxembourg), NMVOCs (Denmark, Germany, Ireland and Luxembourg) and NH3\u00a0(Austria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain). The SO2\u00a0ceilings emissions were not exceeded by any Member State during the period 2010-2014. The EU-28 as a whole did not exceed its aggregated emission ceilings for any of the four air pollutants in 2014.

Revision of the National Emission Ceilings Directive A revised National Emission Ceilings Directive was proposed by the European Commission as part of its 2013\u00a0Clean Air Policy Programme. The proposal, which included new 2020 and 2030 reduction commitments for the four currently-covered pollutants, as well as new ceilings for two additional pollutants \u2013 fine particulate matter (PM2,5) and methane (CH4), is currently being negotiated by the European Parliament and Member States under the Dutch EU Presidency.

The report builds on a survey, in which 32 of the 39 EEA member and cooperating countries took part. Countries provided detailed information on their resource efficiency polices and examples of good practice initiatives. The main objective of the report is to encourage countries to share information and their experiences in the development of resource efficiency policies. The work contributes to broadening know-how on resource efficiency and the circular economy and increases understanding of policy approaches in these areas. Between 2000 and 2014, resource use in the European Union as a whole fell both in absolute terms (down by 12%) and per person (from 15.5 to 13.1 tonnes per person), according to the survey. The economic benefit of improving resource efficiency is the most important driver in many countries, indicating that the logic of doing more with less has been widely embraced. The most recurrent drivers to improve efficiency were the desire to increase competitiveness, to secure the supply of raw materials and energy and reduce dependence on imports, and to lower pressures on the environment. The report stresses that the key challenge will be to ensure that the recent gains in efficiency are sustained, and that the situation does not revert to the long-term pattern of economic growth accompanied by increasing resource use. The survey also concludes that there is room for improvement in policy design and implementation, as well as significant potential benefit in the exchange of good practice, since big differences between countries still exist. The report and the accompanying 32 individual country profiles were produced together with the Agency\u2019s network of member and cooperating countries, known as Eionet and the European Topic Centre on Waste and Materials in a Green Economy (ETC/WMGE).\u00a0 Key Findings: Only three countries, Austria, Finland and Germany, adopted dedicated national strategies for material resource efficiency. Two further countries have dedicated strategies at a regional level, in Flanders (Belgium), and Scotland (United Kingdom). Most of the improvements in resource productivity occurred between 2007 and 2014, although not necessarily as a result of a comprehensive policy intervention. The gains were mostly due to the sharp decline in construction activity as a result of the economic crisis that started in 2007-2008, which led to huge falls in material use, but had rather limited impact on gross domestic product. A majority of countries (26) identified certain waste streams and secondary materials as the most common group of priority materials. Key waste streams are plastic and packaging (17 countries), construction and demolition waste (16 countries), and food waste (15 countries). Energy sources, like fossil fuels and including renewables, were mentioned by 18 countries as priority resources. Manufacturing was singled out most frequently as the key economic sector for improving material resource efficiency, followed by agriculture and forestry, construction, and waste management. The service sector \u2014 currently accounting for some 70\u201375 % of GDP in most European countries \u2014 is potentially significant with respect to material use and the resource efficiency of the economy. However, very few countries mentioned service-oriented sectors among their priorities for improving material resource efficiency. Nine countries have adopted national targets for material resource efficiency: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia. In most cases, these targets are based on gross domestic product relative to domestic material consumption (GDP/DMC) \u2014 the EU's lead resource productivity indicator. Germany, the Netherlands, and the region of Flanders (Belgium) reported having a dedicated circular economy strategy, which aims to create a production and consumption system that generates little waste and keeps materials in use for as long as possible. Several countries acknowledge the need to move away from the current linear economic model and stated that the circular economy and closing material loops are already policy priorities. The majority of reported policy initiatives related to the circular economy focus on waste management, with only a few examples going beyond increasing recycling rates and a higher use of secondary raw materials.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/resource-efficiency-in-europe-benefits"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0236", "date": "2016-06-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Better targeted measures needed to tackle urban sprawl in Europe", "text": "The report, Urban sprawl in Europe, reviews the low-density and scattered expansion of many cities that often comes as a result of uncontrolled growth, which has continued in Europe over recent decades. Urban sprawl involves the expansion of large urban areas into surrounding undeveloped areas including the countryside and agricultural land. According to the report, the level of sprawl increased in all European countries in the 2000s and it continues to grow. The report underlines the need for better policy measures and knowledge tools to address urban sprawl\u2019s negative impacts. The report aims to support more sustainable political decision making and better urban planning across Europe. Impacts of urban sprawl While scattered housing and commercial developments have been associated with a number of positive economic and social effects, it also has negative ones, including \u2018detrimental and long-lasting effects\u2019 on the environment. The study says that urban sprawl contributes significantly to the loss of fertile farmland, soil sealing and the loss of essential ecological functions. The increase in built up areas has led to higher greenhouse gas emissions, higher infrastructure costs for transport, water and electricity, and the loss of open landscapes. It has also reduced the size of wildlife habitats as urban development and roads break up the landscape into ever-smaller pieces, with potentially devastating consequences for biodiversity and ecosystems. Urban sprawl also has socio-economic impacts. It increases the demand for infrastructure such as roads, and it makes people more dependent on cars which poses a burden on household budgets. Urban sprawl also has a cascading effect on daily life in areas with low level of services and health in terms of air pollution, stress and accidents.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The study stresses that there is a need to encourage positive development methods like improving the density of existing residential areas within cities to better contain or reduce sprawl, rather than encouraging dispersed urban development that promotes outlying building zones, which lead to new traffic and transport bottlenecks. Dispersed urban development can lead to a negative circular pattern, where the constant expansion of road networks is used to offset the traffic urban sprawl can cause, and where new roads lead to more sprawl, creating a locked-in development loop. Four essential measures should be reinforced to support policy interventions: Better monitoring of urban sprawl, Applying a \u2018sprawl analysis\u2019 as a tool in urban, regional and transport planning to assess consequences of projects and zoning, Setting up targets, limits and benchmarks to control sprawl, Strengthening regional planning to encourage sustainable land use. Key findings The two largest clusters of high urban sprawl in Europe are located in north-eastern France, Belgium, the Netherlands and part of western German and in the United Kingdom between London and the Midlands. Urban sprawl is most pronounced in wide rings around city centres, along large transport corridors and along many coastlines, particularly in Mediterranean countries. Lowest levels of sprawl are mainly found in mountain ranges or remote areas. Best practices to keep urban sprawl in check or compensate by re-use of already developed land can help reduce land uptake and prevent urban sprawl. Countryside can be preserved through functional zones and spatial plans that determine housing limits and offer for stakeholder consultation, as well as the creation of public green areas with building restrictions. More in-depth research is needed on urban sprawl, notably on how it developed over time, the history and the political and economic conditions that led to its development, and a deeper statistical analysis of the drivers of urban sprawl. A variety of factors such as a higher income, possession and use of cars, the preference for detached housing, and a change in lifestyle or demography, drives the proliferation of urban sprawl. Political drivers play a key role. Policies have the power to prevent or moderate urban sprawl. The report analyses in detail a significant and illustrative period, 2006-2009, which saw urban sprawl increased by 5% in the three years or by 1.7% per year, according to a calculation using the weighted urban proliferation method. Methodology The report investigated the degree of urban sprawl in 32 countries in Europe in 2006 and in 2009, and assessed the problem based on data taken at three levels: national, regional and at the 1-km2 cell level. The analysis used the so-called \u2018weighted urban proliferation\u2019 method which quantifies the degree of urban sprawl for any given landscape taking into account the size and dispersion of built-up areas, and the uptake of built-up area per inhabitant or job. By offering new analytical approaches, the report presents advanced contribution to the methods of land monitoring.

More and more bathing waters have not only reached the minimum requirements, but have improved to excellent standards. In some cities, people can even enjoy swimming in public harbour baths. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The annual bathing water report from the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Commission assesses bathing water quality in 2015, indicating where it is expected to be good in 2016. The report compiles analyses of water sampled at more than 21 000 coastal and inland bathing sites across the EU, Switzerland and Albania indicating whether or not it has been contaminated by faecal pollution from sewage or livestock. While 96 % of bathing sites met the minimum requirements, more than 84 % met the more stringent \u2018excellent\u2019 level. Several large tourist areas and cities like Blackpool, Copenhagen and Munich are also starting to benefit from investments in improved sewage systems, which are leading to cleaner bathing sites at harbour areas, urban river locations and nearby beaches. Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, said: \u201cEuropean bathing water is at 96 % acceptable and 84 % excellent standards. That is the result of 40 years investing in water and waste water infrastructure. It is a sign of EU legislation working well. And it is a perfect testimony to the fact that a highly evolved economic area such as ours can produce equally high environmental standards.\u201d Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cOur assessment shows that bathing water quality has improved remarkably over the years. More and more bathing waters have not only reached the minimum requirements, but have improved to excellent standards. In some cities, people can even enjoy swimming in public harbour baths.\u201d Overall bathing water has improved over time. In 1991, 56 % of bathing water sites reached the highest standards. This percentage rose to 87 % in 2015, based on nearly 9 600 bathing water sites that have been monitored every year during this period. Other key findings More than 90 % of bathing sites in eight Member States had excellent water quality in 2015: Luxembourg (all 11 reported bathing water sites), Cyprus (99.1 % of bathing water sites), Malta (97.7 %), Greece (97.2 %), Croatia (94.2 %), Italy (90.6 %), Germany (90.3 %) and Austria (90.2 %). Across Europe, only 385 bathing sites were assessed as having poor bathing water quality in 2015. The share of bathing water sites rated \u2018poor\u2019 dropped to 1.6 % in 2015 from 1.9 % in 2014. The highest numbers of bathing sites with poor water quality were found in Italy (95 bathing sites, 1.7 %), France (95 bathing sites, 2.8 %) and Spain (58 bathing sites, 2.6 %). The share of bathing water with excellent quality increased from 78 % in 2011 to 84 % in 2015. Background For recreational activities such as swimming, faecal contamination is a cause of concern for public health. Swimming at contaminated beaches or bathing lakes can result in illness. The major sources of pollution are sewage and water draining from farms and farmland. Such pollution increases during heavy rains and floods due to sewage overflow and polluted drainage water being washed into rivers and seas. Forty years ago, large quantities of uncontrolled, untreated or partially treated wastewater were discharged into many of Europe\u2019s waters. The 2015 bathing season was the first time that all EU Member States monitored their bathing sites according to the provisions of the EU's revised Bathing Water Directive (2006/7/EC). The directive specifies if the bathing water quality can be classified as \u2018excellent\u2019, \u2018good\u2019, \u2018sufficient\u2019 or \u2018poor\u2019 depending on the levels of faecal bacteria detected.

While the reported annual reduction is small, emissions are nevertheless well below the EU\u2019s 2017 target of 175 g CO2/km. This target was already met in 2013. Further efficiency improvements still need to be achieved to reach the EU\u2019s more stringent target of 147 g CO2/km set for 2020. Key findings:\u00a0 In 2015, 1.5 million new vans were registered in the EU, an increase of 2 % compared to the previous year. More new vans were sold in most Member States. However, three Member States reported lower sales: Poland (-24 %), Spain (-16 %) and France (-12 %). Three out of five new vans (i.e. 60 %) registered in the EU were sold in just three Member States: the United Kingdom (24 %), France (21 %) and Germany (15%). The average fuel-efficiency of new vans varied widely across Member States due to the different models and sizes of vehicles sold in each country. Average emissions were lowest in Portugal (141.7 g CO2/km), Cyprus (143.2 g CO2/km) and Bulgaria (143.9 g CO2/km) and highest in Slovakia (186.6 g CO2/km), Germany (186.4 g CO2/km) and the Czech Republic (182.6 g CO2/km). The average weight of vans sold also varied across countries. Smaller vehicles were sold in Malta, Bulgaria and Portugal (< 1 585 kg); larger vehicles (>1 940 kg) in Poland, Finland and Slovakia. Only 10 250 electric and plug-in hybrid vans were sold in 2015, representing 0.7 % of the total EU van sales. This is lower than the 184\u00a0000 electric and plug-in hybrid passenger cars sold the same year, a share of 1.3% of total car sales. Diesel vehicles continue to make up the vast majority of the new van fleet, constituting 97 % of sales. Background The EEA collects and regularly publish data on new light commercial vehicles registered in Europe, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 510/2011. The data reported by all Member States in order to evaluate the efficiency of the new vehicle fleet includes information on CO2 emissions and vehicle weight. It has not yet been confirmed whether different manufacturers have met their own specific annual targets, based on the average weight of the light commercial vehicles they sell. Part of the reason for the small annual reduction observed in 2015 was due to regulatory changes in France. Companies can no longer register company cars as light commercial vehicles as a result of which the share of lower emitting vehicles in the total number of newly registered vans in France has decreased. The EEA will publish the final data on manufacturers\u2019 individual performances as well as additional assessment of the data in the autumn. Manufacturers now have three months to verify the preliminary data and notify errors to the European Commission. Member States report new vehicles\u2019 CO2 emission levels, measured under standardised laboratory conditions, following the requirements of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test procedure. This procedure is designed to allow a comparison of emissions for different manufacturers. However, there is now wide recognition that the NEDC test procedure, dating from the 1970s, is out-dated and does not necessarily represent real-world driving conditions and emissions due inter alia to a number of flexibilities that allow vehicle manufacturers to optimise the conditions under which their vehicles are tested. Recognising these shortcomings, in January 2016 the European Commission proposed a number of changes to the current vehicle type-approval framework. A new procedure known as the \u2018Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure\u2019 (WLTP) will be introduced in the future so that laboratory results better represent actual vehicle performance on the road.

Land take can lead to land degradation and have a negative impact on the natural functioning of soils. Land take involves soil sealing, which can lead to soil biodiversity loss. Land degradation includes erosion and the loss of organic matter in the soils. These have a knock-on effect on ecosystems, food production and the regulation of water. The EEA report checks the EU\u2019s four biggest policies \u2014 the Cohesion Policy, Transport Policy, Energy Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy \u2014 to see how they affect land use across Europe. \u00a0The analysis was carried out based on an approach or methodology that looked at a set of evaluation criteria, including evidence of impacts, relevance, coherence, effectiveness, and EU added value. The initial evaluation found that the policies would be more effective if they better balance environmental concerns with other priorities. This can be done with the use of targets to improve the balance between demand and supply of available land. This would also help EU-wide efforts to protect land and the environment. The report also considers EU objectives related to land take and land degradation under the EU\u2019s 7th Environment Action Programme, which aims to protect land and soil for future generations. EU objectives include setting a target of \u2018no net land take\u2019 by 2050; reducing soil erosion; increasing soil organic matter; remediating contaminated sites; and integrating land use concerns into all levels of government, including via the adoption of targets on soil and land as a resource. The analysis also draws on two in-depth case studies, assessing the impacts of EU Cohesion Policy, and specifically spending for transport on land in Poland, and the role of EU policies in land take and land degradation impacts in the region of Andalusia, Spain. Key Findings The evaluation highlights the need to further integrate EU land objectives in the four policy areas. The report identified the increased covering up of soil by concrete or pavement (soil sealing), the fragmentation of the landscape due to transport networks, and land degradation due to intensive agriculture and biofuel production, as key challenges. The four EU policies have major impacts on land use. And all four provide an opportunity to integrate better land use practices across the entire EU, and across borders. Without these EU policies, coherent and effective integration of land use practices cannot be possible. Future policy making on land should consider setting targets on better land use as part of new EU policy on land as a resource. These can help prevent degradation and other negative impacts. The use of environmental impact assessments should be reinforced.

Soil is a core component of the land system and plays a central role in the functioning of our ecosystems. Humans derive a range of valuable services from soil, although the contribution of the soil resource is often indirect and somewhat hidden. Especially in urban areas, the essential role that soil plays to our everyday lives and to other living things on our planet is often underestimated. City landscapes often entail that soil is covered up by cement, asphalt, buildings and other man-made structures, or used as dumping grounds for pollutants. The covering up of soil (soil sealing) and local soil contamination are the two top threats to the quality of soils in urban areas. The report highlights that the compaction of soil, or the increased densification of soil grains also present problems, especially in preventing the proper absorption of water. Soil underpins 90% of all human food and is essential for water and ecosystem health. But it is also a key resource to the viability of cities. The report highlights that the services provided by soil in cities go far beyond the basic ingredients in the creation of green infrastructure like parks, or playgrounds. Soil helps maintain biodiversity and serves important cultural functions such as hosting cemeteries or being an archive of human activity. Urban soils hold other man-made infrastructure like sewage systems or underground transport systems. Unsealed land in cities also plays a key function in helping to mitigate the effects of climate change. Uncovered soil acts as a regulator of water runoff and can help to prevent flooding. It also helps to regulate often hotter temperatures in city cores and can store carbon. Some European Member States already have policy targets for monitoring and reversing the covering up of soil in urban areas as well as for dealing with soil contamination. Key findings Policies and regulations for urban areas, including those that apply to spatial planning, should ensure that soils are protected in the interest of the public, based on \u201ca sound understanding of the functions and values of soils.\u201d In addition to its ecological and economic benefits, the soil\u2019s value to fulfil human needs should also be considered. Soil should be seen as a limited resource and not as waste. Soil management, including its reuse and recycling, should be an integral part of city planning and construction projects. High-quality soil within urbanised areas should be protected for possible agricultural use. More information and knowledge is needed for city planners, to raise awareness of the use value of soil towards building a green economy, supportive of human well-being and ecosystem resilience.

On average, the heaviest cars were sold in Sweden and Luxembourg (1 530 kg and 1 496 kg respectively) whereas Maltese, Danish and Greek buyers preferred lighter cars (1 199, 1 233 and 1 260 kg respectively). The average diesel vehicle sold was 311 kg heavier than the average petrol vehicle. The least fuel-efficient cars were bought in Estonia and Latvia (137 g CO2/km) followed by Bulgaria (130 g CO2/km). For all remaining Member States, the average emission levels were below 130 g\u00a0CO2/km. As seen in 2014, the Netherlands (101.2 g CO2/km) was the country that registered the most efficient new cars. Portugal and Denmark followed with new cars emitting on average 106 g CO2/km. Diesel cars remain the most sold vehicles in the EU, constituting 52% of sales. As in past years, the countries with the highest proportions of diesel sales include Ireland and Luxembourg (71%), Portugal (69%), and Croatia, Greece and Spain (63%). The average fuel efficiency of petrol cars (122.6 g CO2/km) has been catching up with the fuel-efficiency of diesel cars (119.2 g CO2/km) in recent years. Sales of plug-in hybrids and battery-electric vehicles continued to increase. The relative share of plug-in hybrids and battery-electric vehicle sales was highest in the Netherlands and Denmark, reaching 12% and 8\u200a% respectively of national car sales in 2015. However, sales of such vehicles still remain a small fraction of total sales, accounting for just 1.3 % of all new EU cars sold. Around 57 000 pure battery-electric vehicles were registered in 2015, a 50% increase compared to 2014. The largest number of registrations were recorded in France (more than 17 650 vehicles), Germany (more than 12 350 vehicles) and the UK (more than 9 900 vehicles). \u00a0 EEA activities The EEA collects and regularly makes available data on new passenger vehicles registered in Europe, in accordance with EU Regulation (EC) No 443/2009. The data reported by all Member States in order to evaluate the efficiency of the new vehicle fleet includes information on CO2 emissions and vehicle weight. It has not yet been confirmed whether different manufacturers have met their own specific annual targets, based on the average weight of the cars they sell. The EEA will publish the final data on manufacturers\u2019 individual performances in the autumn. Testing vehicle emissions Member States report new vehicles\u2019 CO2 emission levels, measured under standardised laboratory conditions, following the requirements of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test procedure. This procedure is designed to allow a comparison of emissions for different manufacturers. However, there is now wide recognition that the NEDC test procedure, dating from the 1970s, is out-dated and does not necessarily represent real-world driving conditions and emissions due inter alia to a number of flexibilities that allow vehicle manufacturers to optimise the conditions under which their vehicles are tested. The EEA has recently published a non-technical guide explaining the key reasons for the differences observed between official and real world driving emissions. Recognising these shortcomings, in January 2016 the European Commission proposed a number of changes to the current vehicle type-approval framework. A new procedure known as the \u2018Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure\u2019 (WLTP) will also be introduced in the future so that laboratory results better represent actual vehicle performance on the road.

The water exploitation index plus\u00a0(WEI+) of European River Basin Districts\u00a0is the percentage of total freshwater used compared to the renewable freshwater resources available. The EEA indicator shows that around 20 river basin districts, mainly in the Mediterranean, face structural water stress issues (WEI > 20 %). These include Cyprus, Malta, Crete, the Balearic Islands and Sicily. The situation is even worse in summer. The average WEI for the summers 2002-2012 were 81 % and 55 % for Cyprus and Segura, Spain respectively which suggests severe water stress and clearly unsustainable resource use. Water stress, increasingly, occurs in other parts of Europe. The main drivers are growing urban populations and higher living standards coupled with reduced water availability due to pollution and drought. Many large cities have developed wide networks for transporting water, often over distances of more than 100-200 km to be able to respond to the demand for water. Other key findings During winter, approximately 30 million inhabitants\u00a0live under water stress conditions, while the figure for summer is around 70 million. This corresponds to 6 % and 14 % of the total population of Europe respectively. Agriculture accounts for\u00a036 % of total water use on an annual scale. In summer, this increases to about 60 %. Agriculture in the Mediterranean region alone accounts for almost 75 % of total water used for agriculture in Europe. Around 20 % of the total population of the Mediterranean region\u00a0live under permanent water stress conditions.\u00a0More than half (53 %) of the Mediterranean population is effected by water stress\u00a0during the summer. \u00a0 Public water supply is second to agriculture, accounting for 32 % of total water use. The service sector, including businesses dealing with tourism, has become one of the main pressures on renewable water resources, accounting for 11 % of total annual water use. Small Mediterranean islands in particular are under severe water stress conditions due to\u00a0receiving 10-15 times more tourists than they have local inhabitants.

It assesses whether forest ecosystems can still manage to play their part providing key \u2018services\u2019 for the environment. Forests help regulate our climate and sustain watersheds, providing clean water. They also act as \u2018carbon sinks\u2019, clean the air we breathe and help preserve and protect biodiversity as many species depend on forests for their home. There is a growing awareness of the important role forests play in mitigating climate change, in particular after the climate talks in Paris (COP21). The report identifies habitat loss and degradation, the risk posed by invasive alien species, pollution and climate change as the top four challenges European forests face today. These threats, combined with economic activities such as logging, urban sprawl, or the increasing use of forests by humans for leisure, make forests more vulnerable to degradation. To tackle these problems and to improve the protection of forests, the report calls for enhanced research and data collection on a European level, tapping into national forest inventories and monitoring to better track changes in forest cover and conditions. It also calls for EU policies to take forest activities more into account. Enhanced coordination among stakeholders, forest owners, timber industry, policy makers, and the general public is needed to improve the sustainable management of forests, not only when it comes to timber production but also on the use of forests for other ecosystem services. Other findings Forests remain the dominant natural habitat across most of Europe. In 2015, forests and other wooded land covered more than 40% of the total land surface in the 33 member countries and six cooperating countries of the EEA. This is equal to 186 million hectares (ha). Almost 70% of forested areas in Europe is within six countries: Sweden (28 million ha), Finland (22 million ha), Spain (18 million ha), France (17 million ha), Norway and Turkey (both 12 million ha). Climate change is likely to have a significant impact both on the zones where tree species can live and the range of tree species that can thrive in Europe. Increased periods of droughts and warmer winters are expected to further weaken forests against invasive species and make trees more susceptible to disease, pests and pathogens. European forests have increased in area since 1990. The increase in forest cover is likely due to the natural expansion of forests and afforestation on farmland in rural and remote areas. For the 2007-2012 period, the 27 EU Member States reported that only 26% of forest species and 15% of forest habitats of European interest, as listed in the EU\u2019s Habitats Directive, were in \u2018favorable conservation status.\u2019 Recent reports by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) indicate that 27% of mammals, 10% of reptiles and 8% of amphibians linked to forests are threatened with extinction within the EU.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/is-europe-doing-enough-to"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0245", "date": "2016-03-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Renewables increasingly curbing reliance on fossil fuels", "text": "The EEA report \u2018Renewable energy in Europe 2016: recent growth and knock-on effects,\u2019 shows that clean and renewable energy sources are being widely embraced. The EU-wide share of renewable energy has increased from 14.3% in 2012 to 15% in 2013. Based on preliminary data for 2014, the EEA had estimated further growth in the share of renewable energy at 15.2%. This upward trend was recently confirmed by Eurostat (16%) showing growth which was even stronger than anticipated. The additional consumption of renewable energy, compared to the level of consumption in 2005, has allowed the EU to cut its demand for fossil fuels by 110 Million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2013. This is equivalent to a gross reduction of carbon dioxide emissions of 362 Million tonnes (Mt) in 2013. The data shows that renewable energy sources are playing a key part in Europe\u2019s energy transition and are complementing climate change mitigation policies while improving Europe\u2019s overall energy security. Europe is playing a leading role in developing clean energy sources. Throughout 2005-2014, Europe had the highest shares of global new investments in renewable energy technologies, being surpassed by China only in 2013. The EU is also one of the key players with regard to employment in the renewable energy sector. As renewables growth is picking up also in other parts of the world, the EU needs to sustain and increase its efforts to support and develop renewable energy sources in order to maintain its competitive advantage. However, certain forms of renewable energy can impact health and the environment such as traditional use of biomass or large infrastructure projects such as hydroelectricity. Other findings Coal was the fuel most substituted by renewables across Europe in 2013 and in 2014, (roughly 45% of all avoided fossil fuels) followed by natural gas (roughly 29% of all avoided fossil fuels). The uptake of renewable energy sources vary widely among EU Member States, ranging from more than 30% of gross final energy consumption in Sweden (52.1%), Latvia (37.1%) and Finland (36.8%) in 2013, to less than 5% in Luxembourg (3.6%), Malta (3.8%) and the Netherlands (4.5%). As a result of national growth in the consumption of renewable energy since 2005, Germany, Italy and Spain achieved the largest reduction in domestic fossil fuel use and gross avoided greenhouse gas emissions in 2013. The EU contributes significantly to the global roll-out of modern renewable energy technologies. In 2014, the EU had the largest installed and connected solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power capacities in the world. Since 2005, Europe has led the way in funding the development of renewable energy sources, with its share of investments in renewable energy fluctuating between 40-50% until 2011. Public funding in research and development of new renewable energy sources has increased between 2005 and 2013 but at a slower pace than before, posing a risk of missing the break-through technologies of tomorrow. The International Energy Agency has recommended the tripling of current public research and development spending on clean-energy innovation. This report is an update to last year\u2019s Renewable energy in Europe report (LINK) and shows in detail developments in renewable energy uptake since 2005.

It identifies key gaps in data which are essential to properly assess the health of Europe\u2019s many ecosystems. The report concludes improved mapping and assessments are needed in order to understand the problems faced by Europe\u2019s ecosystems and to restore these key life-sustaining systems to better health. This understanding is vital for policymakers to come up with suitable responses. The well-being of our societies is heavily dependent on our thriving ecosystems, which provide the basic building blocks of our day-to-day survival, including fertile soil, fresh water, pollination, natural flood protection and climate regulation. This \u2018natural capital\u2019 is being degraded or lost as a result of human activity. The report looks at eight broad ecosystem types in Europe: urban, cropland, grassland, heathland and shrub, woodland and forest, wetlands, freshwater, and marine. It assesses the pressures and challenges each of the different types face as well as the impacts on habitats and species. Key Findings An analysis of the data shows that some of the most sensitive ecosystems like heathlands, wetlands and freshwater bodies in Europe are highly concentrated in a small number of countries, which could increase their vulnerability to environmental change. \u00a0A substantial proportion of these very vulnerable ecosystems are not protected within Natura 2000 EU protected sites, Marine Protected Areas or similar zones that aim to preserve habitats and biodiversity. Well over half of all the habitats and species covered by the EU\u2019s Habitats Directive are assessed as being in \u2018unfavourable\u2019 condition, and their conservation status is generally declining or stable, with only a small proportion \u2018improving.\u2019 An initial assessment found that habitat change (including pollution, habitat loss and fragmentation) has had the greatest overall impact across ecosystems to date. Pressures like nutrient and pollution loads are still increasing and all ecosystem types are facing increased pressure due to climate change and invasive alien species, leading to further negative effects. Key gaps in knowledge and data will need to be resolved to improve future assessments of Europe\u2019s ecosystems. Specifically, there is a lack of data on urban and marine ecosystems, a lack of understanding of the combined impacts of multiple pressures faced, a lack of detailed spatial data for mapping impacts on biodiversity, and a lack of understanding of the links between ecosystem condition, biodiversity and ecosystem service delivery. The EEA has since 2012 supported the implementation of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 through its activities on ecosystem mapping and assessment.

This report explains in simple terms how vehicle emissions occur and how they are tested, and the reasons for the gap between tested and real-world driving emissions. EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx Despite improvements in vehicle efficiencies over past decades, EEA reports show that the road transport sector is responsible for almost one fifth of Europe\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. It also contributes to high concentrations of air pollutants above EU standards in many of Europe\u2019s cities. \u2018Measuring exhaust emissions from vehicles is a complex issue, and it\u2019s a topic that has been extensively discussed in the media over the past months,\u2019 said EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx. \u2018This report explains in simple terms how vehicle emissions occur and how they are tested, and the reasons for the gap between tested and real-world driving emissions.\u2019 The new report, \u2018Explaining road transport emissions: a non-technical guide\u2019, gives a simplified explanation of the often complex information available on road transport emissions as well as the technologies to reduce them. Standardised measurements are made in laboratories to check that vehicles meet the official requirements for exhaust emissions. However, the official procedures currently used in Europe are not representative of real driving conditions. For certain pollutants, there is a significant difference between official emission measurements and vehicle performance on the road. Nitrogen oxides (NOx), a major air pollutant which harms health and the environment, can be more than seven times higher under real world driving conditions for new vehicles than in official tests. New vehicles similarly can emit up to 40 % more carbon dioxide (CO2) than official measurements would indicate. The report outlines three main reasons for these discrepancies: An outdated test procedure used in Europe that does not reflect real-world driving conditions; Permitted \u2018flexibilities\u2019 in the current testing procedures that allow manufacturers to optimise certain testing conditions, and thereby achieve lower fuel consumption and CO2 emission values; Several in-use factors which are driver dependent (e.g. driving style) or independent (e.g. environmental conditions) The existing emissions test procedure permits a number of flexibilities which can be used to minimise measured emissions. In the future two important initiatives are planned in the European Union to help ensure an improved consistency between the official vehicle emissions and real-world driving performance. This includes updating the outdated official test procedure to one that is more representative of real-world emissions, as well as the introduction of a procedure for measuring the real driving NOx emissions of vehicles on the road.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/explaining-vehicle-emissions"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0248", "date": "2016-01-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Floodplain management: reducing flood risks and restoring healthy ecosystems", "text": "The floodplain is the area next to a river bed which is more or less frequently covered with water in times of high water discharges from adjacent rivers. Wetland is one type of floodplain. By retaining water, floodplains can buffer the effects of heavy rainfall and in this way protect economic activities and communities further downstream from flood damage. However, many former natural floodplains are under increased pressure from urban sprawl, infrastructure developments and agriculture. In Europe, up to 90% of floodplains have been lost during the past centuries or are no longer able to serve as functioning natural ecosystems providing flood risk reduction and habitats favouring a high biodiversity. The EEA report \u2018Flood risks and environmental vulnerability \u2014 Exploring the synergies between floodplain restoration, water policies and thematic policies\u2019 draws upon information published in the European flood impact database which covers floods reported between 1980 and 2010. The report highlights the benefits of an integrated approach to flood risk management and argues that a coordinated implementation of EU legislation, such as the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the Birds and Habitats Directives and the Floods Directive through coherent measures and actions, would enhance the effectiveness of the policies. The restoration of healthy ecosystems, for example through the Natura 2000 networks, is often a very effective way of preventing and mitigating floods. Even when 'hard' flood defences, such as dykes, are necessary to protect communities, those measures should be complemented with long-term nature-based solutions such as floodplain restoration. By 'greening the grey' and making a network of green infrastructures, the necessary protection levels can be combined with a minimum loss of habitats and a good preservation of ecosystem services. Other key findings Between 1980 and 2010, 37 European countries registered 3,563 floods in total. The highest number of floods was reported for 2010 (321 floods), when 27 countries were affected. This number is associated with the 'Central European floods', which occurred across several Central European countries during May and June 2010. Based on reporting from nine countries, the report maps the share of population living in floodplain areas. Among those countries, Italy has the largest population living in flood-prone areas (6.7 million people, 11% of the population) whereas Hungary has the highest relative share of people living in such areas (1.8 million, 18% of the population). Annual flood losses can be expected to increase fivefold by 2050 and up to 17\u2011fold by 2080. The major share of this increase (70\u201390%) is estimated to be attributable to socio\u2011economic development as the economic value of the assets in floodplains increases, and the remainder (10\u201330%) to climate change. Future extreme floods are likely to be the cost drivers for the adaptation of infrastructure. Ecosystem-based adaptation, nature-based solutions and green infrastructure are, in many cases, key in ensuring a cost-effective approach to an uncertain scenario by delaying or avoiding lock-ins to classic infrastructure-building water management. The report also notes that although strategies for flood risk management require measures that are specific to the local circumstances, using a river basin approach avoids passing on negative consequences further downstream.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/floodplain-management-reducing-flood-risks"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0249", "date": "2016-01-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Circular economy to have considerable benefits, but challenges remain", "text": "The concept of a circular economy has recently gained traction in European policy making as a positive, solutions-based perspective for achieving economic development while respecting environmental limits. The EEA is prepared to support the transition to a circular economy through analysis and assessments EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx The EEA report Circular economy in Europe - Developing the knowledge base describes the concept of the circular economy and outlines its key characteristics. Creating a circular economy requires fundamental changes throughout the value chain, from product design and production processes to new business models and consumption patterns. Recycling will turn waste into a resource and extending product lifetimes will help preserve natural resources. The European Commission\u2019s 2015 circular economy package plays an important role in bringing this about. \u2018The concept of a circular economy has recently gained traction in European policy making as a positive, solutions-based perspective for achieving economic development while respecting environmental limits. The EEA is prepared to support the transition to a circular economy through analysis and assessments,\u2019 said EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx. Unlike the traditional take-make-consume-dispose approach, a circular economy seeks to respect environmental boundaries through increasing the share of renewable or recyclable resources while reducing the consumption of raw materials and energy. Emissions and loss of resources will thus be reduced. Approaches such as eco-design, sharing, re-using, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing products and materials, will play a significant role in maintaining the use of products, components and materials and retaining their value. Key findings The benefits of a transition towards a circular economy in Europe could be considerable, reducing environmental pressures in Europe and beyond and minimising the continent\u2019s high and increasing dependence on imports. Increasingly, this dependence could be a source of vulnerability. Growing global competition for natural resources has contributed to marked increases in price levels and volatility. Circular economy strategies could also result in considerable cost savings, increasing the competitiveness of Europe\u2019s industry while delivering net benefits in terms of job opportunities. Challenges: As new circular approaches emerge, frictions between the existing linear system and the new approaches are bound to arise. These may be perceived as threats by some stakeholders, but as opportunities by others. Good practice examples exist. For instance, businesses are already employing or experimenting with new business models such as service- and function-based business models and collaborative consumption. Governments increasingly foster waste prevention, reuse and repair. A transition requires a substantial expansion of the knowledge base to chart progress and identify where more work is needed to achieve change. Some indicators exist already. For example, Europe is reducing the amount of waste generated and recycles more and more of its waste. But more information is needed to inform decision making and combine thinking about environmental, social and economic impacts. Better insight is needed in production structures and functions, consumption dynamics, finance and fiscal mechanisms, as well as triggers and pathways for technological and social innovations.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/circular-economy-to-have-considerable"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0250", "date": "2015-12-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Technological solutions and behavioural change needed to decarbonise transport", "text": "The transport sector affects the environment in different ways. It leads to emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and air pollutants, it is the main source of environmental noise and it leads to habitat fragmentation. The European Union has a wide range of policies from nature protection, noise, fuel quality to air quality, which have resulted in some significant improvements in environmental performance. For example, new cars and vans sold in Europe are using less fuel per kilometre, releasing less carbon dioxide and air pollutants. On the other hand, however, an increasing number of Europeans are buying cars, driving and travelling longer distances, and buying goods transported across the world. The EEA's new report 'TERM 2015, Evaluating 15 years of transport and environmental policy integration' analyses the evolution of the transport sector (freight and passenger) and its impacts on the environment since 2000, including the impacts of the economic recession in 2008. The report concludes that a fundamental decarbonisation of the transport sector will require not just technological solutions but also policies that stimulate significant behavioural changes, including the correct pricing of transport externalities and planning approaches that stimulate the use of sustainable modes of transport. Selected facts GHG emissions from transport increased by 19.4% since 1990. It is the only main European economic sector for which GHG emissions have increased. In 2013, transport accounted for almost one-quarter of the EU\u2019s total GHG emissions (one-fifth excluding international aviation and maritime emissions). Passenger cars contribute almost 45% and heavy duty vehicles a further 20% of the transport sector\u2019s emissions. As a result of EU legislation, transport emissions of three important air pollutants SOx, NOx and PM decreased in the period 2000 to 2013 in the EU. \u00a0Particularly for NOx from diesel cars, but also for CO2, there is an increasing difference between \u2018official\u2019 emission measurements compared to real-world driving emissions, an area of concern. Road traffic noise, both within and outside urban areas, is still the most important source of environmental noise in the EU. Around 125 million people were potentially exposed to noise levels exceeding 55 dB Lden in 2012. A sharp fall in freight demand occurred in the years immediately following the economic crisis and, following a limited recovery, freight volumes have since remained largely stable. In 2013, total freight transport was 7.3% higher than in 2000. Passenger transport increased until 2008, but it has remained broadly stable following the economic recession. In 2013 the number of passenger-kilometres was 8.4% higher than in 2000. Between 2000 and 2013, the proportion of diesel in energy consumed by road transport increased substantially. Financial incentives by many European governments have encouraged the uptake of diesel engines. The number of electric vehicles has grown but is only a minimal proportion (0.07%) of total passenger car fleet numbers. Despite EU policies designed to encourage greater use of environmentally friendly transport modes, car transport remains the dominant mode of passenger transport. Air transport is the fastest growing mode of passenger transport. Modal shift is a central element in the EU\u2019s decarbonisation ambitions, as improvements in energy efficiency alone are often insufficient to reduce transport\u2019s environmental impacts. Achieving the aspired modal shift would require significant investments in infrastructure, complemented by other measures to promote more environmentally friendly transport models. Innovations such as intelligent transport systems, new business models and autonomous vehicles may increase the future efficiency of the transport system.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/technological-solutions-and-behavioural-change"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0251", "date": "2015-12-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Resource-efficient cities: vital step towards urban sustainability in Europe", "text": "Three quarters of Europeans and more than half of the world population live in cities. They are places where people come together, work, trade, produce, enjoy social interaction, study and innovate. Like living organisms, cities require considerable flows and stocks of resources (such as energy, fuel, metal, wood, water, food, materials for buildings and infrastructure and land). After \u2018use\u2019, the residues are then discharged to the environment, in the form of air emissions, liquid and solid effluent and waste materials. These \u2018outflows\u2019 often exert significant pressures on human health and natural environments located well beyond the surroundings of cities. Given their importance in our society and economy, increasing the resource efficiency of cities - producing greater economic value and wellbeing with less resource and less waste - would not only help alleviate the impacts on the environment and human health, but also support the transition towards a green, circular economy.\u00a0 The three EEA reports \u2018What is a resource-efficient city?\u2019, \u2018Resource-efficient cities: good practices\u2019 and \u2018Enabling resource-efficient cities\u2019 address the following issues: Why resource-efficient cities matter? What are the main challenges and what can be done? What solutions can be implemented on different scales (time and space) and across sectors? What are the main drivers making urban transformation possible? How can cities be governed to achieve the transition to resource-efficient urban areas? How can the society be involved in the decision making process? The reports conclude that an effective solution to urban sustainability requires an alignment of visions and strategies across governance structures, the implementation of which needs to be adapted to the characteristics of the city in question (e.g. geography, economy, climate, natural capital and social capital). Selected highlights from the reports Resource use per person in urban areas is actually lower than in sparsely populated areas. Higher population density, proximity to businesses, reduced transportation needs, all associated with well-designed compact cities, can boost urban sustainability.\u00a0\u00a0 To make cities more resource-efficient, different but inter-dependent components of the urban system, such as energy, housing, transport, waste management, public spaces, and green areas, need to be changed simultaneously. The way cities have grown has had an impact on how people live, work and move. This has led to an expansion of grey infrastructure systems (roads, metro, railways, buildings, etc.). Green infrastructure planning would reverse this trend.\u00a0 Governance and policy-making processes play a role in determining the ability to implement efficient integrated urban planning and to design a vision for the future. The main challenge is to avoid conflict between actions taken at different levels and by different actors. Adopting strategic frameworks that set out targets for the future can act as a driving force for change. Resource-efficient and sustainable cities are identified as a priority in a number of EU initiatives and policies measures, including the Europe 2020 Strategy and the 7th Environment Action Programme. The reports aim to enhance the knowledge base in this area and support policy development and decision making related to urban management at local, city and regional levels.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/resource-efficient-cities-vital-step"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0252", "date": "2015-12-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Phase-down of fluorinated gases essential to reduce effect on climate", "text": "The new report \u2018Fluorinated greenhouse gases 2014\u2019 shows the production, use, import, export and destruction of these substances in the European Union in 2014. F-gas emissions in the EU have grown by almost 60 % since 1990, and currently make up approximately 2.5 % of EU-28 overall greenhouse gas emissions (measured in 'CO2-equivalent' tonnes (CO2e) to be able to assess their effect on the climate). F-gases were originally introduced to replace chemicals that were found to be harming the ozone layer. They are used in many different products, including refrigerators and air conditioning units. New F-gas Regulation European laws were recently revised and a new F-gas Regulation has been in force since 1 January 2015. This regulation, which includes a new quota system for the main type of F-gases (HFCs), aims to reduce F-gas emissions by two thirds of 2010 levels by 2030. Under the new legislation companies are obliged to report certain activities involving F-gases. Key findings The overall 2014 trends, based on company reporting on fluorinated greenhouse gases, can be summarised as follows: EU production of fluorinated gases continued to decline for the fourth consecutive year since 2011. Production, measured in tonnes, experienced a year-on-year decline of 15 %, or 11 % in terms of CO2e; Bulk imports of fluorinated gases\u00a0increased by 90 % compared to last year\u2019s reporting (CO2e); The high increase in bulk imports is mostly due to a 95 % increase in HFC imports, resulting to a large extent in HFC stockpiling in the EU; 2014 was marked by a 61 % increase in amounts of HFC being placed on the market. This is most probably due to stockpiling in anticipation of the HFC-phase down and quota allocations for placing HFCs on the market from 2015 onwards; Bulk exports of HFCs continued to increase for the fifth year in a row. There was an increase of 22 % (tonnes), or 24% (CO2e) compared to 2013.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/phase-down-of-fluorinated-gases"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0253", "date": "2015-12-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Waste prevention: where do European countries stand?", "text": "Although the overall amounts of waste generated in Europe declined between 2004 and 2012 by more than 1\u00a0% in absolute terms and more than 3% per person, 2.5\u00a0billion\u00a0tonnes of waste \u2014close to 5\u00a0tonnes per person\u2014 were discarded in the European Union in 2012. Reducing this waste can result in a wide range of environmental, economic and social benefits, such as reducing pollution in water and soil, greenhouse gas emissions and loss of valuable materials. The overarching principle behind EU and national waste policies is the \u2018waste hierarchy\u2019. Waste prevention has the highest priority in the hierarchy followed by (preparing for) reuse, recycling, other recovery and disposal as the least desirable option. To this end, The EU Waste Framework Directive set the obligation for Member States to adopt waste prevention programmes by the end of 2013. The EEA reviews annually the progress towards the \u2018completion and implementation of the programmes\u2019. The 7th Environment Action Programme also calls for a reduction of waste generated in absolute terms and per person. The EEA report \u2018Waste prevention in Europe \u2014 the status in 2014\u2019 is the second in this series of annual reviews of waste prevention programmes in Europe. The review process covers 36 programmes in the 28 EU Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The EEA report shows that waste prevention programmes show great variety in details, coverage, objectives, time horizons, targets, indicators, monitoring systems, measures and policy instruments. The report also includes examples of good practice from each country and region. Selected highlights The programmes cover a range of sectors and waste types. All of them cover sectors such as households and all except one the public services, whereas only a few programmes include the agriculture, and mining and raw materials sectors. The majority of the programmes address food/organic waste, municipal/household waste, waste electrical and electronic equipment, packaging waste and hazardous waste. Most programmes mention the overall objective of breaking the link between economic growth and the environmental impact associated with the generation of waste. \u00a0Improving material efficiency, resource efficiency, decoupling of resource use from economic growth and preventing the use of primary materials are listed in several programmes. The reduction of harmful substances is included in more than half of the programmes. Seventeen include quantitative targets ranging from total waste generated to more specific targets for particular sectors or waste types with different baseline and target years. Twenty-four programmes specify indicators for tracking progress on objectives and targets and, ultimately, on the effectiveness of waste prevention policies. Only ten programmes include explicitly monitoring systems. In some cases, monitoring is covered in other documents. The analysis highlights a broad range of planned measures: 39% focus on the design, production and distribution phase; 40% are related to the consumption and use phase; and 21% focus on the general framework conditions of waste generation. Of the policy instruments included in the programmes, 63% concern information and awareness raising; economic and regulatory instruments account for 16% and 14%, respectively; and 7% voluntary agreements. The actual effectiveness of the waste prevention programmes cannot yet be assessed. Future waste prevention reviews will include information on implementation and will also attempt to link actual waste generation with key socio-economic drivers, waste prevention objectives and targets. Future reviews may also focus on specific areas, providing more detailed analyses of selected waste types To consolidate the overarching framework for waste policy and resource efficiency policies, the European Commission has adopted the Circular economy package on 2 December 2015. The package sets out a number of measures across product design, production and consumption that can be expected to contribute to the prevention of waste. In addition, it puts specific obligations on EU Member States to reduce food waste and to introduce monitoring of waste prevention programmes.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/waste-prevention-where-do-european"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0254", "date": "2015-12-02", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Climate change adaptation in Europe: tracking progress and sharing know-how", "text": "Climate change impacts vary across Europe. Some regions are projected to face increasing water stress and drought, while others will experience floods. Different policies and actions therefore need to be put in place to meet adaptation needs and potential impacts specific to each area. To evaluate whether actions are effective and efficient, European countries need to collect and analyse information on adaptation policies in their territories. This knowledge allows for a better understanding of how and why certain actions work in certain contexts, which in turn supports the development of adaptation policies and measures. The European Environment Agency (EEA) report \u2018National monitoring, reporting and evaluation of climate change adaptation in Europe\u2019 consolidates emerging information on MRE systems at national level in European countries. It looks at the most recent activities from European countries, provides insights into key aspects (e.g. drivers, governance, methodology and information channels) and reflects on current practices as well as on future issues that might be relevant for those working in this area. The report includes national-level case studies. Tracking and evaluating adaptation actions The European Union \u2018Strategy on adaptation to climate change\u2019 foresees that the European Union and countries monitor and evaluate the status and progress of adaptation. In this context, the EEA report finds that an increasing number of European countries have already taken action on MRE systems. As of October 2015, 14 countries had MRE systems in place or under development: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Most European countries with MRE systems in place aim to monitor and report on the progress that has been achieved in the implementation of actions and policies included in national adaptation strategies or plans. Some also refer to monitoring the effectiveness of the actions and policy implementation. MRE of adaptation remains an emerging and dynamic field of practice where the experience of countries with more advanced MRE systems can be invaluable for those countries just beginning to consider building such systems. Experience in monitoring, reporting and evaluation in other new policy areas can also be relevant to the climate change adaptation policy domain since the challenges faced can be similar, for example in terms of data and information reporting availability and requirements. The report complements the information available on the European Climate Adaptation Platform Climate-ADAPT and national websites on climate change adaptation.

Similarly, the average emissions from vans sold in 2014 were 169.1 g CO2/km, below the 2017 limit of 175 g CO2/km. \u00a0Compliance with the EU fleet average targets is verified against the specific emissions targets set for each car and van manufacturer. The report shows that almost all manufacturers achieved their individual emissions targets set for 2014.\u00a0 Key findings In 2014, 12.5 million new passenger cars and 1.5 million vans were sold. Of these, diesel vehicles remained the most sold vehicles in Europe, constituting 53% of car sales and 97% of van sales. In 2014, an average diesel car emitted 123.2 g CO2/km, just 2.5 g CO2/km less than an average petrol car. Renault, Automobiles Peugeot, Automobiles Citroen and Toyota Motor Europe continue to produce most of the lowest-emitting cars. Of the individual car manufacturers, Renault had the lowest average CO2 emissions (108\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km) for new passenger vehicles registered in 2014. Renault also had the highest percentage of vehicles with emissions below 95 g\u00a0CO2/km (34%). Seventy percent of Toyota passenger vehicle sales in Europe were petrol cars with very low average emissions (110 g\u00a0CO2/km). Nissan has made the greatest improvement between 2013 and 2014. The average emissions from their passenger vehicles have decreased by almost 16 g\u00a0CO2/km. This good performance relates to an increased number of electric vehicles in the share of new cars sold, as well as sales of smaller vehicles and the improved performance of conventional vehicles. Of the larger van manufacturers, the Dacia fleet had the lowest average emissions (132 g\u00a0CO2/km), followed by Peugeot (147 g\u00a0CO2/km), Citroen (148 g\u00a0CO2/km) and Renault (149 g\u00a0CO2/km). Background EEA activities In accordance with current EU regulations ((EC) No 443/2009 for passenger cars and (EU) No 510/2011 for vans), the EEA collects\u00a0data on all new vehicles registered in Europe\u00a0and makes it available online. The data collected includes information on various parameters, including CO2\u00a0emissions and vehicle mass. Data is reported by all Member States in order to evaluate the performance of the new vehicle fleet towards the respective CO2\u00a0emissions targets. Air pollutant emissions, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), are not addressed in this report.\u00a0 Future developments in vehicle emission measurements The CO2 emissions reported to the EEA are based on exhaust measurements performed under standardised laboratory conditions, following the requirements of the New European Driving Cycle test procedure. This cycle allows a comparison of emissions by manufacturers, but it does not necessarily represent real-world driving conditions. A new procedure known as the \u2018Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure\u2019 (WLTP) has been developed so that laboratory results may in the future better represent actual vehicle performance on the road. However, the introduction date of this new procedure in the EU is not yet agreed. Caveat Since finalisation of the EEA report and underpinning datasets, Volkswagen Group has publicly confirmed that the CO2 emission values it has published for some models are incorrectly stated. The company is presently reviewing which models are specifically affected. This report documents the latest official data submitted by Member States and vehicle manufacturers. However it is not possible to assess at this stage\u00a0the extent to which incorrect data from vehicle manufacturers may alter the analysis and conclusions.

EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx The EEA report 'Air quality in Europe \u2014 2015 report' examines the European population\u2019s exposure to air pollutants and provides a snapshot of air quality based on data from official monitoring stations across Europe. It shows that most city dwellers continue to be exposed to air pollutants at levels deemed unsafe by the World Health Organization (WHO). The most problematic pollutants affecting human health are particulate matter (PM), ground-level ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Health impact estimates associated with long-term exposure to PM2.5 show that this pollutant was responsible for 432 000 premature deaths in Europe in 2012, a level similar to that estimated in previous years. The estimated impacts of NO2 and O3 exposure were around 75\u00a0000 and 17\u00a0000 premature deaths respectively. The report also provides estimates of premature deaths at country level. \u2018Despite continuous improvements in recent decades, air pollution is still affecting the general health of Europeans, reducing their quality of life and life expectancy,\u2019 said EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx. \u2018It also has considerable economic impacts, increasing medical costs and reducing productivity through working days lost across the economy.\u2019 Alongside health, air pollutants also have a significant harmful impact on plant life and ecosystems. These problems, including eutrophication caused by ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), as well as damage caused by O3 to plants, are still widespread across Europe.\u00a0 Other key findings Particulate matter can cause or aggravate cardiovascular and lung diseases, heart attacks and arrhythmias. It can also cause cancer. In 2013, 87% of the urban population in the EU were exposed to PM2.5 concentrations that exceeded the WHO value set to protect human health. The air quality standard in the EU is less strict and only 9% were exposed to PM2.5 above the EU target value. The benefits of improving Europe\u2019s air quality are clear \u2013 meeting the WHO air quality standard throughout the EU\u201128 would lead to average PM2.5 concentrations dropping by about one-third, resulting in 144 000 fewer premature deaths compared with the current situation. PM2.5\u00a0refers to particles with a diameter of 2.5 \u03bcm or less. Small particles can penetrate deeply into the lungs. Ozone exposure in cities remains very high \u2013 98% of the EU-28 urban population were exposed to O3 concentrations above the WHO guideline value in 2013. Some 15% were exposed to concentrations above the (less strict) EU target value for O3. Ozone concentrations also damage agricultural crops, forests and plants by reducing their growth rates and yields. The long-term objective for the protection of vegetation from O3 was exceeded in 86% of the total EU-28 agricultural area. Nitrogen dioxide affects the respiratory system directly, but also contributes to the formation of PM and O3. In 2013, 9% of the urban population in the EU-28 were exposed to NO2 concentrations above the WHO and identical EU standards, with 93% of all exceedances occurring close to roads. Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is an organic pollutant that is carcinogenic. Typically formed as a result of wood burning, exposure to BaP pollution is widespread, in particular in central and eastern Europe. A quarter of the EU-28 urban population were exposed to BaP concentrations above the target value in 2013, and as much as 91% were exposed to BaP concentrations above the estimated reference level based on WHO risk figures. Sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions have been reduced significantly over past decades as a result of EU legislation requiring the use of emissions scrubbing technology and lower sulphur content in fuels. There were only a few exceedances of the SO2 EU limit value in 2013. Carbon monoxide, benzene and heavy metal (arsenic, cadmium, nickel and lead) concentrations in outdoor air were generally low in the EU in 2013, with few exceedances of the respective limit and target values set by EU legislation.\u00a0 Links\u00a0 EEA indicator on exceedance of air quality limit values in urban areas EEA indicator on exposure of ecosystems to acidification, eutrophication and ozone EEA infographic and video on health impacts of air pollution European Commission information on proposed measures to improve Europe\u2019s air quality", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/many-europeans-still-exposed-to-air-pollution-2015"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0257", "date": "2015-10-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Picture2050: and the winners are\u2026", "text": "Picture2050 invited Europeans to depict a personal or a generic story, consisting of three photographs, depicting their vision, interpretation or understanding of \u2018living well, within the limits of our planet in 2050\u2019 along the three key topics of the European Union\u2019s Seventh Environment Action Programme: natural capital; resource-efficient, low-carbon economy; and human health and well-being.

Our report shows that the EU is on track towards its 2020 climate targets. The report also shows that to achieve our longer-term goals for 2030 and 2050, a fundamental change is needed in the way we produce and use energy in Europe.\" On track towards 2020 greenhouse gas target The EEA report reveals that according to approximated (\u2018proxy\u2019) estimates for 2014 greenhouse gas, emissions fell by 4% in 2014 compared to 2013. This was partly due to an unusually warm year, which lowered energy demand. This means the EU\u2019s domestic greenhouse gas emissions were 23% below 1990 levels in 2014. Latest projections by Member States[1] show the EU is heading for a 24% reduction by 2020 with current measures in place, and a 25% reduction with additional measures already being planned in Member States. The EU is therefore also on track towards its Kyoto Protocol target for the second commitment period from 2013 to 2020. Progress towards 2030 greenhouse gas target Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are projected to continue beyond 2020 but at a slower pace. According to projections submitted by Member States, planned reductions are estimated to bring emissions between 27% (with current measures) and 30% (with additional measures already being planned by Member States) below 1990 levels by 2030. New policies will therefore need to be put in place to meet the 40% reduction target by 2030.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) is an agency of the European Union. It aims to support sustainable development and to help achieve significant and measurable improvement in Europe's environment by providing timely, targeted, relevant and reliable information to policymaking agents and the public. It is supported in its work by the European environment information and observation network (Eionet), a network of 39 European countries.

They are home to a diverse range of habitats, sustaining thousands of species of plants and animals. This biodiversity is the foundation for marine ecosystems and their capacity to provide us services, such as climate regulation, sea food, or leisure activities like diving and whale watching. However, human activities at sea as well as on land are impacting Europe\u2019s seas and putting pressure on marine species: damage and loss of habitats, extraction of resources, introduction of non-indigenous species, pollution and the effects of climatic change. The cumulative effect of these pressures is damaging the state of marine ecosystems. To safeguard biodiversity in areas vital for the health of the seas and to address increasingly complex threats to marine ecosystems, EU Member States have designated networks of marine protected areas. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are in general defined as geographically distinct zones for which conservation objectives can be set and the management of which should be based on an ecosystem-based approach. They are often established to strike a balance between ecological constraints and economic activity. MPA networks are a collection of individual MPAs operating cooperatively and are designed to meet objectives that cannot be achieved by individual MPAs alone. An MPA network needs to be, among others, representative, i.e. protecting the range of biodiversity found in the seas. How much progress has the EU made in designating marine protected areas? Can we assess if marine protected areas work? Are Europe\u2019s MPA networks ecologically coherent and well-managed? The EEA report \u2018Marine protected areas in Europe\u2019s seas \u2014 an overview and perspectives for the future\u2019 addresses these questions by providing an overview of MPAs in Europe\u00b4s seas and the relevant EU policy framework. The report aims to support the European Commission\u2019s progress report on MPAs. \u00a0 According to the report, Europe needs to implement a more holistic approach to MPA design, management and evaluation. With a better implementation of existing legislation across Europe\u2019s seas, as well as more effective management, MPA networks could play a crucial role in reversing systemic changes observed in Europe\u2019s seas. They can help halt biodiversity loss, achieve clean, healthy and biologically diverse seas, and secure sustainability. Key messages Europe has extensive international, European and national policy frameworks to support the creation of MPAs. By the end of 2012, EU Member States had designated 5.9% of their seas as MPAs. EU MPA networks cannot yet be considered representative or ecologically coherent. The Natura 2000 network\u00a0is the cornerstone of MPAs in Europe. Although the network at sea is not yet complete, it is considered a success. It targets a number of vulnerable marine species and habitats. It spans the marine territory of 23 countries and covers more than 4% of Europe\u2019s seas. The Natura 2000 network could benefit further from a full implementation of the EU\u2019s Birds and Habitats Directives. In its current form, Natura 2000 is not set up to deliver an ecologically coherent and representative network in marine areas. The four Regional Seas Conventions (covering the Baltic Sea; the North-east Atlantic Ocean; the Mediterranean Sea; and the Black Sea) are good platforms for developing and implementing an ecosystem based approach to the designation and management of MPAs. Some EU Member States have designated additional MPAs under national legislation to better ensure representativity and ecological coherence. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of EU MPA networks, information sources need to be better harmonised, science-based evaluation criteria need to be developed, and operational objectives need to be formulated. Background on Europe\u2019s seas The EEA has recently published a comprehensive study on Europe\u2019s seas. The \u2018State of Europe\u2019s seas\u2019 report examines whether the EU is meeting its policy goals for the quality of the marine environment. The report shows that, despite some improvements, the way we use our seas remains unsustainable and threatens not only the productivity of our seas, but also our wellbeing. Human activities and climate change are increasingly putting a number of pressures on Europe\u2019s seas, the cumulative effects of which threaten the functioning and resilience of marine ecosystems. The EEA will also publish a technical report further documenting the methodology and data used for the spatial analysis of EU marine protected areas later in 2015.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/protecting-marine-life-in-europe2019s-seas-1"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0260", "date": "2015-09-24", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Forests can help prevent floods and droughts", "text": "One third of European territory is covered by forests (mostly managed) and approximately 296 million Europeans live in or close to forests. Forests are essential for human well-being and provide a wide range of ecosystem services to society, including \u2018water retention\u2019, defined as the water absorbed or used by forests. The EEA report \u2018Water-retention potential of Europe's forests\u2019\u00a0shows that water retention has an important role to play in buffering the effects of heavy rainfall and droughts. A better understanding of this role can help develop measures to tackle the effects of climate change and extreme weather events. The volume of water retained by forests can depend on characteristics such as forest cover area, the length of vegetation growing season, tree composition and tree density, as well as the age and the number of layers of vegetation cover. Water retention by forests affects the amount and timing of the water delivered to streams and groundwater by increasing and maintaining infiltration and storage capacity of the soil. Forests can soak up excess rainwater, preventing run-offs and damage from flooding. By releasing water in the dry season, forests can also help provide clean water and mitigate the effects of droughts. The report shows that water retention potential tends to increase along with the extent of forest cover in a water basin. Compared to basins with a forest cover of 10%, total water retention is 25% and 50% higher in water basins where the forest cover is more than 30% and 70%, respectively. Irrespective of the extent of the basin\u2019s forest cover, water retention is typically about 25% greater in summer time than in winter time and that coniferous forests in general retain 10% more water than broadleaved forests or mixed forests. In general, forests in Alpine and Continental regions have the highest water-retention potentials, while Atlantic and Mediterranean regions register lower water-retention potentials. The report suggests that despite its important role, water retention by forests cannot be promoted as a one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, water retention should be considered on a case-by-case basis according to local and regional ecological and hydrological conditions, as proposed in the natural water-retention measures catalogue of the European Commission\u00a0.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/forests-can-help-prevent-floods"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0261", "date": "2015-09-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Can nature help reduce the impacts of climate change?", "text": "Weather- and climate-related hazards, including extreme precipitation, floods, wet mass movement (e.g. avalanches and landslides) and storm surges are among the costliest and deadliest natural hazards in Europe and globally. The EEA\u2019s new report \u2018Exploring nature-based solutions: the role of green infrastructure in mitigating the impacts of weather- and climate change-related natural hazards\u2019 focuses on certain types of extreme events and hazards in Europe that are likely to be amplified by ongoing climate change. As mentioned in the Green Infrastructure Strategy, the European Commission defines green infrastructure as a strategically planned network of high-quality green spaces. In this study, green infrastructure is defined by its capacity to provide a relevant number of ecosystem services. The maps presented in this study provide an overview of where specific weather- and climate-related natural hazards are likely to occur, where well-functioning ecosystem services exist which can support disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation so as to lessen the impacts of natural hazards (e.g. floods and landslides), and where the provision of ecosystem services may be improved. Green infrastructure solutions that boost disaster resilience are also an integral part of EU policy on disaster risk management. Climate change and infrastructure development make disaster-prone areas more vulnerable to extreme weather events and natural disasters such as floods, landslides, avalanches, forest fires, storms and wave surges that cause loss of life and result in billions of euros of damage and insurance costs each year in the EU. The impacts of such events on human society and the environment can often be reduced using green infrastructure solutions. To address some of these challenges, the report proposes a simple, practical methodology for screening (rather than assessing) ecosystem services in areas where green infrastructure may contribute to reducing current (or future) weather- and climate-related natural hazards.

Within the EU, ozone depleting substances (ODS) are covered by the ODS Regulation, which is more stringent than the rules of the Protocol and covers additional substances. Companies are obliged to report their use of ODS, including imports, exports, production and destruction. The EU has implemented the phase-out of ODS use in line with the Montreal Protocol requirements over the period 1987-2010, which is 10 years ahead of the legal provision. The key metric under the Protocol to measure the use is \u2018consumption\u2019. It is calculated from the reported data on production, import, export and destruction. The EEA report 'Ozone depleting substances 2014' shows that consumption in the EU was negative in 2014, as was the general trend over the last years.\u00a0 These negative values are the result of a phase-out in combination with rather high destruction and low stocks. Since the potential to harm the ozone layer varies among substances, the data collected on these chemicals are expressed not only in metric tonnes but also in 'ozone depleting potential' (ODP) tonnes which show quantities in terms of their environmental effects rather than physical weight. The report is published to coincide with the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer. Ozone depleting substances and climate change Many ODS are also potent greenhouse gases. Their phase out has therefore had a significant positive impact on climate change prevention. However, some of the ODS substitutes can equally contribute to climate change.

For the first time, this year\u2019s report also documents black carbon (BC) emissions, an air pollutant which is also an important short lived climate forcer. Across the EU-28, sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions have fallen the most since 1990 (87% reduction), followed by carbon monoxide (CO) (66%), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) (59%) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) (54%). NH3 emissions have declined less since 1990 than emissions of the other main pollutants (27%). The rate at which emissions are decreasing for these pollutants has, however, slowed over the last decade. The\u00a0Gothenburg Protocol\u00a0to the UNECE LRTAP Convention contains emissions reduction commitments that have to be met from 2010 onwards for the pollutants NOx, NMVOCs, SOx and NH3. In addition to emissions reduction commitments specified for individual countries, the protocol also specifies reduction commitments for the EU-15. Further key findings Emissions of primary PM10 and PM2.5 particulate matter both declined by around 20% between 2000 and 2013. For the 19 Member States that reported BC emissions for the first time, two thirds reported decreased emissions since 1990. Emissions of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg), dioxins and furans, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have also dropped substantially since 1990, in the order of 70% or more. The EU-15 met its limits for emissions of the four pollutants addressed under the Gothenburg Protocol. However, eight EU Member States exceeded one of their international emissions ceilings in 2013, while Austria (NOx and NH3), Ireland (NOx and NMVOCs) and Germany (NMVOCs and NH3) exceeded two ceilings. Five Member States (Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland and Luxembourg) reported NOx emissions higher than their Gothenburg ceilings while six Member States (Austria, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Croatia) exceeded their NH3 ceiling. Three Member States (Denmark, Germany and Ireland) exceeded their NMVOCs ceilings. The EEA member countries Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, also have emissions ceilings specified under the Gothenburg Protocol. In 2013, Liechtenstein exceeded two ceilings (NOx and NH3) and Norway one ceiling (NH3). This year, Switzerland complied with all its ceilings. Background information Apart from the emissions of NOx, NMVOCs, SOx and NH3, parties to the LRTAP Convention are required to report data for numerous other air pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM) and black carbon (BC), and selected heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The main air pollutants and their effect on human health and the environment are summarised in the EEA\u2019s Air Quality 2014 report.

Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The European Environment Agency (EEA) publishes Signals annually, providing a snapshot of issues of interest to the environmental debate and the wider public. Signals 2015 - Living in a changing climate focuses on climate change. Science shows that we need to reduce global greenhouse-gas emissions substantially in order to avoid the most adverse impacts of climate change. It is also clear that we need to adapt to our changing climate. Even with substantial reductions in our greenhouse-gas emissions, our climate is expected to change to some degree and the impacts of this will be felt across the world, including in Europe. Floods and droughts are expected to become more frequent and intense. \u00a0\u2018The severity of climate change will depend on how much and how quickly we can cut greenhouse-gas emissions released into the atmosphere.

The scientific community strongly recommends limiting the rise in global average temperatures and reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to avoid adverse impacts of climate change,\u2019 says Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. Recent research estimates that without adaptation actions heat-related deaths could reach about 200 000 per year in Europe by 2100. The cost of river flood damages could be more than EUR 10 billion a year. Faced with current and future impacts, Europeans need both to mitigate and to adapt to climate change. Measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change are often considered to be expensive, and are seen as an additional burden on the economy. But European countries are already spending public and private funds on research, infrastructure, agriculture, energy, transport, urban development, social protection, health, and nature conservation. Re-directing our existing expenditure towards climate-friendly and sustainable options can not only help us mitigate and adapt to climate change, but also help create new jobs.

This requires aligning our policy ambitions for economic growth with our policy targets of securing healthy, clean and productive seas. Ultimately, this will entail making fundamental changes in the way we meet our societal needs. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director In line with the development of the European Union\u2019s (EU) Blue Growth objectives, which aspire to greater and sustainable use of the seas\u2019 potential, the EEA\u2019s new \u2018State of Europe\u2019s seas\u2019 report examines whether the EU is meeting its policy goals for the quality of the marine environment. From fisheries to offshore energy production, and protection of marine biodiversity, the EU has a range of policies related to planning and regulating the sustainable use of Europe\u2019s seas. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive, adopted in 2008, aims to ensure coherence between such EU policies and sets three goals for Europe\u2019s seas: to be \u2018productive\u2019, \u2018healthy\u2019, and \u2018clean\u2019. Based on the data available, the EEA finds that although Europe\u2019s seas can be considered productive, they cannot be considered healthy or clean. The report also looks into describing what ecosystem-based management could mean in the marine context and how to improve our knowledge, as well as considering future challenges in relation to the long-term sustainability of Europe\u2019s seas. Pressures on the rise Seas are home to a wide variety of marine life and contain ecosystems essential for life on our planet. They are also an important source of food, raw material, medicine, energy, and are used as global highways for trade. Only a very limited number of assessments of marine habitats and species indicate favourable conservation status. Current pressures include, among others, physical damage to the seafloor (due to bottom-trawling in particular), introduction of non-indigenous species, nutrient input (mainly from agricultural fertilisers), hazardous substance pollution and marine litter. Climate change induced temperature increases and potential ocean acidification can further weaken the ecological resilience of Europe\u2019s Seas. A large part of the pressures arises from activities at sea, such as the extraction and production of living resources (fish, shellfish, etc.), transport and energy production, or pollution such as marine litter. Land-based activities \u2014 such as the use of agricultural fertilisers and industrial chemicals, and wastewater \u2014 also add to the pressures. Human activities are reaching levels that threaten the productivity and resilience of our seas, and our wellbeing. Degrading the oceans\u2019 life-support function could actually mean crossing a critical planetary boundary. \u2018We need to respect the ecological boundaries of Europe\u2019s seas if we want to continue enjoying the benefits we receive. This requires aligning our policy ambitions for economic growth with our policy targets of securing healthy, clean and productive seas. Ultimately, this will entail making fundamental changes in the way we meet our societal needs\u2019, said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. \u2018Seas are part of our European natural capital and their protection and exploitation require a European approach. In many cases, it also requires a global approach. Our report contributes to the knowledge base needed for relevant policy discussions, currently ongoing at European and global levels,\u2019 added Bruyninckx. Selection of facts from the report For species and habitats assessed from 2007 to 2012 under the EU\u2019s Habitats Directive, 9% of marine habitats and 7% of marine species assessments were in \u2018favourable conservation status\u2019, while 66% of habitat and 27% of species assessments were \u2018unfavourable\u2019. Over 650 marine fish species, over 180 marine bird species, five species of sea turtles and almost 40% of the world\u2019s known marine mammals are found in Europe\u2019s seas. Around 320 new non-indigenous species have been observed in Europe\u2019s seas since 2000. The knowledge base on marine biodiversity remains very limited, calling for greater cooperation among EU countries and with other countries bordering the regional seas of Europe. Climate change is already affecting Europe\u2019s marine ecosystems. Hazardous substances are widespread in the marine environment. They can accumulate through the marine food chain and pose health risks to humans. Marine litter, mainly in the form of plastic, is also accumulating in Europe\u2019s seas. Most of the litter comes from land-based activities. Micro-plastics can enter the food web. Underwater noise from human activities (shipping, renewable energy, oil and gas extraction, etc.) is increasing and can have a wide range of impacts on marine life. Signs of improvement are observed in certain pressures, such as fishing and nutrient loading. More than half of the commercial fish stocks assessed are not in good environmental status. Total catches in all fishing regions have been declining in the past ten years. The EU is increasingly dependent on imports of its most widely consumed species: tuna, cod and salmon. The maritime sector is estimated to provide 6.1 million jobs and to generate an economic value of approximately EUR 467 billion.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/europe2019s-seas-productive-but-not"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0267", "date": "2015-06-11", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Many European countries' air pollutant emissions above legal limits", "text": "Under the National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive, EU Member States have individual air pollutant emission limits, or 'ceilings', for sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC). As of 2010, Member States should not have exceeded their emission ceilings, but the EEA report 'NEC Directive status report 2014', which includes preliminary data for 2013 and summarises data for 2010-12, confirms that a number of countries did so for these years. The four pollutants addressed in the directive harm human health and the environment, causing respiratory illnesses, acidifying soil and surface waters, and damaging vegetation. Key findings Ten Member States exceeded at least one ceiling in 2013. Germany was the only country that exceeded three of the four emission ceilings (NOx, NMVOCs and NH3), while Austria (NOx and NH3), Denmark (NMVOCs and NH3) and Ireland (NOx and NMVOCs) exceeded two ceilings in 2013. The following six Member States - Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland and Luxembourg - exceeded their NOx emission ceilings in all years from 2010-2013. In 2013, Germany and France reported the highest exceedances of NOx limits with 218\u00a0kilotonnes and 180\u00a0kilotonnes, respectively. In percentage terms, Luxembourg (41%) and Austria (32%) exceeded their NOx emission ceilings by the greatest amount in 2013. Emissions from road transport is one of the main reasons for the large number of NOx exceedances. NOx reductions from the road transport sector have been lower than originally anticipated over the last two decades, partly because transport has grown more than expected, and partly owing to the increased number of diesel vehicles producing higher NOx emissions than petrol-fuelled vehicles.\u00a0It is also an issue that \u2018real-world emissions\u2019 often exceed the permitted test-cycle emissions used for certification of vehicles complying with Euro standards. This is particularly true for light-duty diesel vehicles. Six Member States also have persistent problems meeting their national emission limits for NH3. Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands and Spain all breached the ceilings for four years running (2010-13). Almost 95% of NH3 emissions stem from agriculture, mainly from the use of fertilisers and the handling of animal manure. NH3 emissions have decreased since 1990, but not to the same extent as the other pollutants covered by the NEC Directive. The ceilings for sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions were not exceeded by any Member State between 2010 and 2013.

However, climate impacts vary across Europe. More than three quarters of Europeans live in cities. Urban residents, city authorities, national and EU institutions need information about how cities will be affected and how to plan accordingly. The EEA has brought all the relevant data available for cities across Europe together in an interactive \u2018urban vulnerability map book\u2019 on the European Climate Adaptation portal Climate-ADAPT. The maps are clustered around four climate threats (heatwaves, drought and water scarcity, flooding and forest fires) and cities\u2019 capacity to respond. The map book shows how different factors, such as the amount of green urban areas, the share of elderly people or levels of trust and financial resources, interact at city level and determine the vulnerability of the cities included. Explore cities\u2019 vulnerability For example, the map of thermal comfort shows the effect of the urban heat island. Cities in northern and western Europe can expect more heatwave days in the future. For example, a specific regional analysis for cities in the Randstad area (Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague) in the Netherlands indicates that even in cities currently experiencing hardly any warm nights, heat stress at night can be felt more than a month per year. Green urban areas help cool cities. In addition to their overall share in the urban surface area, their distribution in the city and the presence or lack of a green hinterland also play a role. For example, Badajoz in Spain and Sassari in Italy have a relatively high share of green urban areas but these areas are clustered in a few places in the city. Nevertheless, they benefit from a green hinterland. In contrast, Porto in Portugal has a low share of green urban areas but they are evenly distributed across the city allowing easy access to cooler open space. Demographics can also affect cities\u2019 vulnerability to climate impacts. In general, the elderly are more sensitive to health risks posed by heat waves. For example, cities in northern Italy have shares of elderly people higher than the country average, suggesting that high temperatures might require specific attention in the area. The map book provides a first indication of cities\u2019 vulnerability and can be supplemented with more detailed local data.

The European Environment Agency's recent assessments, including The European environment \u2013 state and outlook 2015 and State of Nature in the EU, show that Europe's biodiversity is still being eroded, despite significant local improvements. To halt the loss of biodiversity, stabilise and restore degraded ecosystems, the European Union has adopted the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, which sets various targets and actions. An effective implementation of the strategy depends, among others, on the data and information available on biodiversity in Europe. Through its extensive network and close collaboration with partners, the EEA contributes extensively to the knowledge base on Europe's biodiversity. How to map and assess ecosystems As part of its contributions to this knowledge base, the EEA published today its new technical report 'European ecosystem assessment \u2013 concept, data, and implementation'. The report aims at supporting the implementation of EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, more concretely to Target 2 Action 5 \u2013 Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES). It describes, among others, the conceptual framework to map and assess ecosystems in detail as well as the mapping and assessment process. By outlining a coherent framework, the report aims to support Member States and Commission services tasked to carry out ecosystem assessments and making use of the outcomes. There are different strands of information and data, which can be used in mapping and assessing ecosystems in Europe. The report uses the DPSIR (Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact, Response) approach to put all the relevant information available in a coherent context. The Millennium Assessment identified five major groups of pressures: habitat change, climate change, invasive species, land use management, and pollution and nutrient enrichment. The report builds on these five groups and provides how different ecosystem types (e.g. cropland, forests, freshwater) are affected by each pressure group. The report includes a series of maps of Europe, showing different types of ecosystem-based assessments that can be carried out with the available knowledge.

The world has been celebrating the International Day for Biological Diversity to raise awareness and understanding of the issues around biodiversity since 1993.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/cherishing-nature-world-biodiversity-day"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0272", "date": "2015-05-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "State of nature in the EU: biodiversity still being eroded, but some local improvements observed", "text": "The results are mixed but clear. When implemented well, conservation measures work and improve the status of habitats and species on the ground. Such improvements remain limited and patchy, and unfortunately Europe\u2019s biodiversity is still being eroded overall and the pressures continue.\u00a0 Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The two nature directives, namely the Birds and Habitats directives, play a central role in the EU\u2019s biodiversity and nature conservation policies. Under the directives, EU Member States are required to assess and report every six years on the status and trends of certain species and habitats. The EEA technical report State of Nature in the EU: Results from reporting under the nature directives 2007-2012\u00a0draws on the assessments submitted by Member States under both directives and provides a comprehensive overview of the state of nature in Europe at European, country and biogeographic level. The report also looks into main pressures and threats behind the trends observed. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said, \u2018This unique assessment is a first of its kind, building on extensive observation networks of experts and citizens alike. Despite some information gaps, it provides the most complete picture of Europe\u2019s biodiversity to date.\u2019 Bruyninckx added, \u2018The results are mixed but clear. When implemented well, conservation measures work and improve the status of habitats and species on the ground. Such improvements remain limited and patchy, and unfortunately Europe\u2019s biodiversity is still being eroded overall and the pressures continue. We also need to understand that when dealing with maintaining and enhancing biodiversity, it takes time for our actions to make a difference on a large scale. Therefore, we need to reinforce our effort and actions.\u2019 Moreover, the EEA\u2019s report informs on progress towards Targets 1 and 3 of the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy. These findings will serve as an input to the European Commission\u2019s upcoming Mid-Term Review of the EU Biodiversity Strategy. Key findings: Over half of the bird species in the EU are considered to be \u2018secure\u2019, i.e. with no foreseeable risk of extinction. Many bird species, for which the Birds Directive requires Member States to set up special protection areas (species listed in Annex I), have recorded increases in their populations, although often these species are not considered secure. Other bird species, including many that may be hunted (species listed in Annex II), show declining populations. Under the Habitats Directive, only 16% of habitats and 23% of species assessments are \u2018favourable\u2019, while 77% of habitats and 60% of species assessments are \u2018unfavourable\u2019. The status of many species, e.g. birds of prey and many large carnivores, has shown significant improvements in some areas, but these improvements are currently limited to local or regional level, and have not yet scaled up to European level. The Natura 2000 network (created by the Habitats Directive) covers 18% of the EU\u2019s land surface and 4% of its seas. Natura 2000 appears to be an effective conservation measure, which also benefits non-target species. In relation to Target 1 (halting the deterioration in the status of all species and habitats and achieving significant improvements) of the Biodiversity Strategy, only 21% of habitat and 28% of species assessments are favourable or improving. Moreover, a significant share of previously unfavourable assessments have deteriorated further (30% for habitats and 22% for species). In relation to Target 3 (increasing the contribution of agriculture and forestry to maintaining and enhancing biodiversity), species and habitats depending on agricultural ecosystems are doing worse than general assessments, while species and habitats depending on forest ecosystems have a similar and worrying conservation status to other species and habitats in general. Member States reported on pressures and threats for each habitat and species. Agricultural activities, artificialisation of rivers and lakes and water abstraction were the most frequently reported pressures that have high negative impacts on the state of nature. Complementary information and data on individual species and habitats, as well as country data and summaries can be found at EEA biodiversity data centre and\u00a0European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity\u00a0website. Background information The reporting under the Birds Directive covers all species of naturally occurring wild birds in Europe, while the reports under the Habitats Directive only cover a selection of habitats and species that are considered rare and/or endangered. Given this difference, the species reports under the Habitats Directive have a higher proportion of \u2018unfavourable\u2019 status than the reports under the Birds Directive. Under the Birds Directive, the bird population status can be \u2018secure\u2019, \u2018near threatened, declining or depleted\u2019, \u2018threatened\u2019 or \u2018unknown\u2019 where data is not sufficient to allow an assessment. Under the Habitats Directive, the conservation status can be \u2018favourable\u2019, \u2018unfavourable-inadequate\u2019, \u2018unfavourable-bad\u2019, or \u2018unknown\u2019. For \u2018unfavourable\u2019 assessments, the trend was also classified as \u2018unfavourable-improving\u2019, \u2018unfavourable-stable\u2019, \u2018unfavourable-declining\u2019 and \u2018unfavourable-unknown\u2019. Several hundreds of experts across the EU were involved in collecting, processing and reporting the data and the information, which formed the basis of the country reports and this EEA report. A large number of citizens also took part in monitoring many species. However, despite this extensive effort, there are still information gaps and Member States have to invest more in monitoring species and habitats.

This is significantly below the 2017 target of 175 g CO2/km, which was already reached in 2013, four years ahead of schedule. The data is published by the European Environment Agency (EEA), which started monitoring the emissions of light commercial vehicles in 2012. Final data will be published in the autumn after van manufacturers verify this preliminary data. Key findings:\u00a0 The EU market for vans grew by 18% in 2014. Registrations increased in all EU Member States compared to 2013, except for Malta and the Netherlands. More than 60% of the vehicles were registered in three countries: France (24%), United Kingdom (21%) and Germany (15%). Diesel vehicles make up the vast majority of van sales (97%). Alternative fuel vehicles using, for example, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) or natural gas (NG), represent less than 2% of the fleet, with electric vehicle sales comprising less than 0.5%. The average emission levels vary across Europe. Slightly more efficient models were bought in the pre-2004 EU Member States (169.0 g CO2/km) compared to the EU Member States that joined after 2004 (171.6 g CO2/km).\u00a0 Emissions levels were lowest among new vans sold in Portugal (145.1 g CO2/km), Malta (145.7 g CO2/km) and Bulgaria (148.6 g CO2/km). At the other end of the scale, emissions were approximately 30% higher for the average vans sold in Slovakia (193.3 gCO2/km), the Czech Republic (191.1 g CO2/km) and Germany (190.4 g CO2/km). \u00a0 The increasing fuel efficiency of vans observed in 2014 is similar to that recently reported by the EEA for new passenger cars sold, which improved by 2.6% between 2013 and 2014. Background\u00a0 Member States report CO2\u00a0emission levels based upon a certification test procedure. These levels are measured under laboratory conditions using the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) as specified in EU legislation. This certification procedure is designed to make the measurements for all vehicles comparable, but it does not necessarily represent real-world conditions.\u00a0 Many vehicles classified as vans under EU legislation are built in several stages involving in most cases a base vehicle (chassis and cab) built by the vehicle manufacturer and a second stage body builder that is responsible for adapting the vehicle for its final purpose. According to EU legislation, it is in most cases only the base vehicle that undergoes the CO2 emissions test. As a consequence, it is the base vehicle manufacturer that is legally responsible for the CO2 emissions of the final vehicle. The vans emissions data compiled by the EEA is therefore more complex than that of passenger cars. In 2014, a new data collection method has been applied with the aim of improving in particular the identification of multi-stage vehicles but also to ensure higher data quality and more simplified data verification. Changes made to this method also result in a higher level of detail in the dataset.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/new-vans-sold-in-europe"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0274", "date": "2015-05-12", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Europeans continue enjoying high-quality bathing waters", "text": "I am glad to see that the quality of Europe's bathing waters is consistently very high and continues to improve. It shows that policies work and contribute to our quality of life when they are ambitious, well-defined and well-implemented. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director All the bathing sites in Cyprus, Luxembourg, and Malta had excellent water quality. These countries were followed by Greece (97%), Croatia (94%) and Germany (90%), all having a high proportion of sites with excellent bathing water quality. Across Europe, just under 2% of bathing sites failed to meet the Bathing Water Directive\u2019s minimum standards for water quality and were rated \u2018poor\u2019. The results are from the annual bathing water quality report from the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Commission, which compares the quality of bathing water sampled at more than 21 000 coastal and inland bathing sites across the EU, Switzerland and Albania in 2014. Alongside the report, the EEA has published an interactive map showing the performance of each bathing site. Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, said: \"At some point we are all tourists, passing some time on the beach.\u00a0 It is obvious that clean and safe bathing waters are important for us to stay healthy and the good news is that bathing waters continue to improve.\u00a0 So next time you take a dip, remember that the EU played a part in keeping your bathing water safe and clean!\" Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \"I am glad to see that the quality of Europe's bathing waters is consistently very high and continues to improve.

Only 409 bathing sites, corresponding to less than 2% of the total number, were assessed as having poor bathing water quality. The highest numbers of bathing sites with poor water quality were found in Italy (107 bathing sites, 2%), France (105 bathing sites, 3%) and Spain (67 bathing sites, 3%). In general, coastal beaches score high, with almost 97% of EU sites meeting the minimum standards and more than 85% rated as \u2018excellent\u2019. All coastal beaches in Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus were classified as having excellent bathing water quality. In comparison, 91% of inland bathing waters (lakes and rivers) score at least minimum standards and more than 78% have excellent quality. In Luxembourg and Bulgaria, all inland bathing sites were rated excellent followed by Denmark where 95% of bathing water lakes had excellent quality. Germany achieved excellent quality at 92% of almost 2 000 inland bathing sites. Background Local authorities collect water samples at selected bathing sites throughout the bathing season. The samples are then analysed for two types of bacteria, which indicate pollution from sewage or livestock. Polluted water can have impacts on human health, causing stomach upsets and diarrhoea if swallowed. Depending on the levels of bacteria detected, the bathing water quality is classified as \u2018excellent\u2019, \u2018good\u2019, \u2018sufficient\u2019 or \u2018poor\u2019. The EEA produces this annual report based on data from the previous bathing season, so this year's report is a compilation of data gathered in summer 2014, indicating the quality of bathing water expected in 2015.

Cities and businesses are implementing innovative solutions to adapt to climate change while also enhancing quality of life and protecting ecosystems. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director According to the EEA's new technical report 'Overview of climate change adaptation platforms in Europe', adaptation platforms in European countries mostly include information on policy action at transnational, national and subnational levels, scientific research output, guidance, decision-support tools, experiences from practice and implemented adaptation measures. Speaking at the second European Climate Change Adaptation Conference (ECCA), EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx said, 'Effective adaptation to climate change requires close cooperation between various stakeholders. Cities and businesses are implementing innovative solutions to adapt to climate change while also enhancing quality of life and protecting ecosystems'. Bruyninckx added, 'There is already a wealth of knowledge and experience available that should be shared, which can help all stakeholders to connect, be inspired and learn from each other. I believe new research programmes in the EU can further facilitate the co-creation of the knowledge base needed.' In recent years, many European countries have established information platforms on climate change adaptation. Currently, there are 14 national adaptation platforms across EEA member countries (Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) and two transnational platforms (the Alpine region and the Pyrenees). These are complemented by Climate-ADAPT \u2013 the European Climate Change Adaptation platform managed and maintained by the EEA in collaboration with the European Commission. In addition to country and European information, Climate-ADAPT also hosts a section on the Baltic Sea region. Of the 14 national adaptation platforms, seven are directly linked to the implementation of a national adaptation strategy or action plan. The EEA report also analyses links between adaptation platforms and climate services and disaster risk reduction platforms. Adaptation measures cover in general long-term and gradual impacts of climate change (e.g. sea level rise) as well as disasters linked to extreme weather events intensified by climate change (e.g. flooding). A closer collaboration between climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction platforms can boost the use of available knowledge and contribute to reduce vulnerability. In addition to presenting its new report and other findings on climate change, the EEA is organising two workshops on monitoring and evaluation of policies and on adaptation platforms, and participating in various sessions at the ECCA conference. EEA and climate change adaptation The EEA supports climate change adaptation through a series of assessments and by presenting its findings to various audiences including policy makers and the research community.

The European Union's Air Quality Directive sets four standards to reduce air pollution by ozone and its impacts on health: information threshold: 1-hour average ozone concentration of 180 \u03bcg/m3, alert threshold: 1-hour average ozone concentration of 240 \u03bcg/m3, long-term objective: the maximum daily 8-hour mean concentration of ozone should not exceed 120 \u03bcg/m3, target value: long-term objective should not be exceeded on more than 25 days per year, averaged over 3 years.\u00a0 Concentrations of ground-level ozone significantly exceeded these standards during summer 2014, according to the EEA's latest analysis. However, the number of exceedances was lower than in many previous years, in line with the long-term downward trend observed over the last 25 years. Depending on which threshold is exceeded, authorities in the affected areas and countries have to take specific measures. For example, exceeding the information threshold triggers an obligation to inform the population on possible risks, while exceeding the alert threshold requires authorities to take immediate action. Key facts \u2013 summer ozone 2014 Measurements were reported from 1607 monitoring stations across 30 European countries. Approximately 80% of these stations recorded at least one exceedance of the long-term objective between April to September 2014, with exceedances occurring in all reporting countries except Croatia, Estonia, Ireland, Romania and Serbia. Seven EU Member States (Austria, Cyprus, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, and Spain) had stations where ozone levels exceeded the long-term objective on more than 25 days. This corresponds to 6% of all reporting stations, affecting approximately 1% of the total population in the reporting countries. Averaged over the past three years, 16 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland) exceeded the 2012 target value. Ozone concentrations higher than the information threshold were reported from monitoring stations in 18 countries. No exceedances were reported by Andorra, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Lichtenstein, Lithuania, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and Sweden. Ozone concentrations higher than the alert threshold were reported only in France, on four occasions. Approximately 36% of the exceedances of the information threshold, 75% of exceedances of the alert threshold, and 20% of long-term objective exceedances took place during a single episode of high concentrations between 7 and 14 June 2014. \u00a0 More detailed information on ozone measurements in each country as well as background information on ozone are available in the briefing.

Since monitoring started under current legislation in 2010, emissions have decreased by 17\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km (12\u00a0%). Manufacturers will, nevertheless, have to further reduce emissions to meet the target of 95\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km by 2021. Key findings \u00a0 A total of 12.5 million new cars were registered in 2014, the first overall increase since 2007. Registrations increased in all EU Member States compared to 2013, except for Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands. A new car sold in 2014 emitted on average 123.4\u00a0grammes of g\u00a0CO2/km, significantly below the 2015 target of 130\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km. Europe had already reached its 2015 target by 2013, two years ahead of schedule. Average emissions levels in 2014 were below 130\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km in 17 of the 28 Member States. Significantly more efficient models were bought in the pre-2004 EU Member States compared to the newer EU Member States. The most efficient cars were bought in the Netherlands (107\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km), Greece (108\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km) and Portugal (109\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km), while the least efficient cars were bought in Estonia (141\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km), followed by Latvia (140\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km) and Bulgaria (136\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km).

Despite minor fluctuations in the past, the fuel efficiency of petrol cars has been catching up with that of the more fuel-efficient diesel cars in recent years. The average emissions gap between petrol and diesel is currently below 3\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km, around one seventh of the gap in 2000. Around 38\u00a0000 electric vehicles were registered in 2014, up by 57\u00a0% compared to 2013. The largest number of registrations was recorded in France (more than 10\u00a0700 vehicles), Germany (around 8\u00a0500 vehicles) and the UK (around 6\u00a0700 vehicles). Nevertheless, electric vehicles continue to constitute only a very small fraction of new registrations (0.3\u00a0%). EEA activities In accordance with EU Regulation (EC) No 443/2009, the EEA collects data on all passenger vehicles registered in Europe and makes it available online. The data collected includes information on CO2 emissions and vehicle mass. It is reported by all Member States in order to evaluate the performance of the new vehicle fleet towards the 2015 CO2 emissions target (130\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km). Type approval test procedure Member States report new vehicles\u2019 CO2 emission levels, calculated on the basis of a standardised driving cycle. This cycle allows a comparison of emissions by manufacturers, but it does not necessarily represent real-world driving conditions. Later this year, the EEA plans to publish a separate report highlighting the key reasons for the growing differences observed between official and real world driving emissions. Next steps While the average target for the collective EU fleet has been met ahead of the deadline, it has not yet been confirmed whether different manufacturers have met their own specific annual targets, based on the average mass of the cars they sell.

But it also shows that we continue to harm the natural systems that sustain our prosperity.\u00a0 Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director These are some of the key messages from the European Environment Agency's five-yearly assessment 'The European environment \u2013 state and outlook 2015' (SOER 2015), published today. SOER 2015 is an integrated assessment of Europe's environment. It also includes assessments and data at global, regional and country levels, as well as cross-country comparisons. EU policies have delivered substantial benefits Today, Europeans enjoy cleaner air and water, less waste is sent to landfill and more resources are recycled. However, Europe remains a long way from achieving the objective of 'living well within the limits of the planet' by 2050, as set out in the 7th Environment Action Programme. Although we use natural resources more efficiently than previously, we are still degrading the resource base that we rely on in Europe and across the world. Problems such as biodiversity loss and climate change remain major threats. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: 'Our analysis shows that European policies have successfully tackled many environmental challenges over the years. But it also shows that we continue to harm the natural systems that sustain our prosperity. While living within planetary limits is an immense challenge, there are huge benefits in responding to it. Fully using Europe's capacity to innovate could make us truly sustainable and put us at the frontier of science and technology, creating new industries and a healthier society.' SOER 2015 highlights the need for more ambitious policies to achieve Europe's 2050 vision. It also stresses the need for new approaches that respond to the systemic nature of many environmental problems. For example, external pressures, including global megatrends, can counteract specific policies and local environmental management efforts. In addition, many environmental challenges are closely linked to systems of production and consumption that support numerous jobs and livelihoods and changes to these systems create diverse costs and benefits. Moreover, efficiency improvements are often negated by increased consumption. The report concludes that although full implementation of existing policies will be essential, neither the environmental policies currently in place, nor economic and technology-driven efficiency gains, will be sufficient to achieve Europe's 2050 vision. Need to transform key systems Addressing the complex challenges facing Europe will require more ambitious policies, alongside better knowledge and smarter investments, aimed at fundamentally transforming key systems such as food, energy, housing, transport, finance, health and education. It will necessitate strategies and approaches aimed at mitigating pressures and avoiding potential harm, restoring ecosystems, correcting socio-economic inequities, and adapting to global trends such as climate change and resource depletion. Dr Bruyninckx continued: 'We have 35 years to ensure that we live on a sustainable planet by 2050. This may seem like a distant future, but to achieve our goal, we need to act now. We need our actions and investments to be even more ambitious and more coherent. Many of the decisions we make today will determine how we are going to live in 2050.' SOER 2015: selected facts and trends Natural capital EU policies have reduced pollution and have significantly improved the quality of Europe's air and water. However, continued ecosystem degradation threatens Europe's economic output and well-being. Biodiversity continues to be eroded. Sixty percent of protected species assessments and 77% of habitat assessments recorded an unfavourable conservation status. Europe is not on track to meet its 2020 target of halting biodiversity loss. Fresh water quality has improved over recent years, however, around half of Europe's freshwater bodies are unlikely to attain 'good ecological status' in 2015. Marine and coastal biodiversity is a particular area of concern. Pressures include sea floor damage, pollution, invasive alien species and acidification. Overfishing has decreased in the Atlantic and Baltic, but the Mediterranean shows a more negative picture, with 91% of assessed stocks overfished in 2014. Less than 6% of Europe's farmed area was used for organic agriculture in 2012, with large differences between countries. Looking ahead, climate change impacts are projected to intensify pressures and impacts and the underlying drivers of biodiversity loss are expected to persist. Resource efficiency Domestic resource consumption was 16.7 tonnes per person in 2007, declining to 13.7 tonnes in 2012, partly due to the collapse of the construction industry in some countries. Waste management has improved in recent years, with less waste generated and less waste sent to landfill. Recycling rates increased in 21 countries between 2004 and 2012, while landfilling rates decreased in 27 out of 31 countries (for which data are available). EEA countries achieved an average recycling rate of 29% in 2012, compared to 22% in 2004. Greenhouse gas emissions have decreased by 19% since 1990 despite a 45% increase in economic output. Fossil fuel use has declined, as have emissions of some pollutants from transport and industry. The 2008 financial crisis and subsequent economic difficulties also contributed to the reductions in some environmental pressures. It remains to be seen whether improvements will be sustained. Currently agreed policies are not sufficient for Europe to achieve its long-term environmental goals, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95%. Health and well-being Environmental policies have brought improvements in drinking water and bathing water quality, and have reduced exposure to key hazardous pollutants. Air and noise pollution continue to cause serious health impacts in urban areas. In 2011, about 430 000 premature deaths in the EU were attributed to fine particulate matter while noise exposure contributes to at least 10 000 premature deaths due to heart disease each year. The growing use of chemicals, particularly in consumer products, has been associated with an observed increase of endocrine diseases and disorders in humans. Projected improvements in air quality are not expected to be sufficient to prevent continuing harm, while impacts resulting from climate change are expected to worsen. The environment industry sector grew by more than 50% from 2000 to 2011, and is one of the few sectors to have flourished in terms of revenues and jobs since the 2008 financial crisis.\u00a0 Notes to the editor About the EEA The European Environment Agency (EEA) is an agency of the European Union. It aims to support sustainable development and to help achieve significant and measurable improvement in Europe's environment by providing timely, targeted, relevant and reliable information to policymaking agents and the public. It is supported in its work by the European environment information and observation network (Eionet), a network of 39 European countries. About SOER 2015 'The European environment \u2013 state and outlook 2015' is made up of two reports and 87 online briefings. These comprise the 'Synthesis' report and the 'Assessment of global megatrends' report, complemented by 11 global megatrends briefings, 25 European briefings, nine cross-country comparison briefings, 39 country briefings (based on national state of environment reports), and three regional briefings. SOER 2015: Provides a comprehensive, integrated assessment of the European environment's state, trends and prospects in a global context. Informs European environmental policy implementation between 2015 and 2020. Analyses the opportunities to modify existing policies (and the knowledge used to inform those policies) in order to achieve the European Union's 2050 vision of living well within the limits of the planet. It has been prepared as a joint undertaking in close collaboration with the Eionet, as well as European Commission services. In addition, several international organisations have been involved in the peer review of the assessment.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/future-prosperity-depends-on-bolder"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0280", "date": "2015-02-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Renewables successfully driving down carbon emissions in Europe", "text": "Renewable energy is quickly becoming one of Europe's great success stories. We can go even further: if we support innovation in this area it could become a major motor of Europe\u2019s economy, bringing down emissions while creating jobs. \u00a0 Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director Without the deployment of renewable energy since 2005, greenhouse gas emissions in 2012 could have been 7% higher than actual emissions, according to the EEA report 'Renewable energy in Europe \u2013 approximated recent growth and knock-on effects'. Renewable technologies also increase energy security, the report found. Without the additional use of renewable energy since 2005, the EU's consumption of fossil fuels would have been about 7% higher in 2012. The most substituted fuel was coal, where consumption would have been 13% higher, while natural gas use would have been 7% higher, at a time when European gas reserves are dwindling. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \"Renewable energy is quickly becoming one of Europe's great success stories. We can go even further: if we support innovation in this area it could become a major motor of Europe's economy, bringing down emissions while creating jobs.\" Renewable energy has not been the only factor reducing Europe's greenhouse gas emissions. Policies and measures designed to reduce emissions, improve energy efficiency and stimulate the deployment of renewable energy have all played a role. There were also other drivers for this reduction, including changing economic factors and shifts to less-polluting types of fuels. Other findings Final consumption of renewable energy increased in all Member States in 2013, according to EEA estimates. At EU level, the share of renewables increased to almost 15% by 2013, so the EU was ahead of its 12% target set by the Renewable Energy Directive. By 2020, the EU aims to generate at least 20% of its energy using renewable sources, rising to 27% by 2030. In Sweden, Latvia, Finland and Austria renewable energy made up more than a third of final energy consumption in 2013. At the other end of the scale, Malta, Luxembourg, Netherlands and the UK were all below 5%. The renewable heating and cooling market sector contributed most towards overall renewable energy in the EU in 2013. However, renewable electricity is growing faster. In contrast, the use of renewable energy sources in transport fell in 2013 in about half of the EU Member States and also at EU level. Coal, oil, gas and other fossil fuels still make up around three quarters of final energy consumption. Fossil fuels are the main cause of climate change, air pollution and several other environmental pressures. For Europe to meet ambitious decarbonisation targets, renewable energy sources are expected to increase to between 55 to 75% of final energy consumption by mid-century, according to the European Commission's Energy Roadmap 2050.

Higher environmental standards are major drivers of innovation in Europe, giving businesses a \u2018first-mover\u2019 advantage both at home and worldwide, according to an in-depth study of green economy policies. The environmental goods and services sector employed 4.2 million people in 2011, according to recent data. This represents a 44 % increase since 2000, far exceeding the European average of 7% jobs growth during the same period.\u00a0 Despite these encouraging signs, EEA analysis throughout 2014 showed that the EU still has a long way to go in its mission to 'live well, within the limits of the planet'. Around eight times as much raw material (by weight) is brought into the EU than exported. Extracting and transporting these resources have major environmental and economic costs, so Europe needs to use these precious resources more efficiently and increase recycling. Globally, competition for resources is increasing. Quality of life is still affected by many environmental factors \u2013 for example, almost all city dwellers in Europe continue to be exposed to pollution above World Health Organization guidelines. And approximately a quarter of the European population is exposed to noise levels above legal thresholds. There are strong economic arguments for addressing these problems. For example, the main industrial air pollutants alone had a hidden economic cost of at least \u20ac232 billion and possibly up to \u20ac672 billion over the five years between 2008 and 2012, according to a study carried out by the EEA in November. This includes the costs of premature death, poor health and damaged crops. Europe's seas were in the spotlight in March, when an EEA briefing showed that European industries have growing cumulative impacts on the sea, including transport, fishing, offshore energy and tourism. There was progress on climate change, as greenhouse gas emissions fell again in 2013, according to estimates published in October, putting the EU within reach of its 20% reduction target several years ahead of schedule.

When movement of people, goods or services is hindered, the indirect costs to the economy can be many times higher than the direct cost of damaged transport infrastructure. Despite these risks, adapting the transport system to climate change has received relatively little attention from policymakers to date. This message comes from 'Adaptation of transport to climate change in Europe', a new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA). Transport and climate risks Flooding can cause long-term disruption, as was the case in summer 2013, when flooding damaged the main railway bridge across the River Elbe in Germany, used by all trains to and from Berlin via Hannover, including high-speed services from Berlin to Frankfurt, Cologne and Dusseldorf. Infrastructure is also vulnerable to storms. This was demonstrated in February 2014, when the coastal section of the south\u2013west main line railway was destroyed in Dawlish, United Kingdom. The railway in the south-west of the UK was cut off from the rest of the network for two months. Rising temperatures and extended heatwaves can increase the problems of rail buckling, pavement deterioration and passenger discomfort. Sea-level rise can threaten harbours and other transport infrastructure and services at the coast. Climate change may also have indirect effects on transport. For example, it may lead to changes in tourist destinations or agricultural production, which can have an impact on transport demand. There has been limited progress in adapting Europe's transport system, although it is still not widespread. The report highlights several examples of early action, while 10 European countries refer to transport or transport infrastructure in some detail in their national adaptation strategies. Adapting transport infrastructure may be difficult because transport networks are highly complex, involving many different groups, from vehicle manufacturers to infrastructure managers to passengers. Another hurdle is the high cost of adapting hard transport infrastructure. One of the most cost-effective solutions is to consider adaptation measures when infrastructure is built or renewed. Moreover, those adapting can prevent 'locking-in' to unsustainable transport systems by taking a longer-term, systemic perspective, the EEA report says. At the European level, there are funds to help the transport system adapt to climate change. Action has also started on a project to revise European standards for infrastructure in light of climate change projections.

While car transport made up more than 70 % of this distance, it has continued to decline since 2009. In contrast, air transport has increased very fast over recent decades. One factor behind this pattern may be changing consumption habits. Some research suggests that younger generations prefer to spend their disposable income on long distance travel rather than consumer products such as cars. Nonetheless, there is a wide variation across the EU. Per capita car travel peaked in 2004 in the original 15 EU Member States, while it continues to grow in the 13 newer members. Overall passenger transport demand fell 1.4 % in 2012, mainly due to the drop in car passenger travel. Freight transport volumes also fell in 2012, by 2.1\u00a0%. Transport's total energy demand has also fallen, continuing its year-on-year decline since demand peaked in 2007. Because these trends may be partly caused by the recession, it is unclear whether this will rebound in coming years. Greenhouse gas emissions from transport fell 3.3 % in 2012, although they must continue to fall drastically meet targets over coming decades. Air pollutant emissions from most transport modes also decreased, apart from air pollution emitted by planes which increased for some pollutants. However, air quality is still harming health in Europe's cities. Levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulates in cities have been exacerbated by increasing proportions of diesel cars. This is partly a result of fuel tax policies in most European countries, which give preference to diesel over petrol-driven equivalents. The number of alternative fuel car registrations in 2013 increased slightly, compared to the previous year. Taken together, battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles account for 0.5 % of total new registrations in the EU. This sluggish growth may be partly due to incentives such as scrappage schemes and company car systems which continue to support internal combustion engine vehicles in many Member States. The new edition of the TERM report has a particular focus on long-distance travel. This area puts major pressure on the environment. While the vast majority of journeys are short distance, long distance freight and passenger transport demand together account for up to three-quarters of greenhouse gas transport emissions and a large proportion of air pollutant emissions.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/more-action-needed-to-reduce"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0288", "date": "2014-12-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Not just dirt: the importance of soil", "text": "The UN has declared 2015 the Year of Soils, to raise increase awareness and understanding of the importance of soil, for both food security and essential ecosystem functions.

The upper estimate is approximately equivalent to the GDP of Finland or half the GDP of Poland. Over the period 2008 - 2012 the estimated cost was at least \u20ac329 billion and possibly up to \u20ac1\u00a0053 billion. The findings come from 'Costs of air pollution from European industrial facilities \u2013 an updated assessment', which evaluates a number of harmful impacts caused by air pollution including premature death, hospital costs, lost work days, health problems, damage to buildings and reduced agricultural yields. The EEA uses a range of cost estimates as there are several existing methods currently used by policy-makers to calculate associated damage costs. The report also names the most damaging facilities in Europe\u00a0(use Chrome or Firefox)\u00a0and the costs in each country. Of the 30 individual facilities identified as causing the highest damage, 26 are power-generating facilities, mainly fuelled by coal and lignite and located predominantly in Germany and Eastern Europe. The\u00a0report does not assess whether a facility's\u00a0emissions are consistent with its legal requirements to operate.\u00a0 Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \"While we all benefit from industry and power generation, this analysis shows that the technologies used by these plants impose hidden costs on our health and the environment.

Three quarters of the total damage costs were caused by the emissions of 568 facilities \u2014 4 % of the total number. This does not mean that regulation should only apply to larger facilities, as smaller facilities can cause significant local pollution. Damage costs have declined over the five years monitored in the report, reflecting lower emissions reported by industrial facilities. This may be due to the impacts of legislation, improving plant efficiencies and the economic recession in Europe which caused lower rates of industrial activity in years immediately after 2008. Eight of the top 30 facilities are located in Germany; six are in Poland; four are in Romania; three are in Bulgaria and the United Kingdom, two are located in Greece; and the Czech Republic, Estonia, Italy and Slovakia all have one each. However, this ranking does not take efficiency into account \u2013 in some cases, larger plants may be more efficient than several smaller ones. Countries such as Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom, France and Italy, which have many large facilities, contribute the most to total damage costs. However, the ordering of countries changes significantly if damage costs are corrected to reflect the output of national economies. Emissions from a number of eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Romania, Estonia and Poland) then become more important. The report highlights the potential savings if more than 1\u00a0500 of Europe's large combustion plants were to reduce their future emissions in line with best practice.

Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The annual air quality report\u00a0collates data from official monitoring stations across Europe. It shows that almost all city dwellers are exposed to pollutants at levels deemed unsafe by the World Health Organization (WHO). For some pollutants, more than 95 % of the urban population is exposed to unsafe levels. Alongside the report, the EEA is publishing data showing pollution levels in almost 400 cities across Europe. While many large cities have relatively low levels of pollution, others have pollution levels above EU limits for a significant part of the year. \"Air pollution is still high in Europe,\" EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx said. \"It leads to high costs: for our natural systems, our economy, the productivity of Europe\u2019s workforce, and most seriously, the general health of Europeans.\" The most serious air pollutant is fine particulate matter, similar to dust or soot but with very small particles capable of penetrating deep into lungs. Long-term exposure to particulate matter was responsible for the vast majority of air pollution-caused premature deaths in Europe in 2011, the study shows, while high levels of ground level ozone over short episodes also caused a significant number of deaths. Most air pollutants have declined slightly over the last decade, including particulate matter and ozone. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), another pollutant, has not fallen as fast as expected. This is partly because vehicles are an important source of NO2, and vehicle emission standards have not always led to the anticipated reductions. The pollutant which increased the most over the last decade was benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). Emissions of this pollutant increased by more than a fifth between 2003 and 2012 as urban use of woodstoves and biomass heating increased. In 2012 almost nine out of ten city dwellers were exposed to BaP above WHO reference levels. An increasing body of scientific research shows that air pollutants may be more harmful than previously thought. Air pollution's effect on respiratory illnesses and heart disease is well known, but new studies have shown that it can also affect health in other ways, from foetal development to illnesses late in life. While most harm comes from long-term exposure, short-term episodes can also be very dangerous. For example, Paris experienced an extended episode of high air pollution earlier this year, when still weather allowed a build-up of particulate matter over several days. Alongside health, these pollutants also have a significant effect on plant life and ecosystems. These problems, including eutrophication, acidification and plant damage, have decreased in recent years. However, they are still widespread \u2013 for example the long-term objective for limiting ozone was exceeded across 87 % of Europe's agricultural area in 2012, the report shows.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/europes-cities-still-suffering-from"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0293", "date": "2014-10-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "River Mur recognised for effective river basin management", "text": "The River Mur rises in the Radst\u00e4dter Tauern and flows into the Drava in Croatia after a length of 453 km, 298 km of which are located in the Styria region of Austria. Systematic river regulation since the late 19th Century has separated the river loops, branches and floodplain forests which are important for the health of natural systems. Modifications including hydro-power stations and embankments have also degraded habitats. Nonetheless the Upper Mur is considered one of the most ecologically valuable rivers in Austria, not least because it is the natural breeding site of the Danube salmon. It also has the second largest alluvial forest in Austria, one of Europe\u00b4s most species-rich habitats. River management on the Mur has largely focused on restoring old structures and recovering natural river habitats by reconnecting them with the dynamic river-system. Besides environmental benefits, these measures have other advantages including better passive flood protection and new natural park areas for the residents.

Such measures show that management of the Mur is a good example of policy integration and stakeholder dialogue, two elements which are vitally important in successful river basin management. River basin management The European River Prize is given by the International River Foundation in partnership with the international association of water companies in the Danube river catchment and other partners from a wider area. An expert from the European Environment Agency (EEA) participated in the Judging Panel. Many of the discussions at the ERRC event underlined the importance of integrated management which considers all sectors in the river basin, such as agriculture, energy or spatial planning. Moreover, the conference emphasised that the objectives of the Water Framework Directive should be coordinated with other related legislation. This integrated approach requires intense coordination, transparency and effective dialogue on the very practical level of implementation at the river basin level. A recent EEA assessment recommended that water basin managers should strive to effectively engage the public and other stakeholders in the management process. Open dialogue between all actors along the river is the most practical way of integrating different policy processes on water, floods and biodiversity, ultimately ensuring better protection of the environment.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/river-mur-recognised-for-effective"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0294", "date": "2014-10-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Car and van makers continue to meet CO2 emission targets ahead of schedule", "text": "A new EEA report, 'Monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2013' presents final data for both vehicle types, updating preliminary data published earlier this year. The average passenger car sold in 2013 emitted 126.7 grams of carbon dioxide per passenger kilometre (g CO2/km), already below the legal threshold of 130 g CO2/km to be fully reached by 2015. Similarly, the average van sold must have emissions below 175 g CO2/km by 2017, but levels were already at 173.3 g CO2/km last year, according to the updated data from manufacturers and Member States. There were 11.8 million new cars and 1.2 million new vans registered in the EU in 2013. While both fleets overall are making progress in reducing emission levels, the picture is more mixed when manufacturers are considered individually. Each manufacturer has an individual emissions target, based on the average mass of the vehicles they sell. Manufacturers and CO2 emissions: key findings Updated data confirms findings from preliminary data published earlier this year, which showed that new cars in 2013 were on average 14 % more efficient than those sold in 2010. Of the individual car manufacturers, Renault had the lowest average CO2 emissions (110\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km) for new passenger vehicles registered in 2013. Renault, Toyota, Peugeot and Citroen continue to produce most of the lowest-emitting cars. Of the 84 car manufacturers in Europe, 55 met their individual specific emissions targets in 2013. These manufacturers represent 99 % of all registrations. Manufacturers can also choose to join 'pools' in order to meet a collective target. Once pools are taken into account, 72 manufacturers met their allocated targets. Manufacturers selling fewer than 1 000 vehicles may apply for an exemption from targets. While electric car numbers account for only a small proportion of total registrations, they are increasing rapidly. The number of purely electric cars in the EU has increased from around 700 in 2010 to around 25 000 in 2013. Plug-in hybrid numbers have also increased rapidly over recent years. Vans sold in 2013 were around 4 % more efficient than those sold in the previous year. The average emissions levels vary by country, with new vans sold in Malta, Portugal and France emitting on average 20 % less than vehicles sold in Slovakia, Germany and the Czech Republic Of the larger van manufacturers, the Renault fleet had the lowest average emissions, followed by Dacia, Peugeot and Citroen. Almost all van manufacturers that registered more than 10 000 vehicles met their specific emissions targets for 2013. Laboratory versus real world driving emissions Under the current EU regulations on cars and vans, both the test and vehicle monitoring are based on the New European Driving Cycle test, helping ensure that CO2 measurements of different vehicles are made on a comparable basis. However, over past years there has been a growing concern that this standardised test is not representative of 'real world' driving conditions. The EEA report includes a comparison of the reported test cycle CO2 emissions with estimated real world emissions. The assessment shows that real world driving conditions may lead to emissions around a fifth higher on average. The difference may be up to a third higher for larger cars, the report shows. A new test known as the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) will be introduced in the future so that laboratory results may better represent actual vehicle performance on the road.

Even against the backdrop of economic recession in recent years, we can see that policies and measures are working and have played a key role in reaching this interim result. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director According to EEA analysis of Member States' own projections, the EU is likely to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 21 % of 1990 levels by 2020, surpassing its 20 % target. With 14 % of final energy consumption generated by renewable sources in 2012, the EU is also ahead of the planned trajectory to hit 20 % renewable energy by 2020. Likewise, the EU's energy consumption is also falling faster than would be necessary to meet the 2020 energy efficiency target. \"Our analysis shows that Europe is on track towards its 2020 targets,\" Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said. \"Even against the backdrop of economic recession in recent years, we can see that policies and measures are working and have played a key role in reaching this interim result. But there is no room for complacency. The analyses we are publishing today also highlight countries and sectors where progress has been slower than planned.\" The picture at Member State level is more mixed compared to that at EU level. Nine countries were making good progress in pursuing the three linked policy objectives - greenhouse gas emissions reduction, renewable energy and energy efficiency - while no Member State was underperforming in all areas. However, three Member States are at risk of missing their individual targets for 2013 under the Effort Sharing Decision and projected greenhouse gas emissions for six Member States indicate that they will not achieve their 2020 targets through domestic policies and measures. Furthermore, projections from Member States show little or no emissions cuts in the transport and agriculture sectors. Beyond 2020 Last week, European heads of state and government agreed new headline targets for 2030, reducing greenhouse gases emissions by at least 40 % from 1990 levels, increasing renewable energy to make up at least 27 % of final energy consumption and a minimum 27 % reduction in energy consumption compared to business-as-usual. The current projections for 2030 indicate that further efforts are required at national and EU level to keep the EU on track towards its new 2030 targets, as well as its longer term objectives to decarbonise the European energy system and cut EU's greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 95\u00a0% by 2050.

It examines how water basin managers have involved the public and groups of stakeholders in eight river basins across Europe, looking at ways public participation can improve water management. The European Union's Water Framework Directive states that all river basins in Europe should be managed using a River Basin Management Plan. The public should be involved in creating this plan, in addition to other established stakeholders including private companies, conservation organisations, farmers, utilities and local government. The report recommends creating \"an environment of accessibility, receptiveness and mutual respect\", boosting transparency and trust among participants. Such an atmosphere can improve the 'buy-in' of those involved in implementing water management policies, improving the success rate of water management policies. The EEA report echoes Right2Water, the first successful European Citizen's Initiative accepted by the European Commission in March this year. The initiative aims to ensure access to water and sanitation across the EU. Key findings For a participatory process to be successful, the institutional set-up and processes need to be clear and transparent to all participants, the report says. A common understanding of responsibilities is also important, including an understanding of the institutions responsible for specific economic activities or geographical areas. Ultimately, participants need to know who they should address for particular aspects of the discussion. Various stakeholder groups need to feel that they have ownership of the water management plan. This improves the likelihood that they will fully implement the plans at a later stage. It is important to map the different groups with an interest in management of the river basin, the report finds. This can help to clarify what each stakeholder can bring to table in public participation, and help water managers tailor information accordingly. Practical activities involving stakeholders and the public seem to be the best way to increase trust and transparency in the participation process, the report notes. Face-to-face discussions are important. Trust is also increased by providing tangible evidence of how these discussions have influenced the development of the plan. Involving members of the general public appears to be more difficult than engaging with technical experts, so the report encourages river basin managers to improve communication, use modern communication methods and make technical explanations as clear and concrete as possible.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/river-basin-management-relies-on"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0297", "date": "2014-10-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Abundant 'natural capital' in Europe's faraway lands", "text": "Six European Union Member States have links to 34 Outermost Regions (ORs) and Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs).

It coincides with the 2014 Guadeloupe Conference, which will look at similar issues. Several EU overseas territories host a very high biological richness, including around 70 % of the species living in the EU and\u00a0its overseas entities. Natural capital includes this biodiversity and also vital services such as insect pollination of plants or the flood protection provided by forests. For many EU overseas territories, protecting natural capital is an important element of adapting to climate change. For example, healthy wetlands, coral reefs and mangroves can protect coastal settlements from floods and storms. Moreover, vegetation and other natural systems have an additional value in absorbing carbon emissions, mitigating climate change. Such natural capital directly underpins the economy in many overseas territories, the EEA briefing notes. Ecotourism is a vital source of income for many places, while several entities are heavily dependent on fishing. Nonetheless, human activity still threatens ecosystems in many overseas territories. Many species in overseas territories have evolved in isolation, which means invasive alien species pose a more serious threat than in continental Europe.

Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The European Environment Agency's indicator report 2014 looks at the transition to a green economy with a focus on the global environmental impacts of the EU's production-consumption systems. The report's launch coincides with the Global Green Growth Forum, being held in Copenhagen 20-21 October, where business leaders and decision makers are discussing how changing production and consumption patterns can bring about green growth. European Union environmental policy is framed by the ambition to \"live well within the limits of the planet\"\u00a0by 2050. Around half of some pressures from EU consumption are exerted outside the EU, including land use, water use and some air pollutant emissions, partly because consumer goods are increasingly produced abroad, the report notes. Europe's globalised impact can be positive, for example providing many jobs and generating a significant portion of national income in the exporting countries. But it can have some negative side-effects \u2013 unsustainable trends including large amounts of food waste across the whole food value chain, surging consumption of cheap clothes and increasing electricity consumption by European households, despite many appliances becoming more energy-efficient. Moreover, because the environmental and social effects of these trends are often exerted beyond Europe's borders they are difficult for European policy to influence and remain largely invisible to consumers. The EU is also highly dependent on the rest of the world for raw materials. When imports and exports are compared, it is clear that around eight times as much raw material (by weight) is brought into the EU than exported. The extraction and transport of these materials puts significant environmental pressure on the global environment. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \"The way we live and how we produce things has a substantial impact beyond our borders. In the past Europe has largely focused on policies to make European production more eco-efficient, but we can see that in a globalised world it is increasingly important that we fundamentally re-think how we consume and produce, to encourage true sustainability throughout the whole lifecycle of products.\" There are some positive societal trends that show the potential for production and consumption systems to become more sustainable. For example, many people have started to consume in different ways as new technologies make it easier to do things collectively, from sharing cars and work tools to managing community gardens. Consumers are also becoming producers in many cases, which can have environmental benefits. This trend towards 'prosumerism' may mean selling the electricity from rooftop solar panels or cooperatively producing and distributing food. Businesses can also play an important role, the report argues. Retailers have great power to influence the products people buy, for example by 'nudging' consumers towards more sustainable products or removing the most environmentally harmful choices altogether. New business models which use waste and take back used products may also help Europe use resources more efficiently.

Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The survey brings together detailed responses from 30 European countries, which are analysed in 'National adaptation policy processes in European countries - 2014', a new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA). Climate change adaptation is an issue on the political agenda in more than three quarters of countries, according to the survey. Almost all countries stated that extreme weather events have triggered adaptation responses. The second most cited reason for developing national adaptation policies was European Union policies integrating climate change adaptation, followed by damage costs and scientific research. Most countries identified barriers to taking action \u2013 more than three quarters of countries cited a lack of resources such as time, money or technologies as a barrier. 'Uncertainties about the extent of future climate change' and 'unclear responsibilities' were both seen as barriers by a large number of countries. Despite these difficulties, half the countries reported a high or very high willingness to develop policies and to adapt at the national level. Willingness to adapt may be linked to a growing awareness of climate change, which has increased over the last five years in two thirds of the countries covered, according to respondents. \"This is the first time European countries' adaptation efforts have been analysed comprehensively,\" Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said. \"Attention is often on efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and for good reason. But adaptation is inevitable, so it is positive that there is now political focus on this issue across Europe. Many countries now need to turn plans into action.\" Climate change is expected to affect Europe with increased floods, droughts, heatwaves, rising sea levels and other widespread environmental changes, such as changing species distribution and crop growing seasons. The EEA's climate change indicators show the extent to which these trends have already been observed in Europe and beyond. Despite a widespread awareness among politicians \u2013 21 countries have National Adaptation Strategies \u2013 concrete action is still at an early stage in many European countries. So far 13 countries are already implementing adaptation policies, according to the survey.

Prolonged exposure can trigger serious illnesses such as hypertension and heart disease. At the Bern meeting attended by noise experts from 39 countries, the EEA launched the 2014 update of its Noise Observation and Information Service for Europe (NOISE). NOISE is an interactive database illustrating exposure to harmful levels of noise across Europe's major transport networks and in more than 400 cities. It shows that road traffic is the dominant source of unhealthy exposure, with at least 61 million Europeans affected. Data from 69 airports reveal that almost 3 million citizens are adversely affected by aircraft noise near airports. Railway noise impacts almost 8 million people, while noise from Europe's largest industrial sites affects almost half a million people. The EEA aims to disseminate stories of successful action in reducing noise pollution through the European Soundscape Award. \u00a0 The winner of the European Soundscape Award 2014 The project Manual for Acoustic Planning and Urban Sound Design (MAP) won the European Soundscape Award 2014. Led by Sven Anderson, an urban acoustic planner at Dublin City Council, the project sought to encourage a deeper level of interest in the urban sound environment both within the city council and among the wider public. The project included two large public sound installations which are currently being set up at prominent urban locations in Dublin. Continuous Drift is an installation based around four retractable umbrellas that cover Meeting House Square, in Dublin's most popular tourist destination and cultural quarter. The umbrellas act as the backdrop for different sonic atmospheres which can be activated using mobile phones. The second installation, Glass House, listens to films being screened in an adjacent cinema, using their melodies to create a subtle sonic trace that hovers in the public space outside. In addition to the installations, the project included the three-day symposium Beyond Noise and Silence: Listening for the City and presentations at several international conferences. European Soundscape Award 2014 - runner-up prize The Department of Ecology at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki won the runner-up prize with the proposal for a practical methodology to identify Quiet Areas (QAs). \u00a0Quiet areas are defined as sites undisturbed by noise from traffic, industry or recreational activities under the Environmental Noise Directive. Identifying QAs using traditional measurement and modelling techniques can be costly and resource intensive, so the university developed a method involving mapping and land use data as a more efficient way to identify priority areas to protect from noise pollution.

Measured in 'CO2-equivalent' tonnes, showing their effect on the climate, F-gases currently make up approximately 2 % of the EU's overall greenhouse gas emissions. This proportion has increased as F-gas emissions have grown by almost 60 % since 1990. \u00a0 Industrial use of F-gases To control emissions of these gases, EU law introduced a series of measures in 2006 to prevent leaks and ban some uses of the gases.

The EEA report shows the use of F-gases (also known as 'net supply'), declined by 1.4 % in 2013. This was the third consecutive year of decline, according to the data reported by companies. Production of F- gases in the EU also fell in 2013, reversing a trend of increasing production in recent years. However, there was a 12 % increase in imports of these chemicals and a 2 % increase in exports. New laws from 2015 European laws have been revised in order to address the increasing contribution of F-gases to total EU greenhouse gas emissions.

This is an economic system\u00a0which retains resources, virtually eliminating waste disposal instead of extracting raw materials, using them once and throwing them away. In a truly circular economy, re-use, repair and recycling become the norm, and waste is a thing of the past. Keeping materials in productive use for longer, reusing them, and with improved efficiency would also improve EU competitiveness on the global stage. From a linear to a circular economy Europe took a step closer to the circular economy ideal recently, when the European Commission adopted a proposal to boost recycling and reduce landfill. The proposal includes more stringent targets for recycling, including targets to recycle 70 % of municipal waste and 80 % of packaging waste by 2030. It also includes a proposed ban on landfilling recyclable and biodegradable waste by 2025. Other targets aim to reduce marine litter and food waste. Achieving the new waste targets would create 580 000 new jobs, while making Europe more competitive and reducing demand for costly scarce resources, the Commission states. The proposals also mean lower environmental impacts and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Circular economy progress There is still a huge difference between recycling rates in different EU Member States, according to a report published last year, which looked at countries' progress towards the 2020 target to recycle 50 % of municipal solid waste.

These are a few of the many trends featured in 13 climate change indicators recently published by the European Environment Agency (EEA). Using graphs, maps and concise analysis, the indicators demonstrate some of the most important observations and projections of climate change and its impacts. The update also improves projections of future climate change. Global sea-level rise projections have been revised upwards, based on new climate models that better represent the effects of melting ice sheets on sea level rise. This indicator now also includes regional sea-level rise projections for the European regional seas. In addition, several indicators now include projections of further snow and ice decline. For example, if greenhouse gases continue to be emitted at high levels, the Arctic Ocean is projected to be nearly ice-free every September before mid-century. In many cases, the indicators feature information from the recent Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the physical science of climate change published in September 2013, although several indicators have been updated with even more recent information and adding trends and projections relevant for Europe.

These efforts range from public policy (adaptation strategies and action plans) to major infrastructure works. Some of these efforts are illustrated in several updated case studies featured on the Climate-ADAPT website. After several near-flood events in the Netherlands in the 1990s, the country decided to manage river flood risk differently in a project called \u2018Room for the River\u2019. One example is in the city of Nijmegen. The city is constructing an ancillary channel on the flood plains and an urban river park. These measures allow more water to be stored in the event of high river water levels. There are also other benefits, including room for living, recreation, cultural events, and wildlife. For Zaragoza in Spain, climate change presents a very different problem. In 1996, drought and projections of declining river flows prompted Spain\u2019s fifth largest city to promote a \u2018water saving culture\u2019 with revised water tariffs and positive examples of how people and businesses can use water more efficiently. A parallel programme of upgrading infrastructure also helped reduce water use by reducing leaks and upgrading waste water treatment. Over fifteen years, the city cut water consumption by almost 30 %. Climate-ADAPT is an online portal with a wealth of information on how the EU, countries, cities or municipalities can best adapt to climate change. It has recently been revamped to include new or improved case studies, search features, country information, an updated adaptation support tool and more extensive pages on the funding opportunities available for adaptation.

This is not just about new inventions \u2013 encouraging the uptake and diffusion of new green technologies may be even more important.\" Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director 'Resource-efficient green economy and EU policies' considers how European economies can drive more efficient material resource use as part of the transition towards a 'green economy', a recently stated aim of the EU. While many environmental trends are gradually improving, the EU needs a more fundamental, systemic re-orientation of its economy if is to meet some of its long-term environmental objectives, the report states. For example, the proposed EU target to cut greenhouse gases by 80-95 % of 1990 levels by 2050 will not be possible by solely relying on incremental efficiency gains. \"Innovation may be the single most important driver to change the inefficient way we currently use resources,\" EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx said. \"Environmental innovation is key to address the challenges of the 21st Century. If we want to 'live well within the ecological limits of the planet' as stated in the 7th Environmental Action Programme, we will need to rely heavily on Europe's inventiveness. This is not just about new inventions \u2013 encouraging the uptake and diffusion of new green technologies may be even more important.\" Another lever for improving resource efficiency could be to reduce labour taxes such as income tax, instead taxing inefficient resource use and environmental pollution. Such environmental taxes could encourage job creation but are under-used in the EU, equivalent to only 2.4 % of GDP in 2012. There may be multiple benefits - countries with the highest environmental taxes also seem to rank very highly for eco-innovations and competitiveness. Strong environmental regulation can give the EU a competitive advantage as an early adopter, the report argues. Other regions which want to import products into the EU are gradually adopting European norms such as vehicle emissions standards or chemical controls. The EU aims to increase the share of manufacturing to 20 % of GDP by 2020, from 15.1 % in 2013. This could be an opportunity to boost environmentally-beneficial innovation in areas such as renewable energy, according to the report authors. However, they warn that such growth must be consistent with EU environmental priorities, otherwise it could have negative consequences including increasing greenhouse gas emissions and wasting valuable resources. The economic crisis and environmental efforts The economic crisis seems to have had an effect on some environmental issues in the EU, including partially reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and some air pollutants. Nonetheless, in most areas Europe seems to be on a similar trajectory as it was before 2008, continuing long term trends; \u00a0in some other cases the crisis seems to have slowed progress. Following the 2008 financial and economic crisis there were some expectations that additional public investment could encourage more efficient resource use in Europe. However, indicator trends suggest that these efficiency gains have not occurred.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/the-2018green-economy2019-can-encourage"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0308", "date": "2014-06-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Air pollution still harming Europe's ecosystems, despite reduced emissions", "text": "We are still struggling to protect sensitive ecosystems from harmful effects such as eutrophication. It is particularly striking that the problem appears to be just as bad in Europe's protected natural areas. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director 'Effects of air pollution on European ecosystems' assesses the proportion of European ecosystems exposed to nitrogen and sulphur-containing pollutants above sustainable levels. When pollutants exceed these levels they can harm plants and animals. In the 1970s, many European governments became increasingly concerned about acid rain, which was damaging forests and killing fish such as the brown trout and Atlantic salmon. The report shows that acidification has been greatly reduced since its peak in 1980 when almost half of the sensitive ecosystem area in the 28 EU Member States was affected. This has been reduced to around 5 % of ecosystems today, the report finds. Air pollution also contributes to eutrophication, an oversupply of nitrogen. This can change ecosystems, for example creating conditions more favourable to certain plants, thus reducing the 'species richness' in grasslands and other sensitive areas. Eutrophication from air pollution peaked in 1990 with around 80 % of sensitive ecosystems in the EU exposed above safe levels. Despite some improvements almost 60 % of the ecosystems are still affected. While the situation is set to improve further, the report indicates that air pollution will cause significant eutrophication for some years to come. Reduced emissions, healthier ecosystems The improving trends are the result of deep cuts in the emissions of some pollutants over the last few decades. The second report published today documents the changes in air pollutant emissions since 1990. This report is submitted annually by the EU to the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP). Sulphur dioxide (SOx) is a major cause of acidification. Tackling SOx emissions has been a major success story of EU regulation, with emissions falling 84 % between 1990 and 2012. This was largely due to policies which aimed to switch fuels, install flue gas scrubbers in industrial plants and reduce the sulphur content of transport fuel. The pollutants causing eutrophication have also fallen, albeit not as much as SOx \u2013 for example emissions of nitrogen oxides and ammonia have fallen by 51 % and 28 % respectively. However, the report shows that 11 countries still exceeded internationally agreed Gothenburg Protocol limits for these pollutants in 2012. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director said: \"Although air pollution does not cause as much harm as it once did, we are still struggling to protect sensitive ecosystems from harmful effects such as eutrophication.

It shows how we often extract limited resources faster than the planet can produce them, turn them into products using environmentally harmful processes and then discard these products after a limited period of use. Our consumption has a significant environmental impact: Europeans used almost 16 tonnes of materials per capita in 2011. This varies across Europe, with Finns using around 30 tonnes of resources per year while the average Maltese citizen only consumed five tonnes. Consumption habits are changing \u2013 for example Europeans eat twice as much meat as they did 50 years ago, which increases demand for land and other resources. Europeans generated 4.5 tonnes of waste per capita in 2010. Approximately a third of food is wasted in the EU. Of this waste, approximately two fifths is wasted during the manufacturing process and another two fifths are discarded in homes. The publication also includes many solutions which could 'green' the economy. Better consumer choices, more recycling and even improvements in town planning can help, according to some of the experts interviewed in Signals. Together, these ideas could effectively create a 'circular economy', where waste becomes a resource to be reused.

Policies have been at the heart of this success. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The findings come from final EU greenhouse gas emissions for 2012, reported to the United Nations. Emissions have decreased by 1 082 Mt in the EU since 1990, which is more than the combined 2012 emissions of Italy and the United Kingdom. As a result, the EU was already very close to reaching its 2020 Climate and Energy Package target through domestic measures alone. The first 15 EU Member States are also joint signatories to the Kyoto Protocol, with a collective target of 8 % average reduction over the period 2008-2012. This group of countries have reduced emission by an average of 11.8 % during 2008-2012 compared to base year without counting 'sinks' or credits from Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms. The emission reduction from 2008 to 2012 in the EU15 was in absolute terms greater than Spain's total emissions in 2012. Why did emissions fall in the EU in 2012? Emissions fell by 1.3 % between 2011 and 2012, largely due to reductions in transport and industry and a growing proportion of energy from renewable sources. Italy alone accounted for 45 % of the total EU net reduction in emissions in 2012, largely due to lower emissions from transport and industry. The second largest reduction, in Poland, was mainly due to a substantial decrease in solid fuel consumption. In contrast to their overall decreasing emission trend since 1990, the United Kingdom and Germany increased emissions in 2012 because of increased use of solid fuels. Greenhouse gas emissions and changes in GDP The EEA technical analysis of emission trends shows that changes in GDP, for example growth or recession, can explain up to one third of the change in total greenhouse gas emissions since 1990. During periods experiencing recession (including in the 2008-2012 period), changes in GDP can explain less than 50 % of observed emission reductions for the EU as a whole. Other factors and policies have played at least as important a role in reducing emissions, including the sustained and strong growth in renewable energy and improvements in energy efficiency. Although GDP is a significant factor behind changes in greenhouse gas emissions on an annual basis, GDP and greenhouse gas emissions show an absolute \u00a0'decoupling' when compared to 1990, according to the EEA analysis. While GDP has increased 45 % since 1990, emissions have fallen 19 %, halving EU's 'emission intensity', the volume of emissions generated for each euro of GDP. In addition, Member States' emission intensities have been converging. Per capita greenhouse gas emissions in the EU have decreased by almost a quarter since 1990, from 12 to nine tonnes. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \"The EU has demonstrated that there is no conflict between a growing economy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Policies have been at the heart of this success. We need to go even further, but this will depend on countries implementing policies which already map a path towards a low carbon, energy secure society.\" The downward emission trajectory seems to have continued in 2013, according to emissions data from EU Emissions Trading System and early estimates based on energy statistics from Eurostat.

The data is published by the European Environment Agency (EEA), which started monitoring the emissions of light commercial vehicles last year.

The vans data is more complex than that of passenger cars, due to the relatively high number of vehicles type-approved in multiple stages - for example camper vans, where different parts are built by different manufacturers. In the case of multi-stage vans, the base vehicle manufacturer is responsible for the CO2 emissions of the final vehicle under EU law. Moreover, as the database is relatively new, the current monitoring system cannot adequately capture these vehicles, which means that the data is not yet fully representative of the new vans targeted by the legislation. From next year onwards, a new data collection method will apply which is expected to improve data quality.

These countries were followed by Malta (99 % deemed excellent), Croatia (95 %) and Greece (93 %). At the other end of the scale, European Union Member States with the highest proportion of sites with a 'poor' status were Estonia (6 %), the Netherlands (5 %), Belgium (4 %), France (3 %), Spain (3 %) and Ireland (3 %).

Today's challenge comes from short-term pollution loads during heavy rain and flooding. This can overflow sewage systems and wash faecal bacteria from farmland into the rivers and seas.\" Local authorities monitor the samples at local beaches, collecting samples in the spring and throughout the bathing season. Bathing waters can be rated 'excellent', 'good', 'sufficient' or 'poor'. The ratings are based on levels of two types of bacteria which indicate pollution from sewage or livestock. These bacteria can cause illness (vomiting and diarrhoea) if swallowed. Bathing water ratings do not consider litter, pollution and other aspects harming the natural environment. While most bathing sites are clean enough to protect human health, many of the ecosystems in Europe's water bodies are in a worrying state.

However, the region needs to work even harder together if it is to meet its target to depollute the sea by 2020. EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx The \"Horizon 2020 Mediterranean report - Toward shared environmental information systems\"\u00a0 has been coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the United Nations Environment Programme/Mediterranean Action Plan\u00a0with financial support from the European Commission under the ENPI-SEIS project. It is part of the mid-term review of the Horizon 2020 Initiative, which aims to reduce pollution in the Mediterranean between 2006 and 2020. It focuses on three main environmental topics: waste water and sanitation, solid municipal waste and industrial emissions. The report covers Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine and Tunisia, which work with the European Union within the European Neighbourhood Policy. Key findings Sanitation has improved steadily in the region over the last decade. Between 2003 and 2011 the proportion of the population with access to sanitation increased from 87.5 to 92 %. There are still 17.6 million people in the region without sanitation, a third of them living in urban areas. There is great potential to reuse wastewater in the region, the report says. Currently only around 1 % of wastewater is reused, so it is possible to make better use of this resource instead of discharging it into the sea. Progress in urban wastewater management is difficult to assess as the data available do not provide sound evidence on trends at the regional level, the report notes. While solid waste generated in the region is still approximately half the per capita level in the EU, waste generation in the southern Mediterranean region has grown approximately 15 % over the last decade, mostly due to a growing population and increased consumption. Waste management needs significant improvement, the report finds. Around three quarters of waste is collected, but most of this is still disposed of in open dumps, which can have health impacts and find its way into the sea leading to environmental problems. Less than 10 % of the waste collected in the region is recycled, the report says. Industrial emissions have a heavy impact on the Mediterranean. While pollution from heavy metals in seawater has decreased in recent years, local marine pollution from cities, industry and tourist resorts is still leading to widespread pollution of seas and beaches. \u00a0 Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \"Countries have put tremendous efforts into submitting data and seeking a better understanding of the pressures on the Mediterranean, an important step in cutting the pollution of the sea. However, the region needs to work even harder together if it is to meet its target to depollute the sea by 2020.\" There are still many data gaps for the topics covered by the report, in particular for wastewater management. Countries should also invest in creating an emissions inventory to show annual emissions of pollutants from different industrial facilities, the report says. Despite the multiplicity of activities already being carried out by civil society and governments in the region to tackle the pollution problem, there is still scope for intensifying cooperation and information sharing. This is a necessary step towards regular progress in assessing the status of the Mediterranean. Applying all these measures could make policy more effective in reducing pollution in coming years.

The data used in the report represents the water using habits of approximately 50 million people. The report comes shortly after a commitment from the European Commission to improve the transparency and accountability of water service providers by giving citizens access to comparable data on the key economic, technical and quality performance indicators. The commitment is a response to a European Citizen's Initiative, where more than one million citizens signed a petition demanding a 'right to water'. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cThere are few resources more vital than water. Despite huge improvements in the way we treat it, transport it and dispose of it, there are still severe environmental impacts. Water utilities can play a major role in making Europe's water use more efficient, so it would be good to have more data to compare their environmental performance.\u201d Key findings The volume of water lost due to leaks and other unbilled water use varies hugely across Europe. For example, data from Germany, Denmark, France and Sweden showed average values from 1 to 10 m3 from every kilometre of pipe every day. In a separate assessment, average distribution losses were around 8.5m3/km/day, according to benchmarking data from 32 large utilities serving around 75 million people across Europe. Such losses are particularly important in water-scarce areas. Waste water treatment is more effective in larger treatment plants, the data shows. Larger plants released relatively lower levels of nutrient emissions compared to smaller facilities. Nutrient pollution causes eutrophication, which is leading to oxygen-free 'dead zones' in seas, lakes and rivers. Producing, transporting and treating water all require energy. Urban water management uses approximately 5.5 % of households' overall electricity consumption, which is the equivalent of each person constantly running a 10\u00a0W light bulb. This does not include the management of industrial wastewater or storm-water run-off. \u00a0 The report aims to help the EU achieve its aims to use resources more efficiently.

Of these, approximately 14 % (340\u00a0000 sites) are expected to be contaminated and likely to require remediation. Approximately one third of these contaminated sites have already been identified and around 15 % have been remediated. \u00a0Traditional remediation involves excavating the contaminated soil and disposing of it in another location. The findings are based on data collected through the European Environment Agency (EEA) network. They are published in a new report from the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, 'Progress in the management of contaminated sites in Europe'. The data is also published on the EEA website as an indicator assessment. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \"Managing contaminated land in Europe costs an estimated \u20ac 6.5 billion per year.

The largest cause of soil contamination is poor waste management, so preventing waste in the first place could reduce the burden to society.\" Municipal and industrial waste disposal and treatment causes around a third of Europe's soil contamination problem. Metal industries and petrol stations are also common sources of soil contamination, while mining is an important source in some countries. The most frequent contaminants are mineral oils and heavy metals. The EU Soil Thematic Strategy gives guidance on protecting soil functions and preventing soil degradation. However, here is no EU framework legislation to protect soil, although several laws provide direct or indirect controls on soil contamination.\u00a0 Compare countries and explore data Explore and compare estimated countries contaminated sites in the following interactive chart.

However, manufacturers will have to keep reducing emissions levels to meet the target of 95g CO2/km by 2021. \"The average car sold last year was almost 10 % more efficient than the average car sold in 2010, when monitoring started,\" EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx said. \"This is good news. But passenger transport still generates a significant part of total greenhouse gas emissions of the EU, so we need to think about more sustainable transport systems \u2013 the car cannot solve all our problems in the 21st Century.\" Key findings Notably, new cars have become more efficient despite an increase in the average mass. The main drivers of efficiency have been technological improvements and higher sales of diesel cars, which typically have lower emissions levels than petrol equivalents. However, the preference for diesel seems to be falling, making up just over half the cars sold in 2013. The efficiency gap between new petrol and diesel vehicles has been decreasing in recent years. Compared to the current levels the average emissions gap between petrol and diesel was more than 10 times higher in 2000. There were 11.8 million new cars registered in the EU in 2013. This figure has declined continuously since its peak in 2007, when 15.5 million vehicles were registered. There were 24 000 electric vehicles registered in 2013, which is a small fraction of the fleet but which represents a 71 % increase on 2012 numbers. Around 31 000 plug-in hybrid cars were registered in 2013. On average, the most efficient cars were bought in the Netherlands (109g CO2/km), Greece (111g) and Portugal (112g) while the country selling the least efficient cars was Latvia (147g) followed by Estonia (147g) and Bulgaria (142g). The biggest cars, measured by mass, were bought in Latvia, Sweden and Luxembourg. People in Malta, Denmark and Greece bought the lightest models on average. There seem to be two distinct markets in Europe, with older EU Member States buying significantly more efficient models compared to newer members.

But in most cases, the real health problems are caused by long-term exposure to noise from road traffic, railways, airports or industry. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director A quiet area is not necessarily silent, but rather one that is undisturbed by unwanted or harmful sound created by human activities, according to the 2002 Environmental Noise Directive. Indeed, some types of noise such as the sound of running water or birdsong are usually perceived as enjoyable. This means that it may not be possible to define a quiet area by just measuring decibels. A new European Environment Agency (EEA) report, \u2018Good practice guide on quiet areas\u2019, provides guidance and recommendations for authorities who need to identify and maintain these places. Its publication marks International Noise Awareness Day, 30 April 2014. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cWhen we think about noise pollution, we often think about loud music or a neighbour\u2019s barking dog. But in most cases, the real health problems are caused by long-term exposure to noise from road traffic, railways, airports or industry. Quiet areas are important because they can provide respite from noise, ultimately improving quality of life.\u201d Different solutions for different places There are many different interpretations of what a quiet area means in practice, and how they should be preserved. This is understandable \u2013 an appropriate scheme in one place may not suit another location. The report provides an overview of quiet area measures across Europe. For example: In Dublin, Ireland, the City Council combined noise modelling and measurement to identify long term average noise levels below the levels that harm health, subsequently designating and protecting eight quiet areas in the city;\u00a0 \u00a0 In Oslo, Norway, authorities asked \u2018key persons\u2019 with knowledge of potential areas and mapped noise \u00a0to identify 14 areas of quiet that are easily accessible by local people; A slightly different approach was taken in Tallinn, Estonia, where many different criteria were used to identify recreational areas in with low average levels of long-term noise. Elsewhere, the scheme also aims to protect rural areas undisturbed by noise from traffic, industry or recreational activities. The European Soundscape Award 2014 - open for applications Another approach to the problem of noise is the idea of soundscapes, creating healthier and quieter environments. The European Soundscape Award 2014 aims to draw attention to the most innovative product, campaign, innovation or scheme solving a noise problem.

As the latest report notes, we will need concerted global efforts to both mitigate the problem and adapt. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director According to the IPCC WGIII report \"Mitigation of Climate Change\u2019 (part three of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report), global population growth and economic growth have outpaced the emissions-reducing effects of energy efficiency improvements and decarbonisation of energy sources. Reversing this trend means emissions reductions should go beyond the Canc\u00fan Pledges, and requires major technological and institutional changes to roll out renewable energy and other low carbon technologies. Reducing deforestation is also part of this effort. The report also notes that it will be important to change behaviour, in order to to reduce the demand for energy and material consumption. Immediate global action would improve chances of keeping average global warming below the internationally agreed target of 2\u00b0 C increase since pre-industrial levels. Ambitious mitigation is projected to have a minimal effect on economic growth, reducing it by only approximately 0.06 percentage points a year. If action is delayed, keeping warming below this level will depend on technologies to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which are unproven at a large scale and likely to be much more expensive than emissions reductions. The report also outlines additional benefits from prompt action, including improved air quality and energy security. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cThe longer we delay in mitigating climate change, the narrower our options become. As the latest report notes, we will need concerted global efforts to both mitigate the problem and adapt. In Europe, we have seen how emissions can be driven down \u2013 we need to boost these efforts everywhere, in Europe and beyond.\u201d While global emissions continue to rise, the trend in Europe is different - emissions have fallen over the last two decades. The European Union is already close to its target of 20 % emissions reduction by 2020. This success has been due to a combination of factors, including renewable energy policies, increasing energy efficiency and economic circumstances, according to EEA analysis. The European Commission has proposed a new target for 2030, to reduce emissions by 40 % of 1990 levels.

We need to improve this situation by making further emissions cuts. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director Under the National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive, EU Member States have individual emission limits, known as 'ceilings', that were to be achieved by 2010 for four different pollutants: sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC). An early analysis of the official data shows that 11 Member States breached at least one ceiling in 2012, compared to 10 countries in 2011. As in previous years, the most commonly breached ceiling was nitrogen oxide (NOx), with nine Member States exceeding their designated levels. Road transport contributes around 40 % of total EU NOx\u00a0emissions and is one of the main factors behind the large number of NOx\u00a0exceedances \u2013 reductions from this sector over the last two decades have not been as large as originally anticipated. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director said: \"Air pollution is still a very real problem - just look at the high concentrations of air pollution recently seen across large areas of western Europe.

While new technologies and practices can help, we also need to encourage individuals to take action, for example by encouraging alternatives to car use.\" Two countries \u2013 Denmark and Finland \u2013 exceeded the limit for ammonia (NH3), while only Luxembourg breached the ceiling for non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC). Luxembourg was the only country to breach two ceilings in 2012, for NOx and NMVOC. All 27 Member States met the sulphur dioxide (SO2) limits. The data show that several countries have persistent problems meeting their national emission limits \u2013 for example, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and Spain breached NOx ceilings in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Denmark and Finland have exceeded the NH3 ceilings for three years running.

In December 2013 the European Commission proposed a new Clean Air Policy Package, following an in-depth review of current EU air policy. A key objective of the legislative package is to ensure that countries comply with existing legislation by 2020. A second aim of the package is to reduce the longer term impacts of air pollution. The package proposes revising the NEC Directive, with new 2020 and 2030 reduction commitments for the four currently-covered pollutants, as well as new ceilings for two additional pollutants \u2013 fine particulate matter (PM2,5) and methane (CH4).", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/eleven-countries-exceed-air-pollutant"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0327", "date": "2014-03-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Eight facts about Europe\u2019s forest ecosystems", "text": "In Europe, forests cover around 35% of the land area (190 million ha), making Europe one of the most forest-rich regions in the world. The recent increase in European forest cover is a result of national legislation, afforestation and natural expansion over the last 200 years. Forests are an economic resource. Forests generate income for more than 16 million private forest owners, and forest activities have a turnover of almost \u20ac 500 billion, employing approximately 3.5 million people. Forests provide unseen services: Alongside wood and other products, forests are also valuable for their \u2018ecosystem services\u2019. For example, more than 20 % of European forests are managed to protect water and soils, mainly in mountainous areas. Other services include preventing floods and filtering air. Forests help mitigate climate change impacts. European forests absorb approximately 10% of Europe's annual greenhouse gas emissions, according to the latest State of Europe\u2019s forests report.\u00a0 Forest structures in the EU are becoming more uniform, as the variety of tree species is reduced. This means forest biodiversity is lost, making these ecosystems less resilient to pests, disease and a changing climate. Natural forest once covered most of Europe, but only a very small proportion remains untouched, mostly in isolated pockets. But many forest ecosystems are in poor health. The effects of poor forest management can be seen in the population of woodland birds, which declined more than 30% in some regions of Europe between 1980 and 2005. The IUCN estimated in 2009 that 27 % of mammal species, 10 % of reptiles and 8 % of amphibians related to forests are threatened with extinction in the EU. Invasive alien species are increasingly a problem for European forests. There are around 1 800 species in Europe\u2019s forests which are invasive and alien to the natural environment. For example, European forests have been devastated by Dutch elm disease caused by fungi introduced from Asia, and grey squirrels are outcompeting red squirrels. Globally, invasive alien species are one of the largest causes of biodiversity loss. Climate change is very likely to harm forest ecosystems. One area which may change is the pattern of forest fires. On average, around 400 000 ha of forest currently burns down every year, mostly in the Mediterranean region.

Check the EEA\u2019s near-real time air pollution map. The main factor behind the current air pollution episode has been the stable and calm weather over the past days, which prevents certain types of air pollution from dispersing. The pollutants are emitted by a variety of sources, including road traffic, wood-burning stoves, and at this time of year the application of agricultural fertilisers. The current episode is particularly high, however \u2013 in France, the last major pollution episode of this kind was in spring 2007.\u00a0 Urgent action Yesterday evening the French Ministry of Ecology announced a series of actions to reduce short-term pollution levels including free public transport in the Paris area until Sunday in order to limit traffic emissions. The Ministry has also reduced traffic speed limits in certain areas, introduced controls on fertiliser spreading and advised against use of wood-burning fireplaces (except for main heating) and burning of green waste.

Recent scientific studies have shown that ground-level ozone pollution is harmful even at very low levels. This means that levels are still far too high, even though the the limits were exceeded on fewer occasions than in many previous years. Moreover, this does not necessarily mean that exposure is falling a corresponding amount. A separate study found that in 2012, almost all inhabitants of cities in the EU were exposed to ozone levels above World Health Organisation guidelines, which are stricter than the EU limits. Ground-level ozone is a 'secondary pollutant', which means it is formed in chemical reactions between other pollutants in the air. It is a particular problem during the summer as it forms in warm weather. High ozone concentrations can cause serious health problems, especially respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular problems, leading to premature death in some cases. It also damages vegetation such as agricultural crops.

In many cases, these areas are also home to Europe's large wild animals, including the brown bear, wolf, reindeer and lynx. This underscores the need for effective conservation and restoration, the report says. Roads, towns and other developments continue to fragment habitats, splitting wildlife populations into smaller groups, reducing the gene pool and making species more vulnerable to pressures such as climate change. The report authors map several corridors where the environment could be restored in order to reconnect habitat fragments. There is some uncertainty in this analysis, the report notes. However, it provides a useful starting point for identifying priority areas for conservation and potential restoration. Multiple benefits of green infrastructure The multiple benefits of green infrastructure were highlighted in EU Green Infrastructure Strategy, published last year. For example, in cities trees and green areas can prevent flooding, reduce air pollution and reduce noise levels.

This waste sometimes originates hundreds of kilometres from the sea. It can harm marine animals, and may end up in human food. The EEA has created a new mobile phone app to help monitor this problem. Climate change also harming ecosystems.\u00a0Over the last quarter century, sea surface temperature has increased at approximately 10 times the average rate since records began in 1870. Acidification from CO2 changing habitats:\u00a0pH has reduced from 8.2 to 8.1 over the industrial era, making the seas 26 % more acidic. For comparison this is approximately 100 times faster than over the previous 55 million years. Yet there are still data gaps: Member State reporting under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive is patchy, only covering two thirds of the EU sea area. There are other gaps \u2013 for example, little is reported on the status of marine invertebrates, mammals and reptiles.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/ten-things-everyone-should-know"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0333", "date": "2014-02-26", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Mapping habitats to describe ecosystems", "text": "Habitat and vegetation mapping often incorporate many different methods, including on-the-ground surveys, satellite observations and statistical analysis. Some mapping studies also show what vegetation might look like if human pressures were removed. In Europe there is a long tradition of such mapping, which has increased since the adoption of the 1992 European Union Habitats Directive. A new report, \u2018Terrestrial habitat mapping in Europe: an overview\u2019, includes in-depth information on recent mapping work, a historical perspective and a review of current methods. The report includes contributions from more than 70 scientists. It was initiated by the French National Museum of Natural History to serve national purposes, and subsequently published as a joint European report by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the museum. It was written with the support of EIONET, the EEA network. The report focuses on projects which cover large areas, often entire countries, at relatively large scales (typically 1:50 000) and using related classification systems developed in the field of phytosociology, the study of plant communities. Several projects are described in some detail, in order to highlight the variety of methods used and the level of organisation required for successful projects. Vegetation scientists have made significant advances in the development of habitat mapping across Europe, the report says, although there is still a need to make classification systems compatible, which is one of the aims of the EEA\u2019s EUNIS habitat classification.\u00a0 Mapping habitats clearly plays an important role in improving knowledge to support implementation of the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy.

The three indicators look at pollutant emissions from the agricultural sector, households and manufacturing industries, comparing this pollution to economic factors. 'Absolute decoupling' is the implicit aim of many environmental policies, meaning economic growth continues while environmental impacts decrease. 'Relative decoupling' is often used to describe a situation where environmental impacts continue to increase, but at a lower rate than growth. The data suggests that Europe is generally moving in the right direction in reducing nutrient pollution of water, a major cause of eutrophication. It is still a significant pollution problem, however. Manufacturing industries have also significantly cut their emissions of heavy metals to water between 2004 and 2010, the data shows. However, at the national level a handful of countries do not show an absolute decoupling trend, either with falling rates of productivity or increasing pollutant emission levels.

Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director Many European industries have growing cumulative impacts on the sea, including transport, fishing, offshore energy and tourism. 'Marine messages'\u00a0highlights the vulnerable nature of Europe's marine ecosystems, which may be irreversibly damaged if they continue to be exploited beyond sustainable limits.\u00a0 European countries need better information to help them understand the nature of these limits, the briefing says. The publication is being launched to support the HOPE marine conference on 3-4 March, 2014. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director said: \"The rich life in Europe's seas is an incredible asset. But we must ensure that this asset is used in a sustainable way, without surpassing the limits of what the ecosystems can provide. The current way we use the sea risks irreversibly degrading many of these ecosystems.\" Approximately two fifths of the EU's population \u2013206 million people \u2013 live in a coastal area, and 23 of 28 Member States have a coastline. According to analysis from the European Commission, also published today, Member States must make urgent efforts and improve cooperation for the marine environment to reach good status by 2020, a target under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Europe's marine ecosystems threatened by multiple pressures Marine ecosystems are in a poor state of health in many areas, the EEA briefing says.\u00a0 There are more than 36 000 known animal and plant species in the European seas. Species surveys have found that 'good environmental status' can be applied to less than a fifth of species and a similar proportion of habitats. \u00a0 Different seas face different problems. Eutrophication is leading to oxygen-free 'dead zones' in the Baltic and Black Seas, while trawling has been most destructive of the seabed in the North Sea. The Mediterranean is under pressure from a range of factors, many of them related to fishing and tourism. In the last 25 years, sea surface temperatures have increased approximately 10 times faster than in other similar periods during the previous century or beyond. These climatic changes are pushing many organisms northwards \u2013 for example some types of plankton appear to have moved 1 100km. However, it is not a single issue but the cumulative effect of different pressures which is most important, the briefing notes. And many of these pressures are connected. For example, higher temperatures also increase oxygen depletion, affecting marine life, while increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere are acidifying the oceans, making it difficult for some animals to form shells. Together these changes may be disrupting whole ecosystems. Nonetheless, there are also some encouraging signs. For instance, the available data shows some fish stocks climbing back to safe biological limits, and nutrient loads have been reduced in the Baltic and North East Atlantic. Europe is also making progress in designating marine protected area networks, which currently cover 6 % of European seas. Looking ahead To see real improvement in our marine environment, the briefing recommends a two-fold approach. Firstly, Member States need to implement the MSFD in a more consistent and coherent manner that allows progress towards good environmental status to be monitored across regions. But seen over the longer perspective, reducing environmental pressures will require us to shift our economies and our values to a more sustainable ways of living, producing and consuming, the briefing notes. Such a transition is an ambitious goal, but it is necessary to fulfil the vision of 'living well within the limits of our planet' contained in the 7th Environmental Action Programme which sets out Europe's environmental policy priorities.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/marine-messages-briefing"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0336", "date": "2014-01-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Bat populations recovering, according to largest ever European study", "text": "It is extremely encouraging to see bat populations increasing after massive historic declines. It suggests that targeted conservation policies over the last years have been successful. But many bat species are still endangered, so preserving their habitats is still an important priority. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The EEA report on bats is the most comprehensive study yet made of European bat population trends, studying 16 of the 45 bat species found across the continent. The study is the first to compile data from ten existing monitoring schemes in nine countries, building a prototype European-scale indicator of bat population trends. Surveyors counted and catalogued bats hibernating at 6 000 sites in nine different countries. Overall these species appear to have increased by 43 % at hibernation sites between 1993 and 2011, with a relatively stable trend since 2003. \u201cIt is extremely encouraging to see bat populations increasing after massive historic declines,\u201d EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx said. \u201cIt suggests that targeted conservation policies over the last years have been successful. But many bat species are still endangered, so preserving their habitats is still an important priority. Monitoring bats also helps understand changes in wider ecosystems, including climate change, as they are highly sensitive to environmental change.\u201d European bat populations had previously declined significantly, particularly during the second half of the 20th century, largely due to intensifying agriculture, changes in land use, intentional killing and destruction of roosts. Bat numbers have also fallen as their habitats have shrunk, fragmented and degraded. Additionally, they have been poisoned by timber\u2011treatment toxic chemicals such as dieldrin, used in roofs. Bats tend to be long\u2011lived animals with a slow rate of reproduction, so environmental or human pressures can cause populations to decline very rapidly, and they tend to recover slowly. For these reasons bats should still be considered vulnerable, the report notes.\u00a0 While signs of increase are positive, conservationists consider that current populations are still likely to be smaller than they were before they declined. The report brings together for the first time data from, Latvia, Hungary, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, the United Kingdom and the German states Bavaria and Thuringia. The prototype indicator should be interpreted cautiously at this stage, as many species and countries are yet to be represented. It is hoped that this report will lay the groundwork for an even more comprehensive study in coming years, as bats are widely monitored across Europe. Most of the species studied seem to be increasing or stable in number. Eight bat species increased moderately, including Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii). The Whiskered bat and Brandt\u2019s bat (Myotis mystacinus / brandtii) are so difficult to tell apart that they are counted together.\u00a0 These were the only species to register a strong increase in numbers between 1993 and 2011, according to the survey. Three were stable, two species were uncertain and only the Grey long-eared bat (Plecotus austriacus) declined, albeit moderately. Nonetheless, many of these species are still rare and vulnerable. The report states that the apparent population increase of most species may reflect the impact of national and European conservation legislation, species and site protection, targeted conservation measures and widespread awareness\u2011raising, particularly under the EUROBATS agreement. Europe\u2019s wildlife is under pressure in many parts of Europe - only 17 % of habitats and 17 % of more than 1 000 animal and plant species assessed under the Habitats Directive (Art.17) have favourable conservation status. The Bat Conservation Trust (BCT), the Dutch Mammal Society (DMS) and Statistics Netherlands (SN) were key members of the project team behind the EEA report. Other organisations that contributed data and helped to develop the indicator included national bat and nature conservation NGOs, governmental organisations and individuals. \u00a0In addition, thousands of volunteer surveyors helped collect the data used. The EEA report on bats uses a similar methodology to a recent report detailing the dramatic decline of grassland butterflies in Europe. Numbers of these insects almost halved between 1990 and 2011 due to intensifying agriculture and a failure to properly manage grassland ecosystems, the report found.

Black carbon is one of the pollutants affecting both human health and the climate, but monitoring remains patchy. In 2011, several EU Member States breached legal limits for air pollution, mostly for nitrogen oxides (NOx). Traffic is one of the main sources of NOx. A growing body of scientific evidence suggests air pollution is more harmful than previously thought. This was reinforced by a statement in October from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which classified air pollution as carcinogenic.

Manufacturers\u2019 performance in meeting their targets is assessed on the basis of new vehicle registration data from Member States. By 2020 van manufacturers will have to further reduce emissions, so the average van sold in the EU emits 147 g CO2/km. This target was confirmed by the European Parliament and the Council earlier this year. People in Malta, Cyprus and Portugal bought vans with the lowest average emissions, the data shows, while at the other end of the scale vans sold in Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Germany had the highest. Vans CO2 emissions per country Data quality Twenty-eight manufacturers (of 66) provided feedback to the Commission and the EEA on the quality of the Member States' data. The verification covered approximately 60 % of the newly registered vehicles reported by Member States and showed good results for some vehicle categories.

Authors of the EEA report hope that the study will encourage more comprehensive monitoring of this pollutant, which is currently patchy. Health and climate effects Black carbon is the sooty part of particulate matter (PM) formed by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. It is mostly emitted by vehicles, non-road mobile machinery such as forestry machines, ships, coal or wood burning stoves in homes. Another important source is open biomass burning including forest fires and agricultural waste burning. Of all air pollutants, PM is the most harmful to health in Europe. The black carbon part of PM is particularly harmful as it represents a mixture of very fine, partly carcinogenic particles, small enough to enter the bloodstream and reach other organs. There is currently a lively debate about whether reducing this pollutant could have significant gains in reducing climate change, with a recent study suggesting that black carbon\u2019s effect on the climate is more potent than previously thought.

Global economic growth is projected to continue in coming decades, according to 'Continued economic growth?'. Emerging Asian economies are expected to play an ever larger role, with India and China together accounting for almost half of global output in 2050. The environmental and political implications of these changes will be significant. As described in 'From a unipolar to a multipolar world', markets are becoming ever more integrated. Partly as a result of these changes, the global middle class population (associated with high per capita consumption levels) is expected to grow very rapidly \u2014 from 27 % of 6.8 billion people today to almost 60 % of 8.4 billion people in 2030. The trends are likely to augment unprecedented levels of resource extraction, according to 'Intensified global competition for resources'. This has implications for Europe, which is heavily reliant on the imports of many materials, including more than half of its supply of metal ores, metal products, and fossil energy. Commodity prices more than doubled in real terms between 2000 and 2012, suggesting global resource demand is outpacing supply. Future projections are uncertain, however. Energy may be in particularly high demand in coming decades. For example, South Korea's per capita oil consumption increased more than 25-fold as it rapidly transformed into an advanced economy in the last half century. If Brazil, China, India and Indonesia were to replicate this pattern of development with their much larger populations, global energy demand would be dramatically affected, the assessment says. However, it does point to some positive trends in some advanced economies, where GDP has continued to increase while energy demand has stabilised, albeit at high levels. Many new technologies require critical raw materials \u2013 for example wind turbines, photovoltaic cells and electric car batteries all require some of the 14 raw materials listed as critical by the European Commission. Reserves of such materials are often concentrated in a few countries, the assessment says, increasing the uncertainty of future supplies and potentially constraining Europe's transition to a low carbon economy. Pressures on ecosystems are also likely to intensify over the coming years \u2013 something explored in 'Growing demands on ecosystems'. For example, increasing wealth and growing populations are likely to boost meat demand, which is likely to intensify global competition for scarce land resources. This is reflected in a dramatically increasing number of large-scale transnational acquisitions of land during recent years, mostly in developing countries. Bioenergy production is also set to grow over the coming years. Both trends may mean forests and other habitats are converted to farmland. Climate change is putting pressure on ecosystems, the assessment notes. There is a risk that thresholds may be passed, leading to systemic change. For example, rising temperatures could cause the Amazon basin to dry out, eventually causing the forest to die back to a savannah-like habitat. Nonetheless, the assessments present several positive opportunities for the future. Although Europe's global influence may be shrinking in some areas, increasing integration means that environmental policies pioneered in the EU may also be taken up worldwide, the assessment says, citing the example of EU vehicle emissions standards which have been rapidly adopted in many Asian countries. Background Today's updates, addressing increasing global demand for resources, follow the publication in September of two chapters addressing global economic growth. A further seven chapters will be published in coming months. The European environment's status, trends and prospects have always depended in part on events outside its borders. Moreover, the growing importance of global networks and flows has augmented this interdependence. The 11 global megatrends assessments will cover topics within the areas of society, environment, technology, economy, and governance. In 2014 the chapters will be consolidated into a single EEA report and will provide the basis for the analysis of megatrends included in the EEA's next assessment of the European environment's state and outlook, 'SOER 2015'.

City life does not have to mean polluted air, congestion, noise and long travelling times. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director Changing transport in cities is just one story in the 2013 edition of the annual Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism (TERM) published by the European Environment Agency (EEA), which presents a comprehensive analysis of transport's effect on the environment in the European Union. Urban transport has a marked effect on quality of life for the three quarters of Europeans living in cities. Road transport is a major source of air pollution in cities, leading to a high proportion of the population being exposed to pollutant levels above EU and World Health Organisation standards. The seriousness of this was underlined in October when the UN classified outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic. Traffic noise is also a major health issue in many cities. More than a quarter of the inhabitants of Sofia, Luxembourg, Paris and Tallinn are exposed to night-time traffic noise above WHO limits, according to data on 17 European capitals published in the report. Quality of life is also affected by commute times, with commuters in London and Budapest are most likely to travel more than an hour to work, according to a survey of 75 cities in the EU and Turkey. Many cities have successfully improved the urban environment by addressing two sides of the issue - encouraging people to switch to non-motorised modes and public transport, while simultaneously restricting car use. Despite initial opposition, such schemes often become very popular with residents, the report notes, citing the example of Stockholm's congestion charge. The report argues that such positive examples should encourage municipalities to replicate policies elsewhere. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \"Many cities are applying innovative ideas which will make the car-based transport system seem like an idea belonging to the last century. City life does not have to mean polluted air, congestion, noise and long travelling times. New ideas in urban transport are transforming many cities into more pleasant, healthy places to live.\" Better cycling infrastructure in many cities is starting a self-reinforcing pattern of increasing bike traffic, the report notes, referring to the Copenhagenize Index of bicycle-friendly cities. For example, Seville recently moved rapidly up to fourth place due to the extensive new infrastructure for bikes, which has allowed bike traffic to increase from 0.5 % of kilometres travelled to 7 % in just a few years. \u00a0 Europeans flying more, limiting transport emissions reductions The EEA's TERM report also includes many other indicators measuring environmental trends connected to transport. In the EU, greenhouse gas emissions from transport fell slightly (0.6 %[i]) between 2010 and 2011. However, deeper year-on-year cuts will be necessary to meet the target of cutting emissions by 60 % of 1990 levels by 2050, the report shows, as current transport emissions are actually 25 % above 1990 levels. Emissions reductions were limited by rising aviation emissions, which went up 2.6 % between 2010 and 2011. This increase follows the more general trend in air passenger demand, which grew by two thirds between 1995 and 2009. Overall, Europeans are travelling more than ever before. While plane travel reached an all-time high in 2011, car passenger transport decreased slightly, according to the report. New cars have become more efficient in line with EU legislation, the report shows, suggesting that many manufacturers will meet their 2015 target for average new car fleet efficiency ahead of time. However, there are some differences between real-world driving emissions and the emissions recorded in the test cycle, the report states, so a new international standard test may soon be introduced to resolve some of these issues. Renewable energy in transport is not increasing as fast as it should do \u2013Member States have agreed to increase renewable sources to make up 10 % of energy consumed in transport, but in 2011 levels were below the necessary 'target path' at a 3.8 % average of all EU Member States. Most of this energy comes from biofuels, which must meet sustainability criteria to be counted.

But in many areas, its resources are at risk because short-term gains have been prioritised over longer-term sustainable management. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director 'Balancing the future of Europe's coasts', a new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA), argues that Europe needs to improve its knowledge to better understand the long-term damaging effects of current human and economic pressures on the coastal environment, jeopardizing the essential maintenance of the natural capital. Coastal regions generate around 40 % of EU GDP. Europe is a major player in many intensive maritime industries, including shipping and ports, fisheries, energy and coastal tourism. However, this has come at a cost - habitat destruction, overfishing, pollution, coastal erosion, and infrastructure development have damaged coastal ecosystems. Moreover, climate change is likely to make these regions \u2013 and the societies in them \u2013 more vulnerable, the report says. Seas and coasts are currently considered to be drivers for the European economy with great potential for innovation and growth. Approximately 40 % of the EU population lives within 50 km of the sea, and this is growing \u2013 in some parts of the Mediterranean coast in Spain and France, the population has increased by up to 50 % between 2001 and 2011. Growing demand for living space and other needs means that impervious areas such as concrete increased by 5 % between 2006 and 2009, the report says, further breaking up coastal habitats. This expansion was fastest in coastal areas in Cyprus, Norway, Malta and Spain, where areas with sealed soils increased by more than 10 %. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \"Europe's coastline is vital for its economy. But in many areas, its resources are at risk because short-term gains have been prioritised over longer-term sustainable management. For example, some endangered coastal habitats act as natural protection from storm surges. One thing that can help safeguard these habitats is better data and knowledge, particularly as there is a pressing need to adapt to the effects of climate change.\" Multiple pressures on coastal ecosystems Habitats are disappearing or being broken up at an accelerating rate, the report says, leading to an alarming decline of 'ecosystem services'. One example of an ecosystem service is the seagrass Posidonia oceania, which traps millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, helps prevent erosion and is home to hundreds of sea creatures. This habitat has been declining by 5 % a year in the Mediterranean, making it increasingly endangered. Many European coastal and transitional water bodies do not achieve high or good quality status. The worst situation is reported from the Baltic Sea, followed by the North Sea and the Black Sea. In coastal waters in the Mediterranean and the open Atlantic coast the situation is better. Only 10 % of marine habitats were found to have a 'favourable' status, and just 3 % of marine species had a favourable conservation status. The status of many species was unknown, but research has confirmed that the status of at least 50 % of fish species is unfavourable. For example, cod stocks in the Kattegat at the entrance to the Baltic have declined to approximately 6 % of 1971 levels. There were nine major oil spills in European waters between 1998 and 2009, and many smaller accidents. Despite a declining number of oil spills, larger volumes of crude oil or oil products are increasingly transported by ship, which poses a significant risk. An increasing amount of litter in the sea is directly harming marine organisms when they eat pieces of rubbish, or become tangled in it. This can also affect human health when plastics ingested by marine organisms enter the food chain. In 2002 the European Union recommended Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) to bring together different stakeholders and decision-makers for a more long-term view. Although ICZM principles are increasingly being adopted in the management of coastal areas, progress has not been uniform. Ten years after the recommendation, the European Commission estimated that implementation of ICZM was only about 50 % across the EU as a whole. Better management of Europe's coastline If coastal regions are to continue to power European economies, provide ecosystems services, and remain home to millions of people, they must be managed more cohesively, the report says. This management must also be based on integrated policy, aiming to balance competing interests of human development, while ensuring healthy and resilient coastal ecosystems that much of this development relies on. The European Commission has recently proposed a framework for integrated coastal management and for 'maritime spatial planning', to better manage competing claims and resources at sea. Within this framework, plans and strategies will require high quality data to measure the health of the coastal environment. Improving the knowledge base The lack of quality\u2011assured spatial data hinders effective management, so EU Member States need to make more effort to harmonise their data and make it consistent with the data reported by other countries, the report says. When coastal data is shared across borders and enhanced by coordinated indicator sets, it can give a larger and more refined picture of the wider ecosystem issues, making it easier to implement an ecosystem\u2011based management approach.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/the-squeeze-on-europe2019s-coastline-continues"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0346", "date": "2013-11-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Competing demands on Europe's environment undermining human well-being", "text": "We can see that the European environment is currently under pressure in many areas, and incremental improvements will not be enough to put Europe on the path to a green economy. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The EEA's Environmental indicator report 2013\u00a0explores the implications of a transition to a 'green economy', defined as an economic system which uses \u00a0resources more efficiently, enhances human well-being and maintains natural systems. The report aims to support implementation of the European Union's 7th Environmental Action Programme (7th EAP), due to be officially signed by policymakers today, which sets the long-term objectives of environmental policymaking in the EU. Entitled 'Living well, within the limits of our planet', it puts a particular focus on ensuring a healthy environment for human well-being. Europeans depend on the environment to provide for many aspects of their material well-being, according to the report. Environmental pressures associated with our lifestyles seem to be decreasing, at least within Europe's borders. However, seen through the lens of resource use and well-being, European consumption is still unsustainable, particularly in the context of growing resource demands globally. Policies should be closer integrated to reconcile competing demands on nature and to maximise benefits to society. \u201cTo maintain a high standard of living in Europe, we will need to make a more fundamental transition to an economic model which meets our needs at much lower environmental cost,\u201d Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said. \u201cWe can see that the European environment is currently under pressure in many areas, and incremental improvements will not be enough to put Europe on the path to a green economy.\u201d Selected findings Within Europe, environmental pressures from resource use appear to be declining, most notably for water and energy. However, large regional differences exist. \u00a0Urban sprawl, bioenergy and food production all compete for finite land resources and put pressure on biodiversity and water systems. Human exposure to these combined pressures is very unevenly distributed, with some areas and societal groups being much more affected than others. Spatial planning \u00a0plays a key role in addressing these pressures in an integrated manner, the report says. Regarding food, EU farmland area declined by 13 % between 1961 and 2011. This was more than offset by a 259 % increase in productivity, achieved by rationalising production methods and increasing fertiliser and pesticide use. While this intensive production enables \u00a0the EU \u00a0to be \u00a0largely self-sufficient for main \u00a0commodities and products \u00a0such as meat, dairy, cereals and beverages, it has resulted in a range of environmental problems, including eutrophication, greenhouse gas emissions, and air and water pollution. Reducing these pressures would require reduced external chemical inputs, water and energy use, land take and waste generation. Common Agricultural Policy subsidies and other measures could better incentivise more ecologically sustainable farming methods. Water abstraction has declined since 1990, indicating increased water efficiency. However, many parts of Europe are still water stressed, with Cyprus, Belgium, Italy, Malta and Spain particularly affected. Pollution is another pressure on water resources. Despite the reduction of some pollutants, less than half of Europe's surface waters are reported to have good ecological status. 'Emerging contaminants' in water are also a growing area of concern for human wellbeing, the report says. These pollutants come from chemicals found in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and other products, and their harmful nature is only now starting to become apparent. EU energy consumption has remained stable in the last two decades despite a 50 % increase in economic output, according to the report. Fossil fuels dominate the EU energy mix, accounting for between 96 % (Cyprus) and 37\u00a0% (Sweden) of national energy consumption. Air pollution and climate change associated with the use of fossil fuels mean that they are the energy source with the highest indirect health and well-being impacts. Burning biomass for home heating increased 56 % between 1990 and 2011, raising serious concerns for health. The lack of filters on domestic burners means that households are now the main source of fine particulate matter emissions in the EU. Regarding housing, diffuse urban sprawl and decreasing average household size mean that the efficiency of housing is declining in Europe, in terms of both land and energy use. Between 1990 and 2006, residential areas grew almost four times as fast as the European population, contributing to the fragmentation of natural habitats. The report points to serious failings in European efforts to meet resource needs. For example, approximately 14 % of the EU population cannot afford to keep their homes warm. This rate is up to 40 % in some countries. The report draws on some of the EEA's 146 environmental indicators, which evaluate a huge range of different environmental issues. In early 2015, the EEA will publish its State of the Environment Report (SOER), a comprehensive Europe-wide environmental assessment published every five years. The SOER is also based on a broad range of environmental indicators. \u00a0 Presentation Natural resources and human well-being in a green economy - EEA environmental indicator report 2013 from European Environment Agency (EEA)", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/competing-demands-on-europe2019s-environment"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0347", "date": "2013-11-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU satellite data to be freely available", "text": "Copernicus already gathers and processes data from satellites.

It is hoped that the freely available data will help further environmental understanding, allowing businesses, researchers, citizens and policy makers to integrate greater environmental knowledge into everything they do. The European Environment Agency (EEA) plays a key role in Copernicus, coordinating in-situ observations and contributing to the development of services, with a particular focus on the technical coordination of the Land Monitoring Service. The data is useful for many different users. For example, on 8 November the Copernicus Emergency Management service produced the first damage assessment maps for the Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, helping relief efforts. Other environment-related services from Copernicus monitor Europe\u2019s land, its oceans, its atmosphere and climate change. Satellites: a vital tool in modern environmental management Satellite measurements have improved environmental monitoring, allowing more evidence based policy and ultimately better environmental management. In the past, most observations were made at ground level and interpolated to build up an overview . Often, this overview was inconsistent and showed different things depending on how and when each country carried out its monitoring. In contrast, satellites give a broad view of a subject at a particular time, providing a comparable and instantaneous view of large areas, even the whole globe. They are also systematic \u2013 the Sentinels will pass over the same points on a regular basis, allowing for monitoring of developments over time. As such, they provide data across Europe and beyond as part of a global monitoring framework. Satellite observations allow policy makers to see how cities are growing \u2013 for example, the Urban Atlas has been used to map access to public transport. Other important uses include monitoring air pollution and the extent of important ecosystems, while current scientific understanding of the melting Arctic ice cap has only been possible with satellite observations.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/eu-satellite-data-to-be"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0348", "date": "2013-11-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Campaigning for the use of low-noise tyres", "text": "Noise can increase stress levels or disturb sleep, affecting human health. Prolonged exposure can even trigger serious illnesses such as hypertension and heart disease. At least 110 million Europeans are exposed to damaging levels of noise just from road traffic, according to a recent EEA estimate based on data from its member countries. Considering this widespread impact, the EEA aims to raise awareness on the importance of healthy soundscapes with the European Soundscape Award which this year is presented at the Gouden Decibel Award Ceremony. The award recognises initiatives that can help reduce noise and create more tranquil environments. In 2013, 11 entries were submitted covering a wide range of initiatives in the field of noise control or soundscape management. More information on each project is available in this map. View Larger Map The winner of the European Soundscape Award 2013 A Swiss consortium of public and private partners led by The Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) won the European Soundscape Award 2013 for their communication campaign. The idea behind the campaign was to help reduce road traffic noise promoting the use of low-noise tyres. The campaign focused on the frequently-overlooked option of choosing quieter tyres. Low-noise tyres are already on the market, are not more expensive than regular tyres and do not show obvious trade-offs in other areas such as durability. A database of tyres was developed to enable car owners to compare the rolling noise of different products. Other parameters are also important - for example rolling resistance influences fuel consumption and wet grip has an effect on safety. So the focus of the campaign was expanded to promote \u201cbetter tyres\u201d that were both quiet, fuel saving and safe. Alongside the database, the campaign used a range of promotional measures including a campaign website, TV advertising, online-ads, billboard advertising, posters and flyers for car repair shops, a Twitter campaign and a lottery giving away prizes of quality tyres. The campaign was communicated in German, French and Italian. A telephone survey showed that there was widespread awareness of the campaign. European Soundscape Award 2013 - runner-up prize The project \u2018Cultivating Urban Sound\u2019, presenting the importance of sound for quality of life in urban areas, won the runner-up prize. The project has two parts. The first part is a master thesis \u2019Cultivating Urban Sound \u2013 Unknown Potentials for Urbanism\u2019 by Trond Maag from Oslo School of Architecture and Design, exploring opportunities for planning and designing urban sound. It concludes that private and public players should be made aware of their responsibility for the acoustic environment, in order for European city soundscapes to become more attractive. To this end, it recommends fostering a \u2018sound culture\u2019 within municipalities to encourage planners, architects and other stakeholders to think about sound using a multidisciplinary approach. In the second part of the project, Maag continues his work researching the acoustic features of typical urban and suburban areas in Switzerland. He has subsequently produced a guide for designers and planners which can be used to improve urban soundscapes. The second part of this project also involved FOEN, alongside the Building Department of the Canton of Zurich. European efforts to reduce noise The Environmental Noise Directive (2002/49/EC) is one of the main instruments to identify noise pollution levels and to trigger the necessary action both at Member State and at EU level. The EEA supports noise reduction across Europe by compiling noise data from EEA member countries and making them available through the Noise Observation and Information Service for Europe (NOISE) database. The data can be viewed in a user-friendly interactive map or can be downloaded in a variety of formats. The EEA has also published a Good Practice Guide on noise exposure and potential health effects which can help national, regional and local authorities to prepare action plans.

Carmakers' rate of progress suggests that future objectives are certainly attainable. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director Car registration data has been analysed by the EEA in the report 'CO2 emissions performance of car manufacturers in 2012'. Based on emission levels recorded in vehicle tests, the report shows that in 2012 all major car manufacturers have met their targets for their fleet. Some were already in line with more stringent 2015 targets. Carbon emissions of the average car sold in the EU fell 2.6 % between 2011 and 2012, cutting the EU average to 132.2 grams of CO2 per kilometre (g CO2/km). This is close to the 130 g target for the average new car sold in 2015. Each manufacturer has a different target, based on the average mass of their fleet, which is gradually phased in, meaning that in 2012 only 65 % of each manufacturer's fleet needed to meet the target, increasing to 100 % of cars in 2015. By 2020, current legislation states that the average car sold in the EU must not emit more than 95 g CO2/km. \"The average car sold in the EU is now over 20 % more efficient than a decade ago, which is clearly good news,\" EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx said. \"Carmakers' rate of progress suggests that future objectives are certainly attainable. At the same time, however, the EEA looks towards a future transition of the mobility system beyond making efficiency gains in internal combustion engine technology.\" Chart:\u00a0Distance to 2012 target by individual manufacturers Data source Key findings Average emissions of new cars sold in Europe in 2012 were 132.2 g CO2/km, which is 2.6 % lower than the previous year. The report defines 'large manufacturers' as the 20 companies selling more than 100 000 cars in 2012. Cars sold by these companies made up 94.5% of the total fleet, and emitted 130.4 g CO2/km on average,\u00a0 which is 1.8 g lower than the European fleet average. Of the large manufacturers, Fiat had the lowest average emissions (117 g CO2/km). Renault, Peugeot, Toyota and Citroen also had emissions well below the average. At the other end of the scale, Daimler cars emitted 143 g CO2/km on average, with similar emissions levels from cars made by Volvo, Mazda and GM Korea. Compared to 2011, Daimler and Volvo decreased their emission by more than 9 g CO2/km. More than 10 % of the vehicles sold by Toyota and Renault emitted less than 95 g CO2/km. Manufacturers may meet their targets either individually or as part of a pool of carmakers. Of the manufacturers that missed their individual targets, some were able to meet targets through pooling. When derogations and pools are considered, 74 manufacturers out of 85 met 2012 targets. Nine of the larger manufacturers were already compliant with 2015 targets in 2012. Although so-called 'super credits' give carmakers an advantage for selling electric vehicles or cars with very low emissions, these credits did not influence whether large manufacturers met their targets, the report shows. These credits will be phased out between 2012 and 2016. Despite emissions reductions between 2011 and 2012, the average weight of cars increased to 1 402 kg, the heaviest in the last three years. There were seven manufacturers selling only electric vehicles in the EU in 2012, according to the report. Larger manufacturers are also involved \u2013 in total 20 manufacturers sold electric models in the EU in 2012.

To get on to a sustainable path, Europe will have to be ambitious and go beyond current legislation. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The report, 'Air quality in Europe \u2013 2013 report', is an EEA contribution to the European Commission's review of air quality policy and the EU 'Year of Air'. Vehicles, industry, agriculture and homes are contributing to air pollution in Europe. Despite falling emission levels and reductions of some air pollutant concentrations in recent decades, the report demonstrates that Europe's air pollution problem is far from solved. Two specific pollutants, particulate matter and ground-level ozone, continue to be a source breathing problems, cardiovascular disease and shortened lives. New scientific findings show that human health can be harmed by lower concentrations of air pollution than previously thought. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cAir pollution is causing damage to human health and ecosystems. Large parts of the population do not live in a healthy environment, according to current standards. To get on to a sustainable path, Europe will have to be ambitious and go beyond current legislation.\u201d Environment Commissioner Janez Poto\u010dnik added: \u201cAir quality is a central concern for many people. Surveys show that a large majority of citizens understand well the impact of air quality on health and are asking public authorities to take action at EU, national and local levels, even in times of austerity and hardship. I am ready to respond to these concerns through the Commission's upcoming Air Policy Review.\u201d Between 2009 and 2011, up to 96 % of city dwellers were exposed to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations above WHO guidelines and up to 98 % were exposed to ozone (O3) levels above WHO guidelines. Lower proportions of EU citizens were exposed to levels of these pollutants exceeding the limits or targets set out in EU legislation. These EU limits or targets are in certain cases less strict than WHO guidelines. See EEA data on EU exposure in 2011. It is not just cities - some rural areas also have significant levels of air pollution, the report notes. National differences across Europe are presented in a series of country fact-sheets accompanying the main findings. There have been several success stories in cutting emissions of air pollutants \u2013 for example sulphur dioxide emissions from power plants, industry and transport have been reduced over the last decade, reducing exposure. Phasing out leaded petrol has also reduced concentrations of lead, found to affect neurological development. Eutrophication Alongside health concerns, the report also highlights environmental problems such as eutrophication, which is when excessive nutrient nitrogen damages ecosystems, threatening biodiversity. Eutrophication is still a widespread problem that affects most European ecosystems. Emissions of some nitrogen-containing pollutants have decreased, for example emissions of nitrogen oxides and ammonia have fallen by 27 % and 7 % respectively since 2002. However, emissions were not reduced as much as anticipated, with eight EU Member States breaching legal ceilings a year after the deadline for compliance. To address eutrophication, further measures are needed to reduce emissions of nitrogen. Listen EEA Executive Director Hans Bruninckx explain the report.

Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director EEA's report 'Trends and projections in Europe 2013'\u00a0considers EU progress in meeting greenhouse gas emission reduction, renewable energy and energy efficiency targets. The European Union reduced emissions between 1990 and 2012 by approximately 18 % - so it is already close to the target of 20 % emissions reduction by 2020. The EU was also on track towards its common target for renewable energy consumption \u2013 renewables contributed 13 % of final energy consumption in 2011, which should increase to 20% by 2020. The collective primary energy consumption of the EU is expected to decrease towards the political objective by 2020, although more policies are needed at Member State level. While the assessment of Member State progress shows overall relatively good progress towards climate and energy targets, no single Member State is on track towards meeting all three targets. Equally, no Member State is underperforming in all three areas. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \"EEA's latest analysis confirms that renewable energy and energy efficiency are having a significant effect on bringing down emissions. We must keep building on this success - to achieve the emissions cuts demanded by science, Member States must ensure that they are not making choices today that become obstacles to a low carbon future.\" First overall picture of Kyoto Protocol period 2008-2012 Emissions fell almost 1 % in 2012, according to approximate 2012 greenhouse gas emissions data published recently. The EEA report released today also builds on these figures, providing for the first time a complete picture of emission reductions achieved under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008\u20132012). The 15 Member States with a common commitment under the Kyoto Protocol (EU-15) are estimated to have reduced emissions between 2008 and 2012 by 12.2 %, well beyond the 8\u00a0% target required under the Kyoto Protocol. Moreover, almost all European countries with an individual greenhouse gas reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol (26 Member States of the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) were on track towards their respective targets. Two EU Member States do not have an individual target for 2008\u20132012. The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) supported many Member States in achieving Kyoto targets. When targets were agreed for ETS and non-ETS sectors, some countries put more emphasis on achieving emission reductions in economic sectors that are not part of the ETS, such as road transport and households. The EEA finds that these countries need to acquire relatively large quantities of Kyoto emission credits to reach their individual targets. This concerns in particular Austria, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Spain. More country-specific information is available in a series of national profiles.

In the future, it will likely be supported by a stronger EU policy limiting the use of F-gases with high global warming potentials. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director There are three main categories of F-gases - hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Their global warming potential (GWP) varies widely, but can be very high - a single tonne of SF6 has the same global warming potential as almost 24 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2). This means quantities of F-gases are expressed in two different ways: in metric tonnes, and also in global warming potential (GWP) weighted tonnes, or CO2 equivalent tonnes. Such units take into account the gases\u2019 overall effect on the climate. Some F-gases are used as replacements for ozone-depleting substances, which are largely being phased out in the EU in compliance with the Montreal Protocol and EU legislation. This means that F-gas use is increasing in a number of applications. F-gases accounted for approximately 2 % of EU overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 (CO2 equivalent), and this share continues to increase. While emissions of all other main groups of greenhouse gases reduced significantly between 1990 and 2011, F-gases emissions have increased more than 50 % over this period, when measured in CO2 equivalent. To control these gases, the European Commission proposed a new F-Gas Regulation in 2012, which aims to cut current F-gas levels by two thirds by 2030. The proposed policy maintains many features of the current legislation, and would also progressively phase down sales of some gases on the EU market while simultaneously banning F-gases with a high GWP. This proposal is still being negotiated by the European Parliament and Council. Under the current F-Gas Regulation, Member States must improve the leak-tightness of equipment containing F-gases, and avoid using them when there are environmentally-superior alternatives. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cReducing F-gases\u2019 effect on the climate requires an innovative approach from industry. In the future, it will likely be supported by a stronger EU policy limiting the use of F-gases with high global warming potentials.\u201d Current trends Companies producing, importing or exporting more than one tonne of F-gases must report quantities to the European Commission. The overall quantities, reported by 129 companies, are published today by the EEA, \u2018Fluorinated Greenhouse Gases 2012\u2019. Volumes of gases are given in both metric tonnes and CO2-equivalent. When expressed in terms of CO2-equivalent, exports of F-gases during the last two years were at their highest levels since reporting started in 2007, the report says. Imports of F-gases decreased by 10 % between 2011 and 2012, while the \u2018net supply[1]\u2019 of F-gases in 2012 shows little change from 2011. Of the net supply of F-gases in the EU, HFCs used in refrigeration and air conditioning account for 62 % (CO2 equivalent). Manufacturing electrical equipment sometimes uses SF6, and this accounted for 23 % of the net supply. The HFCs used in aerosols were responsible for 6 %. Other HFC uses include fire protection and foams. [1] 'Net supply' provides information on the actual use of (bulk) F-gases by EU industries. It is calculated by adding reported amounts for production, bulk imports, stocks held on 1 January of the reporting year and 'other amounts collected for reclamation or destruction from within the EU', and then subtracting reported amounts for bulk exports, destruction (on-site by reporting companies and off-site within the EU on reporting companies' behalf), amounts used as feedstock by reporting companies and stocks held on 31 December of the reporting year.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/use-of-climate-forcing-f"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0353", "date": "2013-09-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Water: Charging full cost can encourage more efficient use", "text": "The EEA study, 'Assessment of cost recovery through water pricing', considers water pricing in several EU countries: Croatia, England and Wales, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Scotland, Serbia, Slovenia and Spain. Water is under stress in many parts of Europe. Even in regions which usually experience a high level of rainfall, abstracting and cleaning water can have a high economic and environmental cost. This means that Europe needs to redouble efforts in using water more efficiently to avoid undermining its economy. Inefficient water use impacts hard on the resources needed by ecosystems and people. In response to these problems, the report states that water should be priced at a level which both encourages efficient use and properly reflects its cost. This should include all costs of purifying and transporting the water. In addition, environmental and resource costs of water use, such as pollution and the depletion of resources, should also be internalised into water prices, the report says. Such charges should factor in lost 'ecosystem services' which also require water, for example wetlands carry out valuable services such as water purification and flood prevention. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cIn many parts of Europe, profligate water use is a real problem. However, there is a lot of potential for Europe to cut water use by improving efficiency. Charging water users for the volume of water they actually use, at a price reflecting the true cost, sends an important signal \u2013 freshwater is a limited and precious resource.\u201d The EU Water Framework Directive called for Member States to create incentives for efficient water use by 2010. However, it is unclear whether this has in fact resulted in any change in national policies. Key findings Households use around a third less water when they are charged for the actual amount they use. However, flat-rate charging structures are still common in many countries, even though such tariffs are more expensive for most water users and do not incentivise efficient water use. Some water uses, such as drinking water, are not significantly influenced by changes in price. However, studies show that other uses are much more responsive, including water for gardening or swimming pools. The report lists some examples of water use responding to pricing. Urban water prices in Denmark increased by 54 % between 1993 and 2004 along with infrastructure investments. Over a decade water use per person per day fell by almost 20 % to 125 liters, one of the lowest levels of any OECD country. Water prices in the Czech Republic increased in real terms since 1990, resulting in a 40 % decrease in domestic water use. In most countries, farmers are also allowed to use unlimited water for a flat charge. Charging for the volume of water used reduces the amount of water used by agriculture by 10 -20 %, according to some studies. Switching to volumetric charging is most successful when combined with more modern irrigation technology and work to fix leaks, the report says. In most countries, household water tariffs are designed to recover the financial costs. In contrast, agricultural water use is often heavily subsidised, so the price covers as little as 20 % of costs in some cases. In Spain, where some regions are severely water-stressed, agricultural water prices recover less than half of the cost. This may encourage inefficient water use, the report says. When the price of using water does not recover the full cost, some of the cost may be inadvertently passed on to others. For example, if industry pollutes water and fails to pay for it to be cleaned, these costs are imposed on society. Low-income households must also have access to affordable water services, but keeping prices artificially low for all users is not the best method, the report says, as it may lead to a vicious cycle of underfunded service providers with poor infrastructure. The public seems to support being charged according to the volume of water they use \u2013 84 % of EU citizens agree with this principle to some extent, according to a 2012 Eurobarometer survey.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/water-charging-full-cost-can"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0354", "date": "2013-09-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "IPCC report provides new evidence of climate change", "text": "The Working Group\u00a0I contribution to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) looks at the most recent physical science of climate change.

Climate change is happening now and will continue over decades and centuries to come, the report states, finding that it is at least \u201c95 % certain\u201d that humans are the dominant cause. Action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases can limit the amount and pace of climate change, the report says.\u00a0 Without such mitigation action, global mean temperature would likely pass the internationally agreed limit of 2\u00a0oC above pre-industrial levels at some point this century, possibly before 2050. Climate change in Europe A recent report from the European Environment Agency found that climate change is already evident across Europe, affecting ecosystems as well as human activities. This implies that addressing climate change requires a two-handed approach, simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting societies to observed and projected changes. The European Union\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2011 were 18.4 % below 1990 levels, according to the latest official data. Europe is also reacting to experienced and projected climate change, with adaptation now an important policy area at the EU and national level. So far, 16 EEA member countries have developed national adaptation strategies. Adaptation plans have already led to concrete action in many countries as well as at the transnational, regional and local level. Such actions vary considerably, taking into account to address specific climate conditions as well as social and economic contexts.

The river runs through Switzerland, France, Germany, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Austria, Liechtenstein, Belgium and Italy. The International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine (ICPR), the countries and local authorities in the basin have dramatically improved the water quality of the Rhine with better management of urban wastewater. In addition, a large area of floodplains has been restored in the densely populated Rhine basin over the last 15 years, thanks to new integrated policies. The International River Foundation award was presented in Vienna on Thursday 12 September. An expert from the European Environment Agency (EEA) participated in the Judging Panel, alongside other experts from across Europe. The panel selected the Rhine as the winner as they were able to clearly demonstrate leadership, sophistication and an integrated, complex approach to river basin management. They also recognised that the Rhine had overcome a range of challenges and achieved real on-ground improvements in river and species health. Rivers under pressure The IRF Award process highlights the fact that human activities use a lot of water, depleting many rivers. For example, across the European Union, agriculture uses about a quarter of water diverted from the natural environment, though this can be up to 80% in southern Europe. This could be reduced by making irrigation more efficient, according to an EEA assessment published last year. While there has been some progress in reducing pollution from farming, pollution from such \u2018diffuse\u2019 sources remains a significant pressure in more than 40 % of Europe\u2019s river water bodies. Pollution also comes from \u2018point sources\u2019, such as discharges from wastewater treatment plants and industry. Wastewater from sewage systems often overflows during heavy rains. When the shape of rivers is changed, this affects the ecosystems living from the river \u2013 for example fish and other animals may not be able to migrate when there are dams and other barriers in the way. The EEA estimates there are several hundred thousand barriers in European rivers, in many of these water bodies their natural continuity is interrupted every second kilometre. Such \u2018hydromorphological pressures\u2019, together with pollution are two of the main pressures affecting ecological status in European rivers. Overall, the European Commission estimates that more than half (57 %) of the river water bodies in Europe have not yet achieved \u2018good ecological status\u2019, something which they are committed to by 2015 under the Water Framework Directive (WFD).", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/river-rhine-commended-for-river"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0356", "date": "2013-08-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Hot summer weather exacerbating ozone pollution", "text": "Ozone formation increases during warm sunny weather depending on the level of \u2018precursor pollutants\u2019 present. Europe must therefore work hard to reduce the emissions of pollutants that cause ozone to protect human health. Paul McAleavey, Head of EEA Air and Climate Change Programme Ozone pollution has serious effects on health, especially for older people and children, or those with asthma and other respiratory problems. Reducing ozone pollution in the air depends on cutting the \u2018precursor pollutants\u2019 which lead to ozone formation. When ozone levels in the air exceed certain thresholds \u2013 either the \u2018Information Threshold\u2019 or the higher \u2018Alert Threshold\u2019 \u2013 Member States must report such \u2018exceedances\u2019 to the European Commission, via the EEA, and inform their citizens. Paul McAleavey, Head of EEA Air and Climate Change Programme, said: \u2018Ozone formation increases during warm sunny weather depending on the level of \u2018precursor pollutants\u2019 present. Europe must therefore work hard to reduce the emissions of pollutants that cause ozone to protect human health\u2019. Ozone exceeding pollutant thresholds July this year has been hotter than usual with warmer than average temperatures across most of Central and Western Europe. In July 2013, the average temperatures in Rome, Prague, Paris and Copenhagen were among the highest since 1996. These temperatures may have contributed to increased ozone levels. Although April, May and June this year had fewer exceedances compared to the same period in 2012, the number of exceedances in July 2013 seems to be much higher than last year, according to preliminary data reported to EEA, showing that the Information Threshold for ozone was exceeded at approximately a quarter of all measurement sites in Europe. In the first half of July concentrations exceeding the Information Threshold occurred mainly in northern Italy, Spain and southern France, but by the second half of the month similarly high pollutant concentrations were also found in parts of northern Europe. Ozone exceeded these limits in the Paris area (17 July) and in the Netherlands, Belgium and western Germany (22 to 23 July). At the end of the month most of the exceedances were registered in northern Italy, with high values occasionally occurring also in the Central European region. Last summer levels of ozone were particularly low - the alert threshold was exceeded the fewest times since monitoring began in 1997. This is partly due to efforts to reduce air pollution in Europe. However, ozone is still a problem, with more than 98 % of the total EU urban population potentially exposed to ozone levels above World Health Organization guidelines to protect health. What causes ozone? Ground-level ozone is not directly emitted into the atmosphere but is formed from chemical reactions following the release of various \u2018precursor pollutants\u2019 from a wide variety of sources, \u00a0for example: fossil fuel combustion, road transport, refineries, solvents, vegetation, landfills, wastewater, livestock and forest fires. The reactions that create ozone are catalysed by heat and sunlight \u2013 so it is a particular problem in the summer months, and southern Europe typically has much higher levels of ozone than the north. Excessive ground-level ozone can cause respiratory problems, trigger asthma, reduce lung function and cause lung diseases. The mortality rate rises with increases in ozone exposure, according to several European studies. Unlike ozone in the stratosphere, which protects us from ultraviolet radiation, high levels of ground-level or \u2018tropospheric\u2019 ozone can also damage plants, reducing crop yields and forest growth, and also damage buildings and monuments. Staying safe from poor air quality Children, the elderly, asthma sufferers and others with respiratory illnesses are most vulnerable. If ozone levels are very high, it is advisable for these groups to avoid spending a lot of time outdoors. Ozone levels are usually higher in the afternoon, so vulnerable people may avoid the higher levels of pollution by working or exercising outdoors in the mornings or evenings. You can find up-to-date information on ground level ozone concentrations across the pan-European region at the EEA\u2019s real-time air quality maps. The site gives hourly ground level ozone concentrations for the current situation as well as recent episodes, based on up-to-date air quality data measurements. The website provides data from around 2 000 monitoring sites, allowing anyone to check air quality in a specific region or across Europe. Concentration data for other pollutants (PM10, NO2 and SO2) can also be found in this viewer. The EEA website also provides information on exceedances of the different ozone thresholds measured this summer (both calculated from the real-time data and from the data officially reported\u00a0by countries). Historical validated data from previous years is stored in Airbase. The EEA also publishes reports overviewing the ozone situation\u00a0in previous summer periods.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/hot-summer-weather-exacerbating-ozone-pollution"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0357", "date": "2013-08-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Marine litter \u2013 a growing threat worldwide", "text": "There are now vast patches of litter and smaller plastic particles funnelled together by ocean currents in all oceans. The patch in the Pacific is the size of Europe according to some estimates, while there is also a smaller but significant patch right on Europe\u2019s doorstep in the Atlantic. \u00a0Marine litter also accumulates in coastal areas, either on the sea bottom or on beaches when washed ashore. See the EEA's infographic on marine litter. World leaders increasingly recognise the scale of the problem, and at the 2012 Rio Earth Summit they committed to \u201ca significant reduction in marine litter by 2025\u201d. The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which aims for seas to reach \u2018good environmental status\u2019 by 2020, recognises marine litter as one of the main threats to the marine environment alongside fisheries, pollution, invasive alien species and noise. The European Environment Agency (EEA) will consider marine litter in its forthcoming assessment of the state of the marine environment, to be published in autumn 2014. Poisoning and \u2018ghost fishing\u2019 Fish, birds and other sea creatures also swallow pieces of litter which can eventually kill them \u2013 globally at least 43 % of cetacean species, all species of marine turtles, approximately 36 % of the world\u2019s seabird species and many species of fish have been reported to ingest marine litter. Animals can also become trapped in discarded nets or other rubbish. Around 10 % of the litter in the world\u2019s oceans is discarded fishing gear, which continues to catch fish \u2013 a phenomenon known as \u2018ghost fishing\u2019. Most of the litter in the sea is plastic, for example plastic bags, bottles, bottle caps and Styrofoam, mainly as a result of our current consumer habits where plastic packaging has increased dramatically. Part of the problem arises from the fact that these materials never biodegrade but are instead only partially degraded by sunlight. Together with the movement of the waves, this breaks the plastic into ever smaller pieces. An emerging problem is caused by the way these \u2018microplastics\u2019 can accumulate harmful chemicals such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from the sea. When these are concentrated on a tiny piece of plastic, swallowing it can be deadly for some marine organisms. These small plastic particles also become part of the beach. For example, some studies have found many types of plastic to be commonplace in the sediment on the British coastline. And it\u2019s not just wildlife that is affected by marine litter. It can eventually enter the human food chain, when microplastics are ingested by fish or shellfish which may subsequently be eaten by people. Researchers are currently looking into this emerging potential health risk. There are also economic costs of this pollution, from beach cleaning to ruined fishing gear, from reduced tourism to fouled ship propellers. Such costs are set to grow as litter concentrations continue to increase in some areas. Poor waste management and careless littering on land are two of the main causes of the problem, as waste is discharged into the sea via rivers or sewerage pipes, or washed into the sea by the wind and rain. Waste from cargo ships, cruise liners and fishing boats also often ends up in the ocean. A cleaner sea Because a large part of marine litter is consumer waste, educating people on its effects could significantly reduce the waste going into the sea, according to several studies. Shops should also take on some of the responsibility, for example making it easier for customers to return bottles or phasing out single-use plastic bags. The waste management industry also has a part to play in more effectively collecting and processing litter which would otherwise end up in the sea. Next year the EEA will launch \u2018Marine LitterWatch\u2019, a new mobile phone app for conservation groups and other \u2018citizen scientists\u2019 to log and report the amount of litter they find on the beach. This information will help the EEA understand this growing problem and also provide data to support better policy implementation. Litter is not the only problem affecting Europe\u2019s beaches. Untreated sewage and animal manure from farms also finds its way into the sea, which can be a risk to human health. To assess this problem, the EEA collates data on bacteria levels from more than 22 000 beaches across Europe.

It is expected that most sites will have similar water quality to previous years, as the environmental pressures are the same in most cases. However, this season a combination of warm weather, relatively calm conditions and in some areas a considerable level of nutrient pollution has led to blue-green algal blooms have appeared in some lakes and near some beaches. In general, the blue-green algal blooms are worse in lakes, but are also present in seas, including the Baltic Sea and North Sea. Bloom and scum-forming blue-green algae can produce toxins. These toxins can kill wild animals, farm livestock and domestic pets. In humans, they can cause rashes after skin contact and illnesses if swallowed.

We are making some progress towards the EU aim of creating a green economy, but we need to keep the pressure on up to 2020 and beyond. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The \u2018green economy\u2019 has emerged as a priority in policy debate in recent years. But what does the concept mean in practice and how can one measure progress towards this strategic goal? A new EEA report, \u2018Towards a green economy in Europe\u2019, provides some answers. It does so through a comprehensive overview of environmental targets and objectives established by EU legislation for the period 2010\u20132050 and by providing examples of analysis of progress towards achieving them. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cThis report shows that while we have been successful in agreeing a wide range of policies to protect the environment, implementing these policies remains a challenge. We are making some progress towards the EU aim of creating a green economy, but we need to keep the pressure on up to 2020 and beyond.\u201d The report identifies 63 legally binding targets and 68 non-binding objectives set out in EU policy covering the period 2010\u20132050. Of the 63 legally-binding targets, 62 have their deadlines in 2020 or before. Most of the current targets and objectives can be seen as interim steps towards a transition to a green economy, because in most cases eradicating the problems will require longer-term efforts beyond 2020. The \u2018green economy\u2019 is an economic model which aims to increase prosperity by using resources efficiently as well as maintaining the resilience of the natural systems that sustain societies. With its 'Environmental indicator report 2012', the EEA undertook its first analysis of Europe\u2019s progress in the transition towards a green economy, using indicators to assess resource efficiency and to address ecosystem resilience. The findings show a mixed performance, although they suggest that Europe has made more progress in improving resource efficiency than preserving ecosystem resilience. The new overview is useful as a comprehensive basis for reviewing progress in the past, and for considering the prospects for meeting future environmental policy objectives and targets. Progress towards environmental targets in Europe The EU has a non-binding objective to cut energy use to levels 20 % below business-as-usual projections by 2020. Although this implies that consumption must be a little lower than the level in the mid-1990s, the trend since then has moved upwards. So it appears likely that achieving the 2020 objectives will require stronger policy implementation and possibly additional policy impulses. Alongside policies to mitigate climate change, the EU has several policies to help Member States adapt. The European Commission encourages all Member States to adopt comprehensive adaptation strategies. By mid-2013, 16 States had achieved this. Regarding air pollution, the EU has generally made good progress towards its 2010 emissions targets set by the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution. Meeting 2020 targets will require continued efforts.\u00a0 Only in the case of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is there an obvious need to accelerate abatement efforts significantly. Modelling also suggests that achieving the targets is technically feasible for all pollutants except PM2.5. Waste generated per capita should be in absolute decline by 2020, according to another non-binding objective. Waste generation shows a trend which, when extrapolated, suggests that the EU would narrowly miss its 2020 target. The trend is certainly ambiguous, however, with the decline in waste generation since 2007 giving some cause for encouragement. Member States also have another waste-related objective, specifying that landfilling of waste should be near zero by 2020. An extrapolation of the trend points to a decline from 179 kg per capita in 2011 to 114 kg per capita in 2020, so achieving the target for near-zero landfill appears to require a radical change in waste management practices.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/an-overview-of-eu-environment"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0360", "date": "2013-07-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Populations of grassland butterflies decline almost 50 % over two decades", "text": "This dramatic decline in grassland butterflies should ring alarm bells \u2013 in general Europe\u2019s grassland habitats are shrinking.

Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The fall in grassland butterfly numbers is particularly worrying, according to the report, because these butterflies are considered to be representative indicators of trends observed for most other terrestrial insects, which together form around two thirds of the world\u2019s species. This means that butterflies are useful indicators of biodiversity and the general health of ecosystems. Seventeen butterfly species are examined in 'The European Grassland Butterfly Indicator: 1990\u20132011\u2019, comprising seven widespread and 10 specialist species. Of the 17 species, eight have declined in Europe, two have remained stable and one increased. For six species the trend is uncertain. Butterflies examined in the report include the Common Blue (Polyommatus icarus), which has declined significantly, the Orangetip (Anthocharis cardamines), which seems to be stable since 1990, and the Lulworth Skipper (Thymelicus acteon), which shows an uncertain trend over the last two decades.

If we fail to maintain these habitats we could lose many of these species forever. We must recognise the importance of butterflies and other insects \u2013 the pollination they carry out is essential for both natural ecosystems and agriculture.\u201d Why are butterflies disappearing? Intensifying agriculture and abandoned land are the two main trends affecting the populations of grassland butterflies. Agriculture has intensified where the land is relatively flat and easy to cultivate, and, on the other hand,large areas of grasslands have been abandoned in mountainous and wet regions, mainly in eastern and southern Europe. Both intensification and abandonment result in the loss and degradation of habitat for grassland butterflies. Agricultural intensification leads to uniform grasslands which are almost sterile for biodiversity. In addition, butterflies are also vulnerable to pesticides, often used in intensively managed farming systems. Farmland is often abandoned for socio-economic reasons. When farming on low-productivity land brings only a small amount of income, and there is little or no support from the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), farmers give up their enterprises and the land is left unmanaged. The grassland becomes overgrown and is soon replaced by scrub and woodland. In some regions of north-western Europe, grassland butterflies are now almost restricted to road verges, railway sidings, rocky or wet places, urban areas and nature reserves. Areas using traditional low-input farming systems, known as High Nature Value Farmland, are also important habitats. Monitoring Europe\u2019s butterflies The report is based on the European Grassland Butterfly Indicator, compiled by De Vlinderstichting (Dutch Butterfly Conservation), Butterfly Conservation Europe and Statistics Netherlands, using data from 1990 to 2011. The indicator brings together information from national butterfly monitoring schemes in 19 countries across Europe, most of them European Union Member States. Thousands of trained professional and volunteer recorders count butterflies on approximately 3\u00a0500 transects scattered widely across Europe. This volunteer fieldwork is essential for understanding the state and trends of Europe\u2019s butterflies. While the report is based on data from 1990 to 2011, it should be noted that in many areas of Europe the current changes in land use began before 1990. The report therefore suggests that the recent halving of butterfly numbers may be the most recent development in a much bigger long-term decline. The EU Biodiversity Strategy recognises the poor conservation status of grasslands. Grasslands should be properly managed, the report states, both within Natura 2000 protected areas and on HNV farmland. A new system of payments under the Common Agricultural Policy could help support better management, the report says. The European Grassland Butterfly Indicator could be used as a measure of success of agriculture policies.

EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx Land is a limited resource, and in Europe we are using more and more previously wild areas for agriculture, forestry, roads and settlements, according to Earth satellite observations of land cover from 1990 to 2006. Some of these data only became available recently and are detailed in a new land cover assessment published by the European Environment Agency (EEA). Although current trends may differ due to the changing economic situation in much of Europe, the data tells an interesting story about Europe\u2019s changing landscape. Roads, buildings and other artificial surfaces are spreading in Europe, and almost half of this spread was on to farmland between 2000 and 2006. To a lesser extent, theseareas also encroached on forests, semi-natural and natural areas. Almost half of these surfaces were new residential areas, services and recreation facilities. However, urban sprawl seemed to be slowing according to the data. Artificial land cover, such as roads and buildings, increased 2.3 % per year between 1990 and 2000, but this rate fell to 1.5 % between 2000 and 2006. While only 4 % of Europe\u2019s land is covered by artificial surfaces, according to the data, this seems to be the only type of land cover which is increasing significantly in Europe. Forested areas cover 34 % of Europe. Grassland and other semi-natural vegetation makes up just 8 % of Europe\u2019s surface, while bare soils and wetlands cover 6 % and 2 % respectively.\u00a0 Approximately 43 % of land is covered by agricultural areas, of which the most common types are non-irrigated arable land (50 %) and pasture (16 %). Both these types increased since 1990, according to the most recent data. The fastest land use change happened in Portugal, Ireland, Hungary, Finland and Sweden. In contrast, the most stable landscape structure is found in mountainous areas such as the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Romanian part of the Carpathians and in the Scandinavian mountains (Norway). Most conversions to forest occurred in Finland and Norway, while most agricultural land conversions took place in Spain. \u201cOur high-consumption lifestyles are putting more pressure on the land,\u201d EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx said. \u201cBut beyond the proportion of land we are covering with concrete, there is another important effect \u2013 roads and other infrastructure are carving valuable habitats into increasingly smaller fragments, with serious consequences for some of Europe\u2019s most endangered species.\u201d Alongside the analysis, the EEA presents more information on land use changes in different European countries in its land take indicator.

So it is essential that we consider how we can use existing resources efficiently before we impose additional demands on land for energy production. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director \u2018Bioenergy\u2019 refers to energy uses of any kind of biomass, whether for heating, power generation or transport. The report, \u2018EU bioenergy from a resource efficiency perspective\u2019, primarily looks at the potential for energy from agricultural land, although it includes forest and waste biomass in the overall analysis. In 2010 bioenergy was the source of approximately 7.5 % of energy used in the EU. This is foreseen to rise to around 10 % by 2020, or approximately half of the projected renewable energy output, according to EU Member States\u2019 National Renewable Energy Plans. Bioenergy should be produced in line with EU objectives to use resources more efficiently, the report says. This means reducing the land and other resources needed to produce each unit of bioenergy and avoiding environmental harm from bioenergy production. According to the EEA analysis, the most efficient energy use of biomass is for heating and electricity as well as advanced biofuels, also called \u2018second generation\u2019 biofuels. First generation transport biofuels, for example, biodiesel based on oilseed rape or ethanol from wheat, are shown to be a far less efficient use of resources. Building on previous analysis, the report shows that the current energy crop mix is not favourable to the environment. The report recommends a broader mix of crops to reduce environmental impacts. Specifically, this should include perennial crops, which are not harvested annually \u2013 for example energy grasses or short rotation willow plantations. This would enhance, rather than harm, \u2018ecosystem services\u2019 provided by farmland \u2013 such as flood prevention and water filtration. Bioenergy is often considered \u2018carbon neutral\u2019, as the carbon dioxide released in combustion is assumed to be compensated by the CO2 absorbed during plant growth. However, as shown in this report, indirect land use change can negate any greenhouse gas savings from biofuel production based on energy crops. This is due to the displacement of crop production onto previously unused land, which can lead to the conversion of forests and savannah to agriculture. Such land use change harms biodiversity and increases greenhouse gas emissions. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cBioenergy is an important component of our renewable energy mix, helping to ensure a stable energy supply. But this study highlights the fact that forest biomass and productive land are limited resources, and part of Europe\u2019s \u2018natural capital\u2019. So it is essential that we consider how we can use existing resources efficiently before we impose additional demands on land for energy production.\u201d Bioenergy in 2020 \u2013 exploring different options The report develops three different \u2018storylines\u2019 with varying technological, economic and policy assumptions. This helps explore different future options, illustrating which bioenergy types are most resource-efficient and which have the lowest environmental impact. The main conclusions of this analysis are below: The EEA has revised its estimate of potential bioenergy production in the EU first published in 2006, reducing the estimate by approximately 40 %. The estimate was revised due to changes in scientific understanding, the changed EU policy framework and accounting for economic factors. Different biomass-to-energy conversion technologies vary significantly in their efficiency. For example, generating electricity by burning pure biomass is only approximately 30-35 % efficient, while burning the same material to produce heat is usually more than 85 % efficient. In general, using bioenergy for heat and power is a considerably more efficient way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, compared to using bioenergy for transport fuel. Different energy cropping systems can vary hugely in their productivity, as well as in environmental impacts. High-yielding systems with efficient conversion can deliver more than 20 times more energy compared to low-yielding inefficient systems using the same land area. Current EU bioenergy policy only partially accounts for potentially adverse environmental effects connected to direct land\u2011use effects, including changes in land management. Additional policies could help reduce these environmental impacts, particularly regarding water resources and farmland biodiversity. The countries with the largest estimated agricultural bioenergy potential in 2020 are France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland and Romania, the report says. Extensively using mature trees for energy purposes may have a negative effect on the climate, due to the long time it takes for the trees to regrow and re-capture the CO2 that is released when wood is used for energy. This \u2018carbon debt\u2019 does not arise if bioenergy uses other forest biomass instead, for example branches left over from forest harvesting by-products or waste products from timber and paper production. Using organic waste and agricultural or forestry residues as feedstock is more resource efficient than many other types of feedstock, as it does not add pressure on land and water resources and offers very high greenhouse gas savings.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/bioenergy-production-must-use-resources"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0363", "date": "2013-07-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Biodiversity-rich Croatia becomes 33rd full EEA member country", "text": "We look forward to even closer cooperation with Croatia as a full EEA member country. I expect the country\u2019s unique natural environment will enrich environmental debates in the EU. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director Many Europeans know Croatia for its crystal clear seas and white beaches, but the country\u2019s biodiversity is also an important part of Europe\u2019s environment. The country is rich in wildlife due to its geographical position at the crossroads of several bio-geographical regions and its unique ecological, climatic and physical conditions. Habitats in Croatia include mountains, forests and a coastline with over a thousand islands and islets in the Adriatic. The country is a migratory route for sea turtles and many kinds of birds. It also has one of the highest diversity of plants of all European countries, and is home to many endangered species. Two thirds of Croatia\u2019s area is land and one third is sea. Almost half of the land area is covered by forest, of which 95 % is largely natural in structure, providing habitats for many types of wildlife. Environmental pressures Croatia has a population of 4.3 million, according to 2011 statistics. Almost two thirds of the population live in urban areas, with approximately 800 000 people in Zagreb, the capital. As with most European countries, environmental pressures come from many different areas. Tourism is particularly important for Croatia, but it also puts pressure on the environment - for example, sailing boats, cruise ships and cargo ships sometimes pollute the sea. Nonetheless, the Croatian coast is one of the best-preserved parts of the Mediterranean, with relatively low pollution loads. Bathing sites in Croatia were ranked above those of most other EU Member States \u2013 95 % of swimming beaches, lakes and rivers were rated as excellent in 2012, a proportion which was only surpassed by three other countries. Only three of Croatia\u2019s 919 bathing water sites had poor quality water. Waste management is one area which requires more work. Despite many improvements in the last decade, further efforts are needed to meet the objectives of EU legislation and waste management strategies. Croatia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are below the country\u2019s target under the Kyoto Protocol, according to the most recent data. Average emissions between 2008 and 2011 were currently 6.5% below the base year, so it seems the country will significantly exceed the agreed 5% reduction objective for the years 2008-2012. In addition, Croatia has been participating in the EU Emissions Trading System since 1 January 2013. Croatia and the EEA \u201cIn common with several other countries before it, Croatia has cooperated with the EEA for many years before joining the EU,\u201d EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx said. \u201cWe look forward to even closer cooperation with Croatia as a full EEA member country. I expect the country\u2019s unique natural environment will enrich environmental debates in the EU.\u201d Since 2003, Croatia has participated in Eionet (European Environment Information and Observation Network) and EEA programmes and activities as a cooperating country, providing data and information to the EEA. For example, data on air quality is sent to EEA, including near-real time data which is sent every hour from some monitoring stations. Croatian authorities provided information for a recent environmental indicator report covering the West Balkans. At the same time, Croatia has been part of a regional EEA/West Balkans Programme, sharing experience between countries. As part of efforts to improve environmental policy, the Mediterranean country has established an operational Environment Information System, organised according to SEIS principles.

We also need to think beyond purely technical measures, working towards a structural shift in our economy and promoting international cooperation. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are mainly caused by traffic, although this pollutant is also emitted by industrial facilities and power plants. This pollutant and many others are still harming health and the environment across Europe. For three pollutants - ammonia (NH3), NMVOC and fine particles (PM2.5) - emission levels in 2011 are already very close to the 2020 reduction commitments under international legislation, according to the EEA technical report, indicating that the EU could aim for more ambitious targets. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cAir pollution still has an impact on Europeans and our environment. Europe can go beyond the emissions reductions that have already been achieved. We also need to think beyond purely technical measures, working towards a structural shift in our economy and promoting international cooperation.\u201d The UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) was agreed in order to limit air pollutants causing acid rain and eutrophication, often far away from the source of the pollution as air currents carry the pollutants long distances and across borders. Many of the pollutants addressed also harm human health, causing a range of problems from respiratory illnesses to cardiovascular disease, leading to premature death in some cases. The Gothenburg Protocol to the UNECE LRTAP Convention contains emission reduction commitments that have to be met from 2010 and onwards, for the pollutants nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulphur oxides (SOx) and ammonia (NH3). In addition to the emission reduction commitments for individual countries, the protocol also specifies reduction commitments for the EU. NOx is the only pollutant for which the 2011 emissions exceeded the respective EU emission reduction commitment. For the remaining pollutants, the emissions in 2011 were below the respective air pollutant reduction commitments. The Protocol was recently updated to include five targets for the year 2020, including a target for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Past air pollutant emission reductions Since 1990 the EU\u2019s most successful reduction of air emissions has been cutting sulphur dioxide (SO2) - in 2011 emissions were 82 % lower than in 1990. Many other air pollutant emissions have more than halved during this time, including the main heavy metals (lead, cadmium, mercury), and persistent organic pollutants such as dioxins and furans, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Between 2010 and 2011, emissions of most main air pollutants continued to fall, including NOx, sulphur dioxide (SO2), NMVOCs and carbon monoxide. For all pollutants except NOx, the European Union\u2019s emissions were below the respective reduction commitments in 2011. There are many reasons for emission reductions, including power stations switching from solid and liquid fuels to fuels such as natural gas, new legislation limiting vehicle exhaust emissions, flue-gas scrubbing technology in industry, reduced sulphur content in some liquid fuels, lower point-source emissions from industrial facilities, and the closure of older industrial facilities as a consequence of economic restructuring. Background information The report includes emissions over the period 1990-2011 for the air pollutants sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), heavy metals (HMs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The inventory compiled by the EEA on the basis of data submitted by EU Member States is largely complete for 5 (NOx, NMVOCs, SO2, NH3, CO) out of 26 air pollutants. Member State submissions contain various data gaps for particular pollutants or years in the time series.

The good news is that there is huge Potential for using new technologies which are well-suited to the way vans are used, including electric or hybrid vehicle technology.\u201d Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director The average van sold emitted 180.3 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer (gCO2/km), according to the data, which covers most light commercial vehicles sold in the EU. Current emissions are slightly higher than the 175 gCO2/km target to be met by\u00a02017. By 2020, emissions should be 147 gCO2/km, which is 18.5% lower than current levels.

Each manufacturer has an individual target, calculated using the average mass of their registered vehicles. All individual manufacturer targets in combination make up the European industry target \u2013 by 2020, emissions should be on average below 95 gCO2/km for new cars and 147\u00a0CO2/km for new vans.

The data are provisional and subject to confirmation, final figures will be available by the end of the year. Main findings The database lists approximately 1.1 million new vans sold in the EU. Approximately three quarters of these vehicles were sold in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Diesel vehicles represent 97% of the newly registered vehicle fleet.\u00a0 Just over 1 % of newly registered vehicles used liquid petroleum gas (LPG) or natural gas (NG), and these vehicles had on average 10 to 15 % lower emissions than diesel vans. Pure electric vehicles represent 0.5% of the vehicles sold. This technology is particularly appropriate for urban deliveries and short trips. Electric vehicles also emit zero exhaust emissions and make little noise. Although they also cause some indirect emissions from power generation, this is outside the scope of this analysis. The average van sold in Cyprus had the lowest carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per kilometre (141g CO2/km). At the other end of the scale, emissions were 43 % higher for the average van sold in Slovakia (201g CO2/km). About this database The collection of data for vans is more complex than for passenger cars, due to the relatively high number of vehicles type-approved in multiple stages. In the case of multi-stage vans, the base vehicle manufacturer is responsible for the CO2 emissions of the final vehicle, according to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011. The current monitoring system cannot adequately capture these vehicles, which means that the current database is not yet fully representative of the new vans to be targeted by the legislation.

The air pilot project demonstrates the potential for cities and European partners to build capacity and learn from each other in improving implementation.\u201d Main findings of the project Almost all cities kept emissions inventories listing the pollutants released, but using different methodologies \u2013 making it difficult to compare between different cities or regions. Many of these inventories do not take into account all pollutants, the report says. Some experts from cities underlined the need for better input data to inventories and more training and guidance. Air quality modelling varies significantly between different cities. In some cases, modelling is hampered by issues with data in the original inventories. Some cities also had problems with other input data used in modelling, for example meteorological data or city topography. Many city representatives said that the results of models were often highly complex, and therefore required a lot of resources to interpret. Experts participating in the Air Implementation Pilot suggested more detailed requirements regarding the location and representativeness criteria for monitoring stations. Most of the pollution-reduction measures taken by cities are traffic-related. Some representatives of the cities said they were uncertain about how to evaluate the effectiveness of measures, and their costs and benefits. This situation would be improved with better inventories and modelling tools, the report concludes. The experts also asked for further support in the form of new EU regulations. Most cities are promptly providing information to the public as required by legislation, mostly through dedicated air quality websites. In general, the cities make little use of mass media, social media and new technologies like smartphone applications, the report says. Potential of industrial emissions reductions In a forthcoming assessment, the EEA will look at the potential for cutting air pollution from\u00a0selected power plants in the European Union.

But in many cases, flood risk is also the result of where, and how, we choose to live \u2013 increases in costs from flooding in recent decades can be partly attributed to more people living in flood-prone areas. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director Floods, storms and other hydro-meteorological events account for around two thirds of the damage costs of natural disasters, and these costs have increased since 1980, according to a recent EEA assessment of climate change impacts in Europe. The observed increase in damage costs from extreme weather events is mainly due to land use change, increases in population, economic wealth and human activities in hazard-prone areas and to better reporting. \u00a0To confirm the exact role played by climate change in flooding trends in past decades, it would be necessary to have more reliable, long-time series data for rivers with a natural flow regime. In any case, it is likely that rising temperatures in Europe will intensify the hydrological cycle, leading to more frequent and intense floods in many regions. Although quantitative projections for flood frequency and intensity are uncertain, the contribution of climate change to the damage costs from natural disasters is expected to increase in the future due to the projected increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events in many regions. Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cConsidering flood risk in Europe, we can see climate change will be an increasingly important factor. But in many cases, flood risk is also the result of where, and how, we choose to live \u2013 increases in costs from flooding in recent decades can be partly attributed to more people living in flood-prone areas.\u201d Adapting to flood risk Europe needs to adapt to climate change that is happening now, and anticipate future changes, according to a recent EEA report on climate change adaptation in Europe. Adaptation measures can be broadly categorised as \u2018grey\u2019 measures such as technological and engineering projects, \u2018green\u2019 ecosystem-based approaches using nature, and so-called \u2018soft\u2019 measures such as policies to change governance approaches. The most effective adaptation projects often combine two or more different approaches. \u00a0To put this into action, territorial and physical planning have an important role to play. Possible actions to reduce the impacts of floods are addressed in this report and also in the recent EEA report on European water resources in the context of vulnerability. For example, 'Room for the River' or similar concepts are applied in various EU Member States. Rivers are given more room to overflow at specific locations. This \u2018room\u2019 is created in a number of ways, such as lowering floodplains, relocating dykes, or allowing artificially reclaimed land to be re-submerged. In addition to safety, the river area can thus be made more resilient, healthy and attractive, offering more room for nature and recreation. Cities are also working on actions to reduce their vulnerability to flooding. According to an EEA report on urban adaptation to climate change, roughly one fifth of European cities with over 100 000 inhabitants is very vulnerable to river floods. Impermeable surfaces (\u2018soil sealing\u2019) can prevent water from draining, leading to increased risk of flooding, according to this interactive map published by the EEA this year. The report provides various examples of cities that have adaptation strategies or have taken action to adapt. The European Union is addressing flood risk through the Floods Directive. Countries are required to draw up flood risk maps by 2013 and establish flood risk management plans focused on prevention, protection and preparedness by 2015. In April 2013 the European Commission adopted a Communication on an \u2018EU strategy on adaptation to climate change\u2019 which aims at contributing to a more climate resilient Europe. The strategy aims to enhance the preparedness and capacity to respond to the impacts of climate change at local, regional, national and EU levels. Green infrastructure can also reduce flood risk. Green infrastructure is a network of natural and semi-natural areas designed and managed to deliver a range of ecosystem services, for example wetlands which can absorb excess rainwater. In May 2013, the Commission adopted a communication on green infrastructure. \u00a0 Copernicus helps flood response In responding to the flooding, the German authorities have called on Copernicus, the Earth observation programme of the EU, to help provide maps of the areas affected. The maps, which are helping national emergency services to plan their response, are based on satellite data provided through the European Space Agency and detailed spatial reference data owned by regional German mapping authorities. Within the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, national reference data for use during crises is facilitated through the EEA's GISC project and an agreement signed with Eurogeographics. Coincidentally, data access arrangements, which make the German data available free of charge, were only put in place last week.

The competition is open to citizens of the all EEA member and cooperating countries. All participants must be 18 or older. Entries could touch on a variety of themes. For example, your entry could be a photograph illustrating wasted food, construction waste, landfills, and recycling. Or perhaps you have an idea for a cartoon showing how we can better reduce, re-use or recycle waste. If you are a filmmaker, you could make a video about how waste policy could be improved, or the resources and energy needed to maintain wasteful lifestyles. However, these are just a few ideas, entrants are encouraged to come up with their own angle. There is a wealth of useful information on waste on the EEA website. For example: The latest analysis from the EEA shows that citizens of some Member States recycle more than 60 % of household waste, however recycling is almost non-existent in some other countries. Recycling has clear economic benefits, according to another EEA report. Waste is also increasingly traded as a resource between countries. Another report showed that Europe\u2019s wasteful lifestyle means that we need to import a large proportion of raw materials from elsewhere. Each person in the EU generates around 160 kg of packaging waste per year on average, according to the latest data. Waste generates almost 3 % of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. \u00a0 Photos, cartoons and videos should be accompanied by a short text.

Personally, I relied on her support and insights, and greatly valued her extensive experience and dedication. Karsten Sach, Chair of the EEA Management Board Since 2003, Prof. McGlade has overseen a significant increase in the coverage and extent of data and information processed and analysed by the EEA/Eionet, and a doubling of the resources for the agency to support this work. In 2003 Turkey joined the Agency, followed by the full accession of 15 countries in 2004 and a continued programme of activities with the associate countries of the west Balkans. In 2006 Switzerland joined the EEA as the 32nd full member country and a cooperation agreement with Greenland entered into force in 2010. The EEA is now formally cooperating on various projects with more than 60 countries across continental Europe, the Arctic, North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and beyond. Today, the topics and themes covered by the EEA include all aspects of environment and climate policy, including related policies in green economy, transport, energy, agriculture, fisheries, tourism and urban development, plus increasingly the impacts of complexity, uncertainty and technological innovations on policy development and implementation. Prof. McGlade has been a strong advocate of using new technologies to improve information gathering and make it accessible to an increasing number of users. For example, during her time at the agency, many new online databases have been created, such as the Water Information System for Europe, the Biodiversity Information Systems for Europe and the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register. Since 2008 Professor McGlade has been instrumental in establishing a Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS). The initiative represents a fundamental shift in the thinking behind environmental reporting and indicator development, bringing together key aspects of national and international research including outputs from the Copernicus Earth observation programme where the EEA/Eionet plays a major role in delivering operational services. Rather than a one-way communication with the public, Prof. McGlade had a vision for Europe that encourages dialogue with citizens, including indigenous peoples in remote regions such as the Arctic. In 2008, the EEA launched Eye on Earth which brought together environmental data in the form of dynamic maps of air and water quality. Eye on Earth was recognised in the 2012 Rio+20 summit declaration as a key public information platform on the environment. Since then, the Eye on Earth Alliance and Network have grown under Prof. McGlade\u2019s leadership to become a global public information service, bringing together knowledge communities around the world in order to share data and information. The project aims to harness the power of regional networks and governments as well as expertise from researchers, leading thinkers and citizen scientists around the world, to build sustainable solutions for the future. The EEA has been a frequent player on the global stage under Prof. McGlade\u2019s leadership. When Copenhagen was chosen for the COP15 climate change conference in 2009, the EEA organised 31 events around the city and six events at the conference centre, involving approximately 3 000 participants. During the last 10 years, frequent collaboration with international organisations such as the United Nations Environment Programme, the Arctic Council and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development has also given the EU a strong voice in international debates. In addition to representing the EEA in multiple fora, Prof. McGlade has presided over the publication of many hundreds of reports, including two editions of \u2018The European Environment \u2013 State and Outlook\u2019, which the EEA is mandated to publish every five years, in 2005 and 2010. She has contributed to many other reports including the second volume of \u2018Late Lessons from Early Warnings\u2019 in 2013. An outstanding communicator, Prof. McGlade has become a regular interviewee on television, radio and in the press, frequently commenting on some of the most pressing issues faced by Europe and the world, including the meaning of happiness and well-being. Under her creative guidance the EEA has produced many multimedia products including Ecoagents and award winning films such as Our Arctic challenge, One Degree Matters and Planet RE:think. Karsten Sach, Chair of the EEA Management Board, said: \u201cJacquie\u2019s abundant energy and intellectual acuity have been a great inspiration to all of us that have worked with her. Personally, I relied on her support and insights, and greatly valued her extensive experience and dedication. She has positioned the EEA as one of the world\u2019s leading providers of environmental information. She has been the driving force behind many projects and initiatives. For example, she was instrumental in setting up the network of Environmental Protection Agencies, which has become extremely important in supporting the implementation of environmental policy across Europe.\u201d She will be succeeded by Belgian Hans Bruyninckx, who will become the new Executive Director on 1 June.

People are now exposed to many different harmful factors, which together are reducing both lifespans and wellbeing. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The environment affects human health in multiple ways, according to the report \u2018Environment and human health\u2019 published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Commission's in-house science service, the Joint Research Centre. While pollutants, noise and other forms of environmental degradation can be harmful, the report underlines the large benefits of access to natural environments for physical and mental wellbeing. Europe\u2019s \u2018health gap\u2019 There is large disparity in the environmental conditions across Europe, which is often reflected in different levels of health and life expectancy, according to the report. People with low social status often live in degraded or harmful environments, with potential negative effects on health. Their condition may be further influenced by other factors, including socio-economic status, life style habits and general health status. New risks and new understanding As people live longer, the main causes of premature death and disability have become non-communicable, \u2019lifestyle\u2019-related conditions, such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. In so far as these problems may be linked to environmental conditions, it has become increasingly important to address all these issues together, the report says. People are usually exposed to multiple environmental factors throughout their lives, and more research is needed to understand the impacts, the report says, especially for the most vulnerable in society \u2013 including children, the poor and the elderly. Science needs to move away from focusing on individual hazards and look instead at the complex, combined effects environmental and lifestyle factors are having on our health, the report says. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cThis report really reinforces some of the key links between health and the environment. People are now exposed to many different harmful factors, which together are reducing both lifespans and wellbeing.\u201d \u00a0Key findings Global sales of products from the chemicals sector doubled between 2000 and 2009, and there is an increasing range of chemicals on the market, including substances affecting human health. There is growing concern about \u2018endocrine disrupting chemicals\u2019, which affect the hormone system, found in a wide range of common products including pharmaceuticals, pesticides and cosmetics. Effects are not yet fully understood, but the chemicals may contribute to declining sperm count, genital malformation, impaired neural development, obesity and cancer. The report highlights evidence showing the contribution of air pollution to cancer, heart disease, bronchitis and asthma and estimates that air pollution reduces each EU citizen's life expectancy by an average of 8.5 months.\u00a0 Recent studies of air pollution suggest that exposure in early life can significantly affect adult health, and the effect of air pollution on pregnancy may be comparable to that of passive smoking. Up to 95% of city dwellers are still exposed to levels of fine particulate matter (PM) above World Health Organisation guidelines, the report says. In Europe, an increasing health concern in relation to water quality is pharmaceutical residues and endocrine-disrupting substances, which are not always fully removed by water treatment. Water shortages and water quality issues may be further exacerbated by climate change, the report says. Noise can seriously harm health, affecting cognitive development, cardiovascular disease and sleep. Noisy areas are often those with high levels of air pollution, and each factor seems to augment the effect of the other. Devices emitting electro-magnetic fields (EMF) such as mobile phones are sometimes considered a possible cancer risk, but there is no conclusive scientific evidence supporting this link. Available data are reviewed regularly by the Commission's scientific committees. The next review will be published in the second half of 2013. Nanotechnology applications might be an emerging risk, as little is known about the effects of nanomaterials in the human body. This will require an adequate assessment of potential risks, to guarantee the safe production of nanomaterials and their safe use in consumer products. Green spaces seem to have multiple physical and mental health benefits. There are significant differences in access to these areas across Europe \u00a0\u2013 all cities in Sweden and Finland have more than 40 % green space within their boundaries, while at the other end of the scale all Hungarian and Greek cities have less than 30 % green space.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/europe2019s-environment-now-healthier-2013"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0374", "date": "2013-05-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Greenhouse gases: 2011 emissions lower than previously estimated", "text": "The greenhouse gas emissions cut in 2011 is good news, however, it was largely due to a warmer winter. Nonetheless, the EU is making clear progress towards its emission targets. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The European Union\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2011 were 18.4 % below 1990 levels, according to the EU greenhouse gas inventory. When international aviation is included, in line with the climate and energy package, greenhouse gas emissions fell 17 % in the EU since 1990. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cThe greenhouse gas emissions cut in 2011 is good news, however, it was largely due to a warmer winter. Nonetheless, the EU is making clear progress towards its emission targets.\u201d She continued: \u201cThere was an increase in consumption of more carbon-intensive fuels such as coal, while hydroelectricity production and gas consumption decreased. If Europe is to achieve the transition towards a low-carbon society, it will need sustained investment in technology and innovation.\u201d Why were greenhouse gas emissions lower? The 2011 emissions decrease was largely due to a milder winter in 2011 compared to 2010, which led to a lower demand for heating. The officially reported 2011 emissions were 3.3 % lower than the previous year, while the EU experienced a 1.6 % growth in GDP. The reduction in emissions is larger than EEA\u2019s estimates published last year, because the extent of the reduced heating demand only became apparent when complete and final energy data became available. The highest emissions reductions were from homes and commerce. Trends in EU greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990/Kyoto Protocol base year Other findings Almost two thirds of the emissions reduction in 2011 came from the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The largest increases in the absolute volume of emissions were in Romania, Bulgaria and Spain. Fossil fuel consumption decreased by 5 % in the EU. However, the average carbon intensity of the fossil fuels used increased, with solid fuel consumption, such as hard coal and lignite, rising by almost 2 % between 2010 and 2011. Liquid fuel consumption decreased by 4 % and natural gas consumption fell by almost 11 %. Biomass combustion increased by less than 1% in EU-27 in 2011. Consumption of energy from renewable sources had the second largest decline of the last 21 years in percentage terms, mainly due to significantly lower hydroelectricity production. Wind and solar, however, continued increasing strongly in 2011. Nuclear power\u2019s contribution to electricity also declined in the EU in 2011 compared to 2010, mainly due to closure of power plants in Germany, according to Eurostat energy data. Road transport emissions continued to decline in 2011 for the fourth consecutive year. In contrast, emissions from international aviation and shipping increased in 2011. Early indications of 2012 figures Official total EU greenhouse gas emissions inventory data submitted to the UNFCCC are only available up to 2011. However, there other EU emission data sets which provide an increasingly complete picture of emission changes in 2012: Verified greenhouse gas emissions in sectors covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS, covering approximately 40 % of total EU greenhouse gas emissions) fell by 2% between 2011 and 2012; Early estimates published today by Eurostat and based on monthly energy statistics of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion (covering approximately 80% of EU total greenhouse gas emissions) also point to a 2.1 % decrease between 2011 and 2012; In early autumn, the EEA will publish the Approximated EU Greenhouse Gas Inventory, covering total EU emissions for 2012. This report will cover emissions of all gases from all major sectors reported under the UNFCCC. The report will be used by the EU to assess current progress towards emission targets; The official EU greenhouse gas inventory for 2012 will only become available in late May 2014 and will be officially submitted to the UNFCCC by the EU. As with this year, it will be the result of a compilation made by the EEA on behalf of the European Commission, in close collaboration with the EU Member States, the EEA\u2019s European Topic Centre on Air Pollution and Climate Change Mitigation (ETC/ACM), the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre (JRC), Eurostat and Directorate-General Climate Action (DG CLIMA).

Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director Cyprus and Luxembourg stand out with all listed bathing sites achieving excellent water quality. Eight other countries have excellent quality values above the EU average: Malta (97 %), Croatia (95 %), Greece (93 %), Germany (88 %), Portugal (87 %), Italy (85 %), Finland (83 %) and Spain (83 %). This is an improvement on last year's results, continuing the positive trend since bathing water monitoring began under the Bathing Water Directive in 1990. Environment Commissioner Janez Poto\u010dnik said: \"It's encouraging to see the quality of European bathing waters continuing to improve. But more remains to be done to ensure all our waters are suitable for bathing and drinking and that our aquatic ecosystems are in good health. Water is a precious resource and we need to put into practice all the necessary measures to protect it in full.\" Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cFrom northern fjords to subtropical beaches, Europe is rich in places to cool down in the summer. Today's report demonstrates that bathing water quality is generally very good, but there were still some sites with pollution problems, so we urge people to check the rating of their favourite swimming place.\u201d Every year, the European Environment Agency (EEA) compiles bathing water data gathered by local authorities at more than 22 000 sites across the 27 European Union Member States, Croatia and Switzerland, and measuring levels of bacteria from sewage and livestock. More than two thirds of sites are coastal beaches, with rivers and lakes making up the remainder.\u00a0\u00a0 Each annual report is based on data from the previous bathing season, so this year's bathing water\u00a0report is a compilation of data gathered in summer 2012. In spite of the general improvement, this year's report reveals that almost 2 % of bathing sites at beaches, lakes and rivers have poor water quality. The highest proportions of non-compliant bathing sites were in Belgium (12 %), the Netherlands (7 %) and the United Kingdom (6 %). Some of these beaches had to be closed during the 2012 season. In general, coastal bathing sites score highly, with more than 95 % of EU sites meeting the minimum requirements and 81 % rated as excellent. In comparison, 91 % of bathing waters in lakes and rivers score above the minimum threshold and 72 % have excellent quality.\u00a0\u00a0 Storm water overflows, caused when sewers cannot cope with heavy rains, are still a problem in some areas, although better water treatment and fewer raw sewage discharges into the environment have improved water quality. In the early 1990s, only around 60 % of sites had excellent quality water, while 78 % have excellent quality in this year's report. Over the same period, bathing water sites meeting at least the minimum standards have increased from 70 % to 94 %. Background Bathing water in Europe needs to comply with standards set in the 2006 Bathing Water Directive, which updates and simplifies previous legislation. It has to be implemented by EU Member States by December 2014. The EU publishes an annual summary report on the quality of bathing water, based on reports that the Member States must submit before the end of the previous year. In this year's report, all 27 Member States as well as Croatia\u00a0 and Switzerland monitored and reported bathing water quality, most of them according to the new provisions.\u00a0 To monitor the quality of bathing waters, laboratories analyse levels of certain types of bacteria, including intestinal enterococci and Escherichia coli bacteria. These may indicate the presence of pollution, mainly from sewage or livestock waste. Sites are classified as compliant with mandatory values, compliant with the more stringent guidelines, or non-compliant.\u00a0 Citizens can find out about the water quality at their favourite swimming spot by visiting the EEA's Bathing Water Web Site. The site allows users to download data and check interactive maps. People can also report the state of their local water using the\u00a0Eye on Earth\u00a0website.\u00a0 More information: European Environment Agency bathing water site European Commission bathing water site", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/europe2019s-bathing-waters-continue-to-improve"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0377", "date": "2013-05-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Green fiscal reform can create jobs and stimulate innovation across the EU", "text": "Throughout Europe people are clearly very concerned that solutions to the crisis should be fair, so it is apt to make polluters pay the costs that they currently impose on the rest of society. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The findings come from a series of studies from the European Environment Agency (EEA) looking at the potential for fiscal reform in four EU countries affected by the current economic crisis. Proposals for environmental fiscal reform received a positive reaction when presented to government representatives in Portugal recently, the latest country to be analysed by EEA. Since 2010, similar analyses have been undertaken and presented for Spain, Italy and Ireland. Environmental fiscal reform (EFR) can encourage growth by reducing taxation on labour and investment \u2013 for example, income tax and corporation tax \u2013 and shifting the tax burden to the production and consumption of environmentally-harmful goods and services. Another feature of EFR is removing harmful subsidies, for example, those given for fossil fuels, and using the revenues saved to stimulate renewable energy and resource-efficient technologies. Studies have demonstrated that environmental taxes can achieve environmental objectives at the same time as raising revenues. Modelling shows that they also have a less negative effect on GDP compared to other types of taxes, such as direct taxes, for example income tax, or indirect taxes such as value added tax. This crucial feature of environmental taxes means countries could use them to support either fiscal consolidation or to reduce other taxes. Environmental taxes can change behaviour, encouraging consumers to redirect their consumption towards less taxed commodities. Such incentives would likely create both low and highly skilled jobs, for example in the recycling and energy efficiency sectors. The shift in taxation can also stimulate innovation in the longer term. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cEuropean governments are looking for effective ways to create sustainable growth. Environmental fiscal reform is an idea whose time has come. Throughout Europe people are clearly very concerned that solutions to the crisis should be fair, so it is apt to make polluters pay the costs that they currently impose on the rest of society.\u201d Potential in Portugal Portugal had the highest share of environmental taxes as a percentage of GDP of any Member State in the late 1990s. By using environmental tax approaches currently implemented in other EU Member States, Portugal could revert to this level, raising additional revenue of \u20ac3 billion. Opportunities for Portugal include taxing diesel and petrol cars equally, and bringing in new taxes on a variety of goods including drinks packaging, shopping bags and pesticides. Further revenue raisers could include air travel taxes, an air pollution charge for heavy-goods vehicles and a royalty for old hydropower and other natural resources. Environmentally harmful subsidies could be cut, the report says. Portugal spends more than most other Member States on subsidising private company cars. Portugal could also cut more than \u20ac 200 million of other environmentally-harmful subsidies, the report says. Environmental taxation and the removal of environmentally harmful subsidies have been repeatedly emphasised as potentially integral parts of the European Semester. The measures can contribute to a wider fiscal consolidation process in Member States, while helping to restructure economies in line with resource-efficiency objectives.

Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The three banned insecticides are clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiametoxam. A recent assessment from the European Food Safety Authority also found that there were \u201chigh acute risks\u201d from the three insecticides. In the recent EEA report \u2018Late Lessons from Early Warnings, volume II\u2019, published in January this year, the EEA considered the body of evidence surrounding imidacloprid from scientific studies, beekeepers and industry, concluding that the chemical should be withdrawn from the market given the evidence of harm and scale of the risk. The insecticides may directly affect a wide range of organisms, both on land and in water. In addition, honeybees and other insects perform vital pollination to crops and wild plants. The recently published Late Lessons chapter on imidacloprid\u00a0has informed debate within the EU institutions, as it describes how mounting scientific evidence has been systematically suppressed for many years and early warning were ignored. Where such evidence exists, uncertainty should not be an excuse for inaction, the report states. The ban, while welcomed, is limited in scope and should be seen as only a starting point on the discourse over the use of this class of pesticides. It only applies to three of seven neonicotinoids and only for use with \u201ccrops attractive to bees\u201d, so it does not take into account the impacts of neonicotinoids on aquatic invertebrate species, birds or other insects which are also major areas of concern. Neither does the ban cover new neonicotinoid insecticide Sulfoxaflor which may come onto the market soon. \u201cBased\u00a0on the body of evidence, we can see that it is absolutely correct to take a precautionary approach and ban these chemicals,\u201d EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said. \u201cFrance has banned some of these chemicals on sunflower and maize since 2004, and it seems productivity has not been affected \u2013 2007 was France\u2019s best year for yield of these crops for over a decade. Also, any economic analysis should consider the almost immeasurable value of pollination carried out by honeybees and other wild bees. Indeed, continuing to use these chemicals would risk a vital service that underpins European agriculture,\u201d Prof. McGlade said.

But significantly cutting the greenhouse gases from transport will also require a more fundamental change in the transport modes we use and how we use them. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The latest edition of Monitoring CO2 emissions from new passenger cars in the EU includes provisional data on vehicles sold in 2012. It shows that average CO2 emissions from the new car fleet in the EU fell by 2.6 % between 2011 and 2012. In addition to technological changes, the economic crisis may have increased sales of more efficient models in some countries, the report says. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cNew vehicle technology is becoming more efficient, which is an encouraging sign. But significantly cutting the greenhouse gases from transport will also require a more fundamental change in the transport modes we use and how we use them.\u201d Carbon dioxide emissions from road transport increased by 21 % between 1990 and 2011. The sector is responsible for 23% of all CO2 emissions in the EU*. As part of the response to this problem, the EU has a short-term target for average new car emissions to be below 130 grams carbon dioxide per kilometre (g CO2/km) by 2015, and a long term target of 95 gCO2/km by 2020. In 2012, average emissions were 132.2 gCO2/km. Under EU legislation, car manufacturers have individual emissions targets based on the average mass of the cars they sell. 2012 is the first year that manufacturers may face fines if they exceed their target. The EEA will report on compliance with 2012 targets once the data is confirmed later this year. Key findings In 2012, approximately 12 million new cars were sold. This number has decreased since it peaked in 2007, when 15.5 million new vehicles were registered. Registrations of new cars fell furthest in 2012 in Greece (-41 %), Portugal (-38 %) and Cyprus (-25 %), while at the other end of the scale new cars increased by more than 12 % in in Estonia and Hungary. Diesel vehicles represent 55 % of the newly registered vehicle fleet. Diesel cars have traditionally had lower CO2 emissions than their petrol counterparts although this gap has narrowed in recent years. However, it is important to note that diesel cars emit higher levels of some air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, compared to petrol-driven equivalents. The lowest carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per kilometre were in Denmark (117g CO2/km) and Portugal (118 g CO2/km). The largest improvement in efficiency between 2011 and 2012 was in Greece (9 %) and Denmark (6 %). Hungary and Belgium were the only two EU Member States where cars sold in 2012 were on average less efficient than those sold the year before. Cars with the highest average emissions were sold in Latvia (152g CO2/km) and Estonia (150g CO2/km). Alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) include electric cars, hybrids and cars running on alternative fuels such as liquid petroleum gas and ethanol.\u00a0Thirteen per cent of new cars sold in Italy were\u00a0alternative fuel vehicles, the highest proportion in any Member State. Annual pure electric vehicle sales increased 20-fold over the last three years, going from around 700 in 2010 to around 14 000 in 2012. Most of these cars were registered in France (more than 5 500 vehicles in 2012) and Germany (almost 3 000 vehicles). * The numbers are based on the draft EU submission to UNFCCC on 15 April 2013, so small revisions may occur before this data is finally submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by 27 May 2013.

It will require Europeans to cooperate, to learn from each other and to invest in the long-term transformations needed to sustain our well-being in the face of climate change. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The \u2018Adaptation in Europe\u2019 report describes the policies and some of the measures taken at EU level and by European countries. Sofar half of the 32 EEA member countries have plans for adaptation, and some have started to take action, although all countries still have a lot of work to do. While global mitigation efforts should continue to aim to limit global temperature increases to 2 \u00b0C, the report states that it is necessary to prepare for a greater range of temperature increases and other climate changes. This is needed to properly account for the many uncertainties in climatic and socio-economic projections. An earlier EEA report has shown that climate change is already affecting all regions in Europe, causing a wide range of impacts on society and the environment. Further impacts are expected in the future if no action is taken. Observations show higher average temperatures across Europe Precipitation is decreasing in southern regions and increasing in northern Europe. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cAdaptation is about new ways of thinking and dealing with risks and hazards, uncertainty and complexity. It will require Europeans to cooperate, to learn from each other and to invest in the long-term transformations needed to sustain our well-being in the face of climate change.\u201d The report was launched today at a conference on the EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change, which is intended to support coherent and integrated adaptation policies in the EU across different sectors. Europe begins to adapt The report recommends a combination of different measures \u2013 \u2018grey\u2019 measures such as technological and engineering projects, \u2018green\u2019 ecosystem-based approaches using nature, and so-called \u2018soft\u2019 measures such as policies to change governance approaches. The most effective adaptation projects often combine two or more different approaches, the report says. For example, adaptation on France\u2019s Mediterranean coast uses an integrated approach considering climate change, tourism, transport and biodiversity. In urban areas green spaces and water bodies work together with building design to reduce heatwave risks. Barcelona has also started to adapt to water shortages with a new highly efficient desalination plant. This \u2018grey\u2019 project works in tandem with other \u2018soft\u2019 initiatives such as incentives to reduce water consumption, reducing the impacts from prolonged droughts. While the cost of adaptation may be high in some cases, the report emphasises the overall savings from some adaptation actions. One of the largest ecosystem-based adaptation projects is restoring the Danube river basin to its previously natural state. Although it will cost an estimated \u20ac 183 million, it should help prevent flooding such as the 2005 event which alone cost \u20ac 396 million in damages. Early warning systems to help predict forest fires, floods and droughts have been set up in Europe. Such soft measures can help communities cope with risks, the report says. A similar project in Italy has set up early warning systems for mosquito-borne diseases expected to increase with climate change. Future challenges Europe needs to adapt to climate change in a coherent way, ensuring adaptation is integrated in EU and national policies, the report says. There is no \u2018one-size-fits-all\u2019 approach \u2013 adapting to climate change should respond to national and local conditions. There is still uncertainty in climate change projections, and it is difficult to accurately estimate future risks as socio-economic aspects are also changing. For these reasons adaptation planning should be flexible enough to cope with unforeseen circumstances and a range of future climate changes, the report says. For example, the upgrade of the Thames Barrier which protects London from coastal flooding is being planned to keep options open, so it can be adjusted depending on the trend in sea level rise.

Incidents like the week-long smog episode in London during December 1952 which killed several thousand people have not occurred in Europe for many years. However, air pollution is still a problem with severe impacts. Air pollution can trigger and aggravate respiratory diseases; it can damage forests, acidify soils and waters, reduce crop yields and corrode buildings. In particular, pollution from particulate matter and pollution from ozone pose serious health risks to European citizens. Almost one third of Europe's city dwellers are still exposed to excessive concentrations of airborne particulate matter. Air pollution is also found to reduce the life expectancy of the average city dweller by eight months in Europe, or up to two years in some areas. Emissions from car exhausts in urban areas; forest fires; ammonia emitted by agriculture; coal-fired power plants across the planet; and even volcano eruptions affect the quality of the air we breathe. In some cases, the pollutant sources are located thousands of kilometres away from where the damage occurs. We can also see that many air pollutants contribute to climate change and that climate change itself is going to affect air quality in the future.

Emissions from transport are still a major problem, particularly in some cities. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director Several air pollutants are still harming health and the environment in Europe. The most serious air pollutants are particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide, a fact which is also reflected in the new version of AirBase launched today by the European Environment Agency (EEA). AirBase provides publicly-available air quality information for Europe. \"Although the new data shows some clear improvement between 2010 and 2011, Europe still needs to work hard to reduce air pollution,\" EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said. \"Emissions from transport are still a major problem, particularly in some cities.\" Air emissions limits breached by many countries The NEC Directive covers four main air pollutants: sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and ammonia (NH3). These pollutants can cause respiratory problems, contribute to the acidification of soil and surface water, and damage vegetation. An early analysis of the official \u2018final\u2019 2010 data confirms twelve Member States exceeded their respective NOx ceilings. According to preliminary data, seven of these Member States continued to breach these NOx ceilings in 2011, in some instances by significant amounts. The status for 30 European countries is shown on the chart below. The data can be explored in depth in the\u00a0National Emission Ceilings (NEC) interactive chart. Germany was the only Member State to have exceeded three of four emission ceilings under the directive in both 2010 and 2011. Road transport contributes approximately 40 % of total EU-27 NOx\u00a0emissions and is one of the main factors behind the large number of NOx\u00a0exceedances. Reductions of NOx\u00a0from this sector over the last two decades have not been as large as originally\u00a0anticipated. This is partly because transport demand has been higher than expected, and partly because real-world driving conditions have sometimes led to higher emissions than those anticipated with vehicle emission standards. AirBase \u2013 a rich source of air quality information A preliminary analysis of the 2011 air quality data in AirBase indicates that European citizens often breathe air that does not meet the air quality requirements, a problem which is particularly serious in cities. As a new feature this year, the AirBase release is accompanied by\u00a0interactive maps\u00a0showing the measured air pollutant concentration values throughout Europe. The maps provide an overview of the extent of the problem areas and locations where air quality standards are exceeded. Annual mean concentrations of Particulate Matter (PM10) in Europe View Larger Map AirBase contains air quality monitoring data and information made available by 38 countries throughout Europe. The latest Airbase version contains more than 2 billion records reaching from 1973 to 2011 and will enable an updated assessment of the status and trends in air quality in Europe. Understanding air pollution and its impacts One aim of the current\u00a0review of EU air policy is to better understand air pollution in Europe and its impacts to support future policy initiatives. Together with the new version of AirBase, the information on air pollutant emissions is an important resource for Europe\u2019s air policies. EEA\u2019s annual \u2018NEC Directive Status\u2019 and \u2018Air Quality in Europe\u2019 reports, to be published by mid-2013, will further analyse the recent data reported by EU Member States. Following the review of EU air policy, the European Commission is expected to publish a proposal for a revised NEC Directive in the autumn of this year, potentially calling for stricter emission ceilings for 2020 or beyond in order to further protect health and the environment. For the first time, a ceiling for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) may be introduced. In the absence of new legislation, however, the NEC Directive remains in force and requires Member States to keep emissions below national ceilings also in future years.

The choice between either clean air or mitigating climate change is a false dichotomy - Europe needs both. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The shipping sector needs an integrated monitoring, reporting and verification system for emissions in European waters to systematically address both types of emissions together, the report says. Air pollutants emitted by shipping can affect air quality in many areas, particularly around ports and busy shipping channels. The release of greenhouse gases and air pollutants from international shipping has a complex effect on the climate - greenhouse gas emissions have a warming effect, while on the other hand some air pollutants lead to cooling. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cThis study shows the complex effects different emissions are having on the planet. We need initiatives that protect the environment as an overall system. The choice between either clean air or mitigating climate change is a false\u00a0dichotomy - Europe needs both. By avoiding unnecessary movement of goods and improving transport efficiency, we can address both air pollution and greenhouse gas mitigation together.\u201d At the global level, the combined emissions from ships have a net cooling effect on the climate, according to recent scientific literature. This is because these aerosols directly scatter some radiation and indirectly lead to cloud formation. The overall cooling effect is rather uncertain. Nevertheless, it seems that the cooling effect of aerosols is currently larger than the warming effect of greenhouse gas emissions. The EEA has also carried out a model simulation which shows that the direct aerosol cooling effect may be slightly reduced by new EU rules on sulphur content in ship fuels. However, there is still some uncertainty as changes in cloud formation and other direct and indirect effects are not taken into account in this modelling. Shipping\u2019s air pollution problem Compared to other economic sectors, shipping is currently one of the most unregulated sources of air pollution. The report highlights that some success has been achieved through EU legislation, especially on sulphur content of marine bunker fuels where limits are stricter than the international standards. Air pollution from shipping harms health, increasing heart disease, respiratory illnesses and premature death in some cases. Some of these air pollutant emissions also damage the environment through acidification and eutrophication. While some air pollutants are emitted far from land, around 70 % of the global emissions from ships are within 400 km of coastlines, and this rate is much higher in European waters. Moreover, some pollutants from ships can travel hundreds of kilometres in the atmosphere. In some areas, ships can contribute up to 20-30% of the local fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations. Around some busy ports and shipping channels ships can contribution as much as 80 % of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) pollution. The report highlights that there are relatively few measurement data available to attribute shipping\u2019s contribution to local air pollution, although there are some modelling studies. Shipping and carbon emissions In 2007 national and international shipping was responsible for 3.3 % of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions \u2013 and around 30 % of this is emitted on routes passing through European ports. Emissions from the sector are projected to grow by up to 4 % per year over the next decade. There is a clear link between economic growth and the movement of goods, so emissions from shipping currently change in step with the level of economic activity. Carbon dioxide emissions from international shipping departing from EU ports increased by approximately 35 % between 1990 and 2010. Other key pollutants have increased between 35 and 55 % over the same period. However, most emissions types have decreased since 2006, possibly due to the economic downturn and the legislation reducing SO2 levels. Curbing air pollution and greenhouse gases together The report shows that reducing fuel consumption is the best way to reduce emissions. Better fuel efficiency may be the easiest way to cut both air pollution and greenhouse gases, the report says, recommending technical improvements and also different ship operating procedures. If ships reduced their speed by 10 %, known as \u2018slow steaming\u2019, it could cut energy demand by approximately 19 %, according to one study. Some shipping sectors are already switching to liquid natural gas (LNG), leading to an eradication of SO2 emissions, 80 % reduction of NOx and 20 % reduction of CO2. \u2018End-of-pipe\u2019 emissions reductions technologies such as sea water scrubbing can also reduce air pollutants, but would not address greenhouse gases. Environmental legislation Against the background of challenges presented by global trade operations, ships registered in many different countries and marine fuel bunkered in any location in the world, there is currently considerable debate on the regulation of emissions from the shipping sector. The report provides an overview of the various topics that need to be addressed, ranging from ship registration to atmospheric modelling of air quality and climate impacts.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/international-shipping-should-cut-air"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0387", "date": "2013-03-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Highest recycling rates in Austria and Germany \u2013 but UK and Ireland show fastest increase", "text": "In a relatively short time, some countries have successfully encouraged a culture of recycling, with infrastructure, incentives and public awareness campaigns. But others are still lagging behind, wasting huge volumes of resources. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director Overall 35 % of municipal waste was recycled in Europe in 2010, a significant improvement on 23 % in 2001. But many countries will find it extremely difficult to meet EU-mandated targets to recycle 50 % of household and similar waste by 2020. The information comes from a new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA) which looks at the management of municipal solid waste, mainly consisting of household waste, in 27 EU Member States, Croatia, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey. Although five countries have already achieved the target, most others will need to make extraordinary efforts to achieve this before the deadline. For example; at present, Bulgaria and Romania seem to recycle small proportions of municipal waste, so in order to meet the target by 2020 they must increase recycling by more than 4 percentage points per year during this decade \u2013 something which no country managed to do between 2001 and 2010. The United Kingdom increased the share of municipal waste recycling from 12 to 39 % between 2001 and 2010, while Ireland raised recycling rates from 11 to 36% over the same period. Slovenia, Poland and Hungary have also dramatically improved recycling rates since joining the EU. Recycling rates are highest in Austria, with 63 %, followed by Germany (62 %), Belgium (58 %), the Netherlands (51 %) and Switzerland (51 %). Alongside the main report, the EEA has also published individual country reports.\u00a0 Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cIn a relatively short time, some countries have successfully encouraged a culture of recycling, with infrastructure, incentives and public awareness campaigns. But others are still lagging behind, wasting huge volumes of resources. The current intense demand for some materials should alert countries to the clear economic opportunities in recycling.\u201d The EEA report is particularly relevant, given that municipal waste is primarily a public sector responsibility and the current economic situation in many EU Member States demands an added focus on how to achieve policy goals most cost-effectively. The report supports European Commission efforts to help EU Member States improve their waste management performance. The document will be launched today at a seminar in Brussels on policy instruments and infrastructure to improve municipal waste management. Other findings Europe is successfully moving up the \u2018waste management hierarchy\u2019, albeit more slowly than required by legislation, the report says. The amount of waste sent to landfill has decreased since 2001, while Europe has increased the amount of waste incinerated, composted and recycled. Recycling can reduce greenhouse gases and save valuable resources. This is because recycled materials replace virgin materials. From a life-cycle perspective, changing municipal waste treatment between 2001 and 2010 has successfully cut greenhouse gas emissions from municipal waste by 56 %, or 38 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent in the EU, Norway and Switzerland, the report says. Preventing waste in the first place is the first priority of EU waste legislation. The municipal waste generated by each EU citizen fell by 3.6 % between 2001 and 2010. However, this may be due to the economic downturn \u2013 waste generation per capita was quite stable between 2001 and 2007. Municipal waste produced by the average Slovakian increased by 39% between 2001 and 2010, while Norwegians and Croatians increased annual municipal waste by 30 and 25 % respectively. At the other end of the scale, several countries reduced the amount of waste they generated \u2013 including Bulgaria (18 % reduction), Estonia (17 %), Slovenia (12 %) and the UK (12 %). Norway, Ireland and Poland reduced the proportion of municipal waste going to landfill most between 2001 and 2010. Improved recycling rates are primarily due to trends in recycling of materials, with less progress in bio-waste recycling. Countries that successfully reduced waste sent to landfill and increased recycling usually used a range of national and regional instruments. These included landfill bans on biodegradable waste or municipal waste that has not been pre-treated, mandatory separate collection of municipal waste fractions, economic instruments such as landfill and incineration taxes, and waste collection fees incentivising recycling. Background Recycling includes material recycling (for example glass, paper, metals and plastics) and composting. The 50% recycling target applies to EU Member States, Norway and Iceland. Countries can choose between four different calculation methods to report compliance with this target. The EEA has chosen one method for its analysis, so it should be noted that other methods mightresult in different outcomes. In addition, it should be noted that the actual recycling rates in a few countries may be higher than reported data indicate because their current reporting excludes recycled packaging wastefrom households. Moreover, countries with very low recycling levels can ask for a derogation period for the target. On 4 March 2013 Eurostat published 2011 municipal waste data, offering further options for analysis. Eurostat uses slightly different categories from the EEA and data are thus not directly comparable with EEA analysis.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/highest-recycling-rates-in-austria"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0388", "date": "2013-03-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Eye on Earth First User Conference: A real eye opener", "text": "By supporting partnerships across the diverse communities of knowledge, we can develop a global understanding of the Earth. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director Over three days (4-6 March), the conference brought together more than 230 participants representing communities in 77 countries. They exchanged views and ideas on how to expand the Eye on Earth community to support sharing of environmental, societal and economic data and information from a wide diversity of knowledge communities. The Global Network of Networks was also launched at the conference and aims to align existing and planned local, national and global networks including Eionet (European Environment\u00a0Information and Observation Network), Sustained Arctic Observing Network and AfricaEIN. The conference outcome was captured in the Dublin Statement. It covers a series of special initiatives on oceans, water, biodiversity, cities and disasters as well as technical development of the platform, citizen science as an important source of knowledge, building capacities across the network and empowerment of Eye on Earth communities. Plenary speakers included Phil Hogan, Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for Ireland, Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency, H.E.

The analyses presented in the report provide policy makers with a tool to target economic incentives and information campaigns, encouraging a shift to more sustainable production and consumption patterns in order to reduce Europe\u2019s global footprint. \u00a0The report discusses two analytical approaches. The production-based method considers direct environmental pressures caused by European industries and service providers - for example,\u00a0the extraction of material resources by the mining and quarrying sector, air pollutants from power stations, greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and so on. The consumption-based method focuses on the indirect environmental pressures caused by European consumers. \u00a0In this approach, the direct production-related pressures are attributed to broad groups of products and services, also taking into account pressures that are embodied in goods imported into the EU.\u00a0Using Environmentally Extended Input Output Analysis (EE-IOA) it is possible to estimate the environmental pressures ultimately generated by individual product groups and also by\u00a0European consumption as a whole. Four types of environmental pressures are considered by the report: raw material use, greenhouse gas emissions, acidifying air emissions, and air pollutants leading to harmful ground-level ozone. However, the method has the potential to assess many other types of environmental pressure including land use, water use, waste generation and energy use. Thanks to the conceptual consistency between the system of national economic accounts and environmental accounts, data on environmental pressures is directly comparable to economic expenditure. Policy makers can thus see which sectors have been most successful in decoupling environmental pressures from growth in their output. They can gain an overview of which product groups are most pressure intensive, including\u00a0which groups lead to most emissions or material use per euro of purchase. Electricity, basic metal products, and agricultural products cause high amounts of environmental damage for every euro spent, for example, while most services cause low environmental pressures per euro. The tool also allows the decoupling of pressures from GDP growth to be split up into contributing factors. Through so called \u2018de-composition analysis\u2019, it is possible to investigate reductions in environmental pressures and find out how much\u00a0are due to improvements in production processes, such as energy savings, substitution of fuels and other inputs, or the use of end-of-pipe technologies. It is also possible to see much of the reduction is due to changes in the structure of the economy,\u00a0including\u00a0which types of products are being produced and consumed.\u00a0 In Europe, the report concludes, decoupling of environmental pressures has mainly resulted from improvements in individual industries and production processes rather than changes in patterns of consumption.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/how-to-measure-the-environmental"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0390", "date": "2013-03-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Climate change and flood risk in European cities", "text": "The map is one example of the capabilities of Eye on Earth, an online mapping tool created by the EEA and partners. From 4 to 6 March 2013 the EEA is organising the First Eye on Earth User Conference in Dublin, Ireland. The event will bring together people with a common interest in sharing environmental data and information for public access. What does the map show? During heavy rain, cities may be flooded if the water cannot drain quickly into the ground and the sewage system in cities cannot cope with the amount of water. For this reason, the map also shows the mean percentage of each city covered with impervious surfaces such as buildings, concrete or asphalt, where the soil is \u2018sealed\u2019. Paris, Thessaloniki, Bucharest and Barcelona are just some of the cities with more than three quarters of their surface area sealed, meaning that there may be a risk that water cannot disperse so quickly into the ground during heavy rainfall. However, it is important to be aware that soil sealing is only one factor contributing to increased risk of urban flooding. In 2011, extremely heavy rainfall in Copenhagen caused widespread flooding and damage when the sewers could not cope with the huge volume of water. Insurance damages alone were estimated at \u20ac 650\u2013700 million. However, around 60% of the area of Copenhagen is sealed, less than many other cities. A high amount of artificial areas also increases the temperature in cities. Interestingly, a 2012 EEA report on urban adaptation to climate change noted that green spaces can also help during heat waves by cooling urban areas. In some areas of Europe the number and length of heat waves is also expected to increase due to climate change, visually depicted in this map. Climate change has been observed across Europe, according to another EEA report published in 2012. The effects are very varied across the continent. For example, precipitation has increased in the north, but decreased in the south, and most projections show that both trends will continue throughout this century.

But there is also a hidden cost, paid in years of reduced health and lost life... By incorporating these costs into the price of goods, we can encourage healthier transport methods and cleaner technologies. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director Overall, air pollution is estimated to cause 100 million sick days and 350 000 premature deaths in Europe. Such health effects also have a heavy economic cost \u2013 the report\u2019s authors estimate that the air pollution from HGVs alone costs EEA member countries \u20ac 43-46 billion per year, making up almost half of the approximately \u20ac 100 billion cost of air pollution from\u00a0road transport. The 2011 Eurovignette Directive prescribes how EU Member States could incorporate the health costs from air pollution into any charging structure for large roads and motorways. The revenue from such schemes should be invested in sustainable transport, the Directive states. However, adoption of road user charges depends on a decision by individual countries. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cEuropean economies rely on transporting goods long distances. But there is also a hidden cost, paid in years of reduced health and lost life. This cost is especially high for those living close to Europe\u2019s major transport routes. By incorporating these costs into the price of goods, we can encourage healthier transport methods and cleaner technologies.\u201d While air pollution in Europe has fallen significantly in recent years, it is still a problem in some parts of Europe, where HGVs can be a major factor, the report notes. Diesel, used by most HGVs, causes more air pollution per kilometre than other fuels such as petrol. Exhaust emissions from diesel engines were recently labelled as carcinogenic by the International Agency for\u00a0 Research on Cancer. Heavy goods vehicles are responsible for 40-50% of nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution from road transport in countries covered by the EEA. Both NOx and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are considered in the report, as they can cause respiratory diseases, cardiovascular illnesses and other health problems. Same pollutants, different health costs The cost of air pollution from HGVs is up to 16 times higher in some European countries compared to others, the report notes. The average cost of pollution from a 12-14 tonne Euroclass III lorry is highest in Switzerland, at almost \u20ac 0.12 per kilometre. Costs are also high in Luxemburg, Germany, Romania, Italy and Austria, at around \u20ac 0.08/km. This is because the pollutants cause more harm where there are high population densities, or in landlocked regions and mountainous areas where pollution cannot disperse so easily. At the other end of the scale, the same lorry driving in Cyprus, Malta and Finland causes damage of around half a euro cent per kilometre. In some regions the cost is also much higher than others. Zurich in Switzerland, Bucarest in Romania, Milan in Italy, the Ruhr Valley in Germany and Barcelona in Spain had some of the highest health costs compared to other large urban zones. The calculations show that newer lorries would have a reduced impact, and therefore a lower cost. Euroclass IV lorries, which are up to six years old, or Euroclass V, up to three years old, would cause 40-60% less external costs on the same transport corridors. Charging haulage companies for the external costs of air pollution would incentivise newer and cleaner technologies, the report says. The scheme would also create a level playing field, by internalising the costs that road freight currently imposes on the rest of society. The positive effects of such a scheme have been noted in Switzerland after the country adopted similar legislation. Background The EEA analysis attempts to capture the complexity of different geographical influences on air pollution across Europe. The report includes the average costs of pollution for 66 separate classes of vehicles, with the cost of each estimated on three different types of road (suburban, interurban and highways) in 30 countries and 108 cities. Estimates of cost per kilometre, depending on the vehicle and its surroundings, range from virtually nothing to over 30 eurocents per km for a non-Euroclass lorry more than 20 years old. European Union\u00a0Member States must report to the Commission by October this year on how they will implement road charging, if at all. The detailed figures released by EEA are intended to help Member States decide on individual schemes. The high cost of air pollution is in line with a 2011 EEA analysis, which shows that air pollution from large industrial facilities cost Europe \u20ac 102 \u2013 169 billion in 2009 in lost life, poor health, crop damage and other economic losses. In the coming months, the EEA will publish an update to this report with more recent data.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/reducing-the-20ac-45-billion"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0392", "date": "2013-02-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Invasive alien species: a growing problem for environment and health", "text": "In many areas, ecosystems are weakened by pollution, climate change and fragmentation. Alien species invasions are a growing pressure on the natural world, which are extremely difficult to reverse. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director An alien or non-native species is an organism which humans have introduced \u2013intentionally or accidentally -outside its previous range. It is deemed \u2018invasive\u2019 if it has negative effects on its surroundings, for example by outcompeting or predating on native species that have evolved without specific adaptations to cope with them. In such cases populations of native species can be devastated. Evidence shows that in a growing number of cases invasive alien species even cause harm to human health and society. There are more than 10 000 alien species present in Europe, and the rate of new introductions has accelerated and is still increasing. At least 15 % of these alien species are known to have a negative ecological or economic impact. However, non-native species \u2013 for example, some food crops \u2013 can also have huge benefits. The first report, The impacts of invasive alien species in Europe, details the effects and spread of some species. The second report, Invasive alien species indicators in Europe discusses the methodological approach in bringing this data together. The most common reason species are introduced elsewhere is for horticulture, while others may be brought into new areas for other reasons including farming, hunting, and fishing, or as pets, the report notes. Transport is not always intentional \u2013 for example, zebra mussels have stowed away in the ballast water of ships to proliferate in European lakes. Increasing trade and tourism in recent decades may have led to increasing numbers of alien species. Climate change may also play a role in the spread of these species, the report says, making some areas more favourable to plants and animals originally from elsewhere. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cIn many areas, ecosystems are weakened by pollution, climate change and fragmentation. Alien species invasions are a growing pressure on the natural world, which are extremely difficult to reverse.\u201d Invasive alien species are one of the main threats to biodiversity. Of the 395 European native species listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, 110 are in danger because of invasive alien species. The EU Biodiversity Strategy 2020 has policy targets which aim to address the problem. Impacts on human health For humans, one of the most dangerous effects of invasive alien species is as a carrier of disease. The Asian tiger mosquito has been linked to more than 20 diseases, including yellow fever and chikungunya fever. It has come to Europe mainly through the intercontinental trade in used tyres, and is now prevalent in several southern European countries, especially Italy. Climate change projections show that the mosquito will likely extend its range further north in coming years. Climate change is also enabling the spread northward of the common ragweed. The plant is originally from North America, the seeds first coming to Europe in mixes of grain intended as bird feed. It is a powerful trigger of hayfever and other allergies. Changing landscapes are another result of invasive alien species. For example, the red palm weevil is destroying large numbers of palms in the Mediterranean region, transforming the green spaces in cities. There are also effects on ecosystems which indirectly affect humans. In some cases ecosystems altered by invasive alien species may be less able to provide important \u2018ecosystem services\u2019 which support human activity. For example, the pollination carried out by honeybees may be affected by invasive alien species - the yellow-legged hornet, native to Asia, has been found to devastate beehives in France. Invasive alien species cost Europe around \u20ac 12 billion per year, according to one estimate. Species such as the Spanish slug, now found in most European countries, can devastate crops. Other species such as the pervasive zebra mussel can also cause high costs by fouling water filtration plants and water cooling reservoirs of power plants. Invasive species harming biodiversity Invasive alien species harm native species through predation, as is the case of feral cats killing smaller creatures. Cats have been introduced to approximately 180 000 islands worldwide, and have a significant impact - in Britain alone, cats are estimated to kill 25-29 million birds every year. The American mink was originally brought to Europe for fur farming. Many animals have since escaped or been intentionally \u2018liberated\u2019, so the species is now common in the wild in many areas of Europe. It is now outcompeting its European cousin in many areas, and has had devastating effects on local wildlife, particularly ground-nesting birds Amphibians around the world are in decline, in part due to the invasive chytrid fungus. Other alien species can spread diseases, as is the case with the red swamp crayfish, which carries the \u2018crayfish plague\u2019. The disease often proves deadly to European crayfish, as they have not evolved to cope with the disease. Hybridisation can also be a problem. For example, Japanese knotweed is a particularly virulent hybrid of two alien species originating from different parts of Asia, which first came into contact as alien species in central Europe. The hybrid has been found to spread faster than its parents, outcompeting other plants and altering ecosystems with effects on other species.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/invasive-alien-species-a-growing"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0393", "date": "2013-01-31", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Fewer summer ozone peaks in 2012, but levels still harmful", "text": "The\u00a0information comes from a European Environment Agency (EEA) report on ground-level ozone levels in summer 2012. The pollutant can cause respiratory problems and other severe illnesses, also damaging crops and the wider environment. A new report published today by the World Health Organization suggests\u00a0that ozone exposure may be more harmful\u00a0than previously thought. During summer 2012, the percentage of sites exceeding the \u2018alert threshold\u2019 was the lowest on record, indicating peak episodes were shorter and maximum ozone concentrations were lower. Nonetheless, the \u2018long-term objective\u2019 (LTO) to protect human health was exceeded in all EU Member States apart from Estonia, and it is likely many of them will not meet other targets phased in recently. The lower levels seen during the summer last year were in part due to weather conditions. Ground-level ozone production depends on weather conditions such as sunshine and temperature, and is a result of chemical reactions between other pollutants in the air. These substances are emitted by industry, traffic, farming practices and from other sources. Ozone pollution can travel great distances, meaning that it is both a local air quality issue and also a global, cross-border problem. This edition of the European Environment Agency (EEA) annual report on summer ozone levels covers the period from April to September 2012. It is based on data from 2 107 monitoring sites across Europe. Main findings Monitoring stations report when the \u2018information threshold\u2019 is exceeded. This is a one-hour average ozone concentration of 180 \u03bcg/m3. During summer 2012, the information threshold was exceeded at approximately 28 % of all operational stations, one of the lowest percentages since 1997. The \u2018alert threshold\u2019, a one-hour average ozone concentration of 240 \u03bcg/m3 was exceeded on 25 occasions \u2013 the lowest number on record. This occurred in only seven EU Member States (Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain). As in previous years, the LTO for the protection of human health (maximum daily eight-hour mean concentration of 120 \u03bcg/m3) was exceeded in all EU Member States except Estonia. This level was exceeded at least once at approximately 85 % of all operational stations. The EU also has a target for protecting human health, stating that the LTO should not be exceeded on more than 25 days per year. This threshold was exceeded in 17 EU Member States (Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain) and five other countries submitting data to the EEA (Albania, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Switzerland). As in previous years, the most widespread concentrations occurred in the Mediterranean area.

The new 750-page volume includes 20 new case studies, with far-reaching implications for policy, science and society. Case studies include the stories behind industrial mercury poisoning; fertility problems caused by pesticides; hormone-disrupting chemicals in common plastics; and pharmaceuticals that are changing ecosystems. The report also considers the warning signs emerging from technologies currently in use, including mobile phones, genetically modified organisms and nanotechnology. The historical case studies show that warnings were ignored or sidelined until damage to health and the environment was inevitable. In some instances, companies put short-term profits ahead of public safety, either hiding or ignoring the evidence of risk. In others, scientists downplayed risks, sometimes under pressure from vested interests. Such lessons could help avoid harm from emerging technologies. \u00a0However, five of the stories illustrate \u00a0the benefits of quickly responding to early warnings. The world has changed since the first volume of Late Lessons was published. Technologies are now taken up more quickly than before, and are often rapidly adopted around the world. This means risks may spread faster and further, the report says, outstripping society\u2019s capacity to understand, recognise and respond to these effects in time to avoid harm. The report recommends the wider use of the \u2018precautionary principle\u2019 to reduce hazards in cases of new and largely untested technologies and chemicals. It states that scientific uncertainty is not a justification for inaction, when there is plausible evidence of potentially serious harm. Such a precautionary approach is nearly always beneficial \u2013 after analysing 88 cases of supposed \u2018false alarm\u2019, report authors found only four clear cases. The report also shows that precautionary actions can often stimulate rather than stifle innovation. Key recommendations Science should acknowledge the complexity of biological and environmental systems, particularly where there may be multiple causes of many different effects, the report says. It is increasingly difficult to isolate a single agent and prove beyond doubt that it causes harm. A more holistic view taking many different disciplines into account would also improve the understanding and prevention of potential hazards. Policy makers should respond to early warnings more rapidly, the report says, particularly in cases of large scale emerging technologies. It proposes that those causing any future harm should pay for the damage. Risk assessment can also be improved, the report says, by embracing uncertainty more broadly and acknowledging what is not known. For example, \u2018No evidence of harm\u2019 has often been \u00a0often misinterpreted to mean \u2018evidence of no harm\u2019 when the relevant research was not available. The report calls for new forms of governance involving citizens in choices about innovation pathways and risk analysis. This would help to reduce exposure to hazards and encourage innovations with broader societal benefits. Greater interaction between business, governments and citizens could foster more robust and diverse innovations at less cost to health and the environment.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/the-cost-of-ignoring-the"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0395", "date": "2013-01-07", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "2013: Kicking off the \u2018Year of Air\u2019", "text": "As\u00a0the Eurobarometer survey released today shows, the impact of air pollution is something that European citizens feel strongly about.

Lives are being cut short by air pollution and chronic respiratory disease makes life miserable for many across the continent.\u201d The air quality problem in Europe Europe has made progress in tackling emissions of some air pollutants. For example, sulphur dioxide emissions have been reduced significantly in recent years thanks to EU legislation requiring the use of emissions scrubbing technology and lower sulphur content in fuels. However, a large proportion of the population is still exposed to excessive concentrations of certain air pollutants, leading to health risks and premature death in some areas. The most problematic pollutant for health is particulate matter, which has only decreased slightly over the last decade. The latest science also shows that some environmental impacts of air pollution, such as acidification and eutrophication, are more serious than anticipated. Among others, this is because newer scientific methods are showing that ecosystems are more sensitive than previously judged. While legislation has led to improvements in many cases, real world emissions of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles can still substantially exceed emission limits.

Almost half of Europe\u2019s water bodies will miss the target set by the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and still be in poor ecological status in 2015. \u00a0 \u2018Hydromorphological\u2019 changes, such as dams, straightening and dredging can also damage ecosystems, preventing migration and spawning. This affects around 40 % of rivers and transitional water bodies and 30 % of the lakes. Water use often exceeds water availability, resulting in water stress across much of Europe. This has knock-on effects for the economy and the natural world. Drought is increasing across Europe. The number of countries affected by drought per decade increased from 15 in the period 1971\u20131980, to 28 in the period 2001\u20132011. Climate change is expected to exacerbate this problem. The EEA also reported that the quality of bathing water across Europe declined slightly between 2009 and 2010, but the overall quality was still high. More than nine out of 10 bathing water sites met the minimum requirements in 2011. More positively, the EEA is working with new partners to improve its water data. In December the EEA met with water utilities from across Europe, as a first step to sharing data and improving knowledge on water resources. Solutions to many of Europe\u2019s water problems have been analysed in the European Commission\u2019s Water Blueprint, published in 2012, which was supported by the EEA\u2019s water reports in 2012. All water related EEA findings 2012 can be found on our overview page. Elsewhere in Europe\u2019s environment \u00a0Climate change has been observed in all regions of Europe, the EEA reported in November 2012. The last decade (2002\u20132011) was the warmest on record in Europe, with European land temperature 1.3\u00b0 C warmer than the pre-industrial average. Greenhouse gas emissions fell 2.5 % in 2011, despite renewed economic growth in many areas. A mild winter was the main cause of this decrease. New cars sold in 2011 were 3.3 % more efficient than those sold in 2010. Almost a third of Europe's city dwellers are exposed to excessive concentrations of airborne particulate matter (PM), one of the most important pollutants in terms of harm to human health. Traffic pollution is still a major problem in Europe, causing harmful levels of pollutants including nitrogen oxide levels above legally agreed ceilings. Protected areas now cover more than fifth of Europe\u2019s land, but only 4 % of the marine area controlled by the European Union is protected. This EEA report marks the 20th anniversary of the EU Habitats Directive and also the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. Demand for materials is so intense that between 20 and 30 % of the resources we use in Europe are now imported, damaging ecosystems and human health far beyond Europe\u2019s borders. Chemicals which disrupt the hormone system \u2013 also known as 'endocrine disrupting chemicals' \u2013 may be a contributing factor behind the significant increases in cancers, diabetes and obesity, falling fertility, and an increased number of neurological development problems. In 2013, the EEA will support \u2018European Year of Air\u2019 with data and analysis. This will feed into the European Commission\u2019s review of air quality legislation.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/eea-reviews-new-findings-from"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0397", "date": "2012-12-20", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Households and industry responsible for half of EU greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels", "text": "The report considers the 40 % of greenhouse emissions originating from energy industries such as heating plants, power stations and refineries. These emissions are then reallocated to the \u2018end-users\u2019 of the energy. The main objective is to help improve the understanding of the demand leading to greenhouse gas emissions. Between 2009 and 2010 fossil fuel combustion was responsible for an increase of over 100 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in the EU, partly due to an economic rebound in many EU Member States. This is reflected in the new EEA analysis. In 2010, approximately 50% of the net increase in energy-related emissions was driven by higher industrial activity, particularly in the iron and steel sector. Another reason for the emissions increase in 2010 was a colder winter, resulting in an increase in a demand for heating. The residential sector represented almost 40% of the net increase in energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, households used more electricity in 2010 compared to 2009, leading to higher emissions. End-use greenhouse gas emissions from energy use in EU\u201127 in 2010 Trends in greenhouse gas emissions by end-use sector in EU-27, 2005-2010 Additional findings In the commercial and residential sectors, indirect emissions are higher than the direct combustion emissions attributed to these sectors. This is largely because of electricity supplied by thermal power stations and district heating (from centralised heating plants) in some areas. In transport, most emissions are emitted directly from the vehicle exhaust pipe, so there is a relatively small change when the indirect emissions are taken into account. Beside the emissions from petroleum refining, other indirect emissions in the transport sector come from power plants which generate electricity used by electric trains. \u2018Other sectors\u2019 include the indirect emissions from imports and exports of energy between countries, for example in the electricity trade. In some EU Member States there is a larger effect than in others, highlighting the relative importance of trade in energy for these countries. These effects can also vary significantly from year to year. The 2012 report includes for the first time information on indirect emissions of two air pollutants, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx) distributed to the end-user sectors. It also provides new diagrams for 27 Member States, Norway and Switzerland. Notes for editors The results in the EEA report are based on the official 2012 greenhouse gas inventory submissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and energy balance data reported to Eurostat. Every year in May the EEA publishes the EU greenhouse gas emissions inventory for the calendar year two years prior to the publication date, or \u2018year x-2\u2019. This follows the final submission of data to the UNFCCC. In early autumn the EEA publishes the proxy greenhouse gas inventory for year x-1. This report gives an early analysis of emissions trends and allows an up-to-date assessment of actual progress towards emission targets. The end-user report is a more recent addition to the EEA\u2019s regular analysis of greenhouse gas trends.

This objective cannot be met with technical improvements alone, it will also require a significant reduction in transport demand and a shift to greener transport modes. EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade The findings come from the EEA report, CO2 emissions performance of car manufacturers in 2011. The EU has a target for the average new passenger car to emit less than 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre (g CO2/km) by 2015. Within this overall target individual manufacturers have specific targets, calculated using the average mass of their fleet. This means that the vehicle fleet can stay diversified by allowing higher emissions from heavier cars than from lighter vehicles. The targets will be gradually phased in to apply to an increasing proportion of cars - 65 % of the fleet is taken into account for 2012 targets, rising to 100 % in 2015. Manufacturers have a long-term target of 95\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km by 2020. According to EU legislation, manufacturers can pool their fleets to receive a collective target, and smaller manufacturers can apply for special derogations. In 2011, 20 derogations were granted and all declared pools were in line with the estimated 2012 targets. Next year the EEA will publish data showing whether the targets were met in 2012. If carmakers do not meet the targets, they will have to pay \u2018excess emissions premiums\u2019. \u201cSome carmakers have made deep efficiency improvements in recent years, showing what is possible,\u201d EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said. \u201cHowever, the transport sector needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 68 % between 2010 and 2050. This objective cannot be met with technical improvements alone, it will also require a significant reduction in transport demand and a shift to greener transport modes.\u201d Key findings All major car manufacturers reduced their emissions between 2010 and 2011. The average EU emissions of all cars registered in 2011 were 135.7 g CO2/km. Only 65% of the least emitting vehicles in each fleet is considered for compliance with the 2012 targets. Total fleet average emissions among the major manufacturers ranged from the Fiat group\u2019s 118\u00a0g\u00a0CO2/km to the highest average level for Daimler, at 153 g\u00a0CO2/km. In 2011 both manufacturers were, nonetheless, below their individual 2012 targets. As in 2010, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd had the lowest average emissions level of the conventional fuelled cars (104 g CO2/km). Of the 20 largest manufacturers in 2011 (see graph below), 18 were within 2012 targets, with the remaining two very close. Five of these manufacturers are also on track to meeting their 2015 target. The EEA figures confirm findings from preliminary data published in June 2012, which showed that new cars in 2011 were on average 3.3 % more efficient than those registered in 2010. A growing proportion of diesel vehicles was partly behind the drop in emissions. Decreasing average engine and vehicle size has been a factor for some manufacturers. While expected to contribute to future greenhouse gas emission reductions, alternative-fuelled vehicles made up a small proportion of new registrations in 2011 and did not significantly influence the overall trend. Registrations of pure electric vehicles remained low with under 9 000 cars registered in the EU, although this was a dramatic increase from the 700 registrations in 2010. In 2011, the number of manufacturers selling only pure electric vehicles increased to four. Above: Distance to 2012 target by individual manufacturers in 2011 (only manufacturers registering >100 000 vehicles in Europe).

The Montreal Protocol is one of the most successful international environmental agreements to date, this example of global action should inspire cooperation on other global environmental problems. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director In the 1970s and 1980s, scientists established that certain man-made chemicals were depleting the ozone in the earth\u2019s stratosphere. This was subsequently confirmed by the finding of abnormally low ozone concentrations above Antarctica \u2013 the so-called \u2018ozone hole\u2019. \u00a0 Stratospheric ozone plays an essential role in limiting the amount of ultraviolet light reaching the surface of the planet, helping prevent skin cancers and other problems such as damage to crops and marine phytoplankton. By signing the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, part of the Vienna Convention for the protection of the Ozone Layer, governments agreed to reduce the production and consumption of ozone depleting substances (ODS). These two treaties are the only agreements in the history of the United Nations to be universally ratified. Within the European Union, companies are obliged to report their use of ODS, including imports, exports, consumption and destruction. In total, 189 companies reported activities involving ODS in 2011. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director said: \u201cThe latest figures show that Europe has effectively addressed the pollution leading to the ozone hole. The Montreal Protocol is one of the most successful international environmental agreements to date, this example of global action should inspire cooperation on other global environmental problems.\u201d\u00a0 Key findings Consumption of ODS in the European Union (EU) is nowadays extremely low compared to past levels. The EU has met the international targets for phasing out consumption in 2010, 10 years ahead of schedule. Production of ODS in the EU has declined steadily since 2006, with a significant dip in 2009 due to the economic crisis. After a partial increase in 2010, production decreased again in 2011. Imports of these chemicals have declined since 2006, although between 2010 and 2011 there was an increase of 5 %, if measured in metric tonnes, or 8.3 % if weighted for their effect on the ozone layer. Almost half came of imports from China, while more than a third came from the United States. Exports have fallen steadily since 2006 at an average rate of 27 % every year. The report finds that this is largely due to declining production and increasing use of the remaining production for \u2018feedstock\u2019 use. In such instances, the chemicals are used to produce non-controlled substances and are not emitted into the atmosphere. Feedstock use of the chemicals is increasing, the report notes, now making up 95 % of the chemicals produced, measured in metric tonnes. Feedstock use is not limited by legislation. Benefits for climate change Many ODS are also potent greenhouse gases, so phasing them out addresses both ozone depletion and climate change. Scientific studies have estimated that the Montreal Protocol \u00a0reduced GWP-weighted ODS emissions globally by around 10-12 Gt CO2-eq per year by 2010. This is 5-6 times more than the reduction of greenhouse gases expected under the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s first commitment period, which is estimated to be 1-2 Gt CO2-eq on average per year between 2008 and 2012, compared to base year emissions. About ozone depleting substances More than 200 chemicals are controlled by the Montreal Protocol. These were formerly mainly used as coolants, propellants in spray cans, blowing agents in making foams, solvents and fire extinguishers. The Montreal Protocol covers over 200 individual ODS, including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). Image above: Maximum ozone hole in 2011.

Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director \u2018European waters \u2013 current status and future challenges\u2019 brings together findings from nine other European Environment Agency (EEA) reports published during the course of 2012 and early 2013. The report shows a mixed picture for the status of Europe\u2019s water bodies, while the findings are worrying when it comes to ecosystems' ability to deliver essential services. Strong ecosystems should be maintained, partly because they provide vital services which are often overlooked, the report says. For example, restoring a wetland is not only good for biodiversity but also water filtration, water retention and flood prevention. Although essential, these services are not accounted for in current financial and economic systems. \u201cWater is finite, and cannot continue to absorb limitless amounts of pollution without damaging the resources and ecosystems we rely on,\u201d Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said. \u201cFarmers, planners and companies need to cooperate more, to make sure that the combined pressures on ecosystems do not pass harmful limits.\u201d Ecosystems are under pressure. Less than half (48 %) of Europe's surface water bodies are likely to be in good ecological status by 2015, as specified by the Water Framework Directive (WFD). To meet this target, water bodies must further reduce nutrient pollution and restore more natural features. The effects of these problems are clear \u2013 63 % of lakes and river habitats in the EU are reported to have an \u2018unfavourable\u2019 conservation status. Modification of water bodies is harming ecosystems. The extent of modification of water bodies \u2013 the \u2018hydromorphological status\u2019 \u2013 is also a problem in 52 % of surface waters. Artificial modifications such as dams or reservoirs can prevent plants and animals from migrating or reproducing. Pollution problems in European waters. Nitrate pollution from agricultural fertilisers is the most long-term pollution problem for European surface waters. At the current rate of improvement, nitrate levels will still be too high for several decades to come, the report notes. Phosphates and ammonia pollution are reducing more quickly, due to better waste water treatment. This improvement is visible in the improving water quality at bathing sites across Europe \u2013 in 2011, 92.1 % of sites met the minimum standards. Agriculture and other sectors are using water inefficiently. Water scarcity is caused by human demands exceeding the available freshwater resources, adding to the \u2018water deficit\u2019 during summer droughts in many parts of Europe. Drought is increasing across Europe. The number of countries affected by drought per decade increased from 15 in the period 1971\u20131980 to 28 in the period 2001\u20132011. Climate change is expected to exacerbate this problem. Flooding is becoming more frequent, especially in Northern Europe. More than 325 major river floods have been reported in Europe since 1980, of which more than 200 have been reported since 2000.This is partly caused by increased building in flood prone areas. Projected climate change is expected to lead to more floods in many areas. Looking ahead to responsive water resources management Solutions to many of Europe\u2019s water problems have been analysed in the European Commission\u2019s Water Blueprint, published in 2012. The EEA report, launched today at the Blueprint conference in Cyprus, underpins the Blueprint\u2019s recommendations and provides a baseline for monitoring progress. New incentives can help Europe reduce the amount of water that is wasted, according to the EEA report. Suggested measures include reconsidering pricing structures for water use or domestic metering. However, incentives introduced with other policy objectives in mind can also encourage wasteful behaviour, for example some governments subsidise water use or encourage water-intense crops in dry areas. Farming remains one of the largest pressures on Europe\u2019s water resources, so agriculture and the food industry are major actors in significantly improving the situation. In the future, payments to farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy should consider their overall effect on water resources, the report says. Energy production is another sector with a high impact on water in Europe. Biofuel production can be water intensive, while hydropower plants often divert water used for other sources. Extracting non-conventional oil and gas resources can also lead to water pollution. Careful planning can balance these demands against the needs of ecosystems, the report says. Overall, river basins need to be further managed with constructive dialogue between the many stakeholders in the area. Public participation and the development of a strong knowledge base are paramount to engage into this dialogue. The report states that the river basin is the best geographical scale for making accurate \u2019water accounts\u2019\u2013 in effect asset management to balance the incoming and outgoing resources. \u00a0Upcoming challenges for water resource management can only be met when water managers have the right information at their fingertips.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/water-management-in-europe-faces"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0404", "date": "2012-11-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Traffic pollution still harmful to health in many parts of Europe", "text": "One of the big challenges of the 21st Century will be to mitigate the negative effects of transport \u2013 greenhouse gases, air pollution and noise \u2013 while ensuring positive aspects of mobility. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The EEA\u2019s annual report under the Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism (TERM) assesses the environmental impact of transport across Europe. There have been some improvements over recent years, although these can be partly attributed to reduced economic activity during the recession. As the economic climate improves, the new EU transport targets should focus efforts to further reduce environmental impacts, the report says. Although air pollution has decreased over the last two decades, it is still a major problem in many areas. \u2018Euro standards\u2019 for vehicles have not succeeded in reducing real NO2 emissions to the levels set out in the legislation although they have made substantial improvements to air quality overall. Increasing transport of goods is also leading to poor air quality. Freight was one of the main causes of the high levels of NO2. Increased shipping over the last two decades has also meant that emissions of acid rain-causing sulphur oxides have only decreased 14 % since 1990, despite major efficiency improvements. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cOne of the big challenges of the 21st Century will be to mitigate the negative effects of transport \u2013 greenhouse gases, air pollution and noise \u2013 while ensuring positive aspects of mobility. Europe can take the lead by intensifying its work in the area of technological innovation in electric mobility. Such change could transform inner city living.\u201d Other trends and findings People living near busy roads across Europe are still particularly exposed to excessive air pollution levels. Harmful nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels above legal limits were registered at 44 % of roadside air monitoring stations in 2010. Particulate matter (PM10) levels exceeded limits at 33 % of these sites. These pollutants can affect the cardiovascular system, lungs, liver, spleen and blood. Europe needs to further reduce the energy consumed by transport, since it was only 4.3 % lower in 2011 than its peak in 2007. Energy use in some transport modes has been strongly influenced by economic fluctuations in recent years. Freight transport demand is particularly sensitive to economic fluctuations. After a sharp drop between 2008 and 2009, it grew 5.4 % in 2010. Passenger transport demand fell almost 1 % between 2009 and 2010. This seems to go against the long-term trend, as passenger transport demand has increased steadily across the EU since records began in the mid-1990s. Private car use has stayed more or less steady, the report says, despite the economic downturn and wide fuel price fluctuations over the last decade. In some cases, prices may be influencing people to make choices which are damaging for the environment. Buying a car has become steadily cheaper in real terms since the mid-1990s, the report notes, while train travel and passenger transport by water has become more expensive. Nonetheless, new cars are becoming more fuel-efficient. The average car sold in 2011 was 3.3% more efficient than the average sold the year before. The transport sector has to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 68 % between 2010 and mid-century to meet the EU target. Greenhouse gas emissions from transport fell by 0.4% between 2009 and 2010, and early estimates show a similar decrease between 2010 and 2011. Noise is another impact from transport which can cause serious health problems. The report finds that in Europe\u2019s biggest cities, three of every five residents are exposed to harmful levels of traffic noise. Even in the countryside, 24 million Europeans are exposed to damaging traffic noise at night. This can cause both physical and psychological problems. More information In December 2012 the EEA will publish new data on the greenhouse gas emissions of new passenger cars. Preliminary data. Transport publications from the EEA European Annual Air Quality Report 2012 Recent greenhouse gas emissions reports", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/traffic-pollution-still-harmful-to"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0405", "date": "2012-11-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Climate change evident across Europe, confirming urgent need for adaptation", "text": "Climate change is a reality around the world, and the extent and speed of change is becoming ever more evident. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The report, \u2018Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe 2012\u2019 finds that higher average temperatures have been observed across Europe as well as decreasing precipitation in southern regions and increasing precipitation in northern Europe. The Greenland ice sheet, Arctic sea ice and many glaciers across Europe are melting, snow cover has decreased and most permafrost soils have warmed.\u00a0 Extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods and droughts have caused rising damage costs across Europe in recent years.\u00a0 While more evidence is needed to discern the part played by climate change in this trend, growing human activity in hazard-prone areas has been a key factor. Future climate change is expected to add to this vulnerability, as extreme weather events are expected to become more intense and frequent. If European societies do not adapt, damage costs are expected to continue to rise, according to the report. Some regions will be less able to adapt to climate change than others, in part due to economic disparities across Europe, the report says. The effects of climate change could deepen these inequalities. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director said: \u201cClimate change is a reality around the world, and the extent and speed of change is becoming ever more evident. This means that every part of the economy, including households, needs to adapt as well as reduce emissions.\u201d Observed climate change and future projections \u2013 some key findings The last decade (2002\u20132011) was the warmest on record in Europe, with European land temperature 1.3\u00b0 C warmer than the pre-industrial average. Various model projections show that Europe could be 2.5\u20134\u00b0 C warmer in the later part of the 21st Century, compared to the 1961\u20131990 average. Heat waves have increased in frequency and length, causing tens of thousands of deaths over the last decade. The projected increase in heat waves could increase the number of related deaths over the next decades, unless societies adapt, the report says. However, cold-related deaths are projected to decrease in many countries. While precipitation is decreasing in southern regions, it is increasing in northern Europe, the report says. These trends are projected to continue.\u00a0 Climate change is projected to increase river flooding, particularly in northern Europe, as higher temperatures intensify the water cycle. However, it is difficult to discern the influence of climate change in flooding data records for the past. River flow droughts appear to have become more severe and frequent in southern Europe. Minimum river flows are projected to decrease significantly in summer in southern Europe but also in many other parts of Europe to varying degrees. The Arctic is warming faster than other regions. Record low sea ice was observed in the Arctic in 2007, 2011 and 2012, falling to roughly half the minimum extent seen in the 1980s. Melting of the Greenland ice sheet has doubled since the 1990s, losing an average of 250 billion tonnes of mass every year between 2005 and 2009. Glaciers in the Alps have lost approximately two thirds of their volume since 1850 and these trends are projected to continue. Sea levels are rising, raising the risk of coastal flooding during storm events. Global average sea level has risen by 1.7mm a year in the 20th century, and by 3mm a year in recent decades. Future projections vary widely, but it is likely that 21st century sea-level rise will be greater than during the 20th century. \u00a0However sea level rise at European coasts varies, for example due to local land movement. Besides heat-related health impacts, other human health effects are also important, the report says. Climate change plays a part in the transmission of certain diseases. For example, it allows the tick species Ixodes ricinus to thrive further north, while further warming may make parts of Europe more suitable for disease-carrying mosquitos and sandflies. The pollen season is longer and arrives 10 days earlier than 50 years ago, also affecting human health. Many studies have measured widespread changes in plant and animal characteristics. For example, plants are flowering earlier in the year, while in freshwater phytoplankton and zooplankton blooms are also appearing earlier. Other animals and plants are moving northward or uphill as their habitats warm. Since the migration rate of many species is insufficient to keep pace with the speed of climate change, they could be pushed towards extinction in the future. While there may be less water available for agriculture in southern Europe, growing conditions may improve in other areas. The growing season for several crops in Europe has lengthened and this is projected to continue, alongside the expansion of warm-season crops into more northerly latitudes. However the yield is projected to fall for some crops due to heat waves and droughts in central and southern Europe. As temperatures rise, demand for heating has also fallen, saving energy. However, this must be balanced against higher energy demands for cooling during hotter summers. Background The report is intended to show the full extent of climate change impacts across Europe, also informing the European Commission\u2019s European Adaptation Strategy to be published in March 2013. Moreover, the EEA will support the strategy with an assessment of a selection of adaptation actions across Europe, to be published in early 2013. The website Climate-ADAPT includes a large amount of information intended to assist in developing and implementing climate change adaptation. The report involved approximately 50 authors.

EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade The report, \u2018European waters - assessment of status and pressures\u2019, published this week by the European Environment Agency (EEA), considers the status of 104 000 rivers, 19 000 lakes, and 4000 transitional and coastal water bodies reported by EU Member States according to the WFD and the river basin management plans (RBMPs). The authors conclude that water bodies are generally improving, but not quickly enough to meet the targets set by the WFD \u2013 in fact only 52 % of water bodies are predicted to achieve good ecological status by 2015, according to Member States own plans. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cEuropean waters have improved a great deal over the last two decades, as legislation has successfully reduced many types of pollution and improved wastewater treatment. But EU Member States look set to miss upcoming targets by a wide margin, so they need to urgently step up efforts to protect both human health and the ecosystems we rely on.\u201d For surface waters, there are two separate classifications: ecological and chemical status. Groundwater bodies are classified according to their chemical status and quantitative status. For a water body to be in overall good status, both types must be at least good. More than half of the surface water bodies in Europe were reported to be below good ecological status or potential status, according to the latest data showing status up to 2009. Many European water bodies remain polluted by excess nutrients, mainly from fertiliser, the report notes. When fertilisers run off from croplands into a water body, it can create eutrophication, a process characterised by increased plant growth and harmful algal blooms, depletion of oxygen and subsequent loss of life in bottom water. Diffuse pollution from agriculture is a significant pressure for more than 40 % of Europe\u2019s water bodies in rivers and coastal waters, and in one third of lakes and transitional waters. Ecological status also includes considerations of \u2018hydromorphology\u2019 \u2013 the extent to which the shape of water bodies and natural flow of the river has been altered. Dams, straightening and dredging alter habitats and damage ecosystems. Hydromorphological pressures resulting in altered habitats is the most common pressure on water bodies, affecting around 40 % of rivers and transitional water bodies and 30 % of the lakes. The report calls for the \u2018re-naturation\u2019 of many water bodies to restore their natural features, such as restoring the natural continuity of rivers. Chemical status refers to levels of heavy metals and other harmful substances. While 10 % of Europe\u2019s surface water bodies are in poor chemical status, there are no chemical status data available for 40 % of Europe\u2019s surface waters. Ground water bodies are in a worse condition \u2013 approximately 25 % of groundwater, by area, has poor chemical status across Europe. Sixteen Member States have more than 10 % of groundwater bodies in poor chemical status. This figure exceeds 50 % in Luxembourg, the Czech Republic, Belgium (Flanders) and Malta. Overall, concentrations of several water pollutants are falling in many river basins. For example, if ammonium and phosphorous levels continue to decline at their current rate, they will be at levels that meet good status by 2015 and 2027 respectively. Nitrates are also falling, although this pollutant will still be too high for several decades at the current rate of decrease, according to the report. The challenges for river basin management are numerous and diverse, the report says. The RBMPs submitted by Member States distinguish between different types of pressures faced by river basins, however they include less detail on how these pressures will be addressed and to what extent selected measures will contribute to achieving environmental objectives in 2015. To maintain and improve the essential functions of our water ecosystems, they need to be managed better, the report says. This can only succeed if an integrated approach is adopted, as introduced in the WFD and related water legislation. All sectors in a river basin need to fully implement the WFD to reduce pressures on water bodies, ensuring all users are committed to healthy water bodies achieving good status. The report is launched to coincide with the launch of the European Commission\u2019s Blueprint to safeguard Europe\u2019s water resources, intended to improve implementation of existing water legislation and show opportunities for further policy improvements.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/more-than-half-of-eu"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0408", "date": "2012-11-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Berlin park wins award for its soundscape design", "text": "Noise pollution is not only a nuisance - it can also affect human health when it increases stress levels or disturbs sleep. Prolonged exposure can even trigger serious illness such as hypertension and heart disease.\u00a0 Across Europe, at least 100 million people are exposed to damaging levels of noise just from road traffic. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that each year Europeans lose at least 1 million healthy life years due to traffic-related noise. Giving people better access to tranquil places can on the other hand enhance mental and physical health and improve quality of life. This year was the second time the EEA and NAS encouraged applications for the European Soundscape Award. The competition was open to any product, campaign, innovation or scheme offering a creative solution to the problem of noise. The organisers received 10 entries spanning 11 countries, covering a wide range of initiatives in the field of noise control or soundscape management.\u00a0 The winner of the European Soundscape Award 2012 A German consortium led by Prof. Dr. Brigitte Schulte-Fortkamp, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin won the European Soundscape Award 2012 for the remodelling of Nauener Platz, a city park in Berlin. The winning project\u00a0had a highly participatory approach, involving residents and people working in the area. Ideas for creating a new attractive park were collected through public discussions and workshops. The people behind the project also organised \u2019sound walks\u2019 to be sure local people\u2019s expertise was considered in the reconstruction of the park\u2019s soundscape. One of their contributions was to identify the areas they felt were most noisy. \u00a0Although traffic can still be heard in Nauener Platz, users feel that the park has a much more pleasant atmosphere. This was achieved by installing devices in sculptures and benches playing recorded sounds of birds and water. The consortium also built a 1.5 m sound barrier made of stone and plants at one side of the park close to playground. Benches for parents were situated directly behind the wall to increase the noise reduction effect. The redesign of the park also included more attractive playgrounds, sports areas and green spaces which increased the lively sounds from human activities. European Soundscape Award 2012 - runner-up prize Estonian NGO \u00d6kokratt won the runner-up prize for its educational project \u2018Noise is not music\u2019. The project aimed to raise awareness of the adverse impacts of noise among children and young people. Approximately 30,000 children from 214 different schools and institutions participated. The project educated 100 teachers about noise and its health impacts. The teachers subsequently planned and implemented a \u2018Silence Week\u2019 at their respective schools and institutions. The multi-faceted project also brought together many other activities involving schoolchildren, including a research project competition, resulting in a play by a theatre group. Several groups also created noise maps and monitored noise levels in their own classrooms (video).\u00a0 Theater play Noise is not music - Theater play The scale of noise meter in kindergarden Young researchers of noise Youth participating in the festival of clean air with popstars Links More information about Nauener Platz in German Good Practice Guide on noise exposure and potentialhealth effects NOISE database Noise Abatement Society", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/berlin-park-wins-award-for"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0409", "date": "2012-11-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU exporting more waste, including hazardous waste", "text": "We should not lose sight of the bigger picture \u2013 in an increasingly resource-constrained world, Europe needs to dramatically reduce the amount of waste it generates in the first place. EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade Increasingly stringent and harmonised waste policies in the EU have led countries to transport more waste material elsewhere, for example if they do not have the facilities to recycle or dispose of particular types of waste. There are increasing demands for recyclable materials, both within the EU and beyond, particularly in booming Asian economies. While trade of hazardous waste grew between 2001 and 2007, shipped volumes decreased in 2008 and 2009, probably due to the economic downturn, according to the report \u2018Movements of waste across the EU's internal and external borders\u2019. Exports of waste plastics and metals picked up again after the economic downturn and exceeded the pre-2009 levels in 2011. The international trade in recyclable material is expected to continue to grow, the report states, driven by more recycling, growing global competition for resources and increasing awareness of the value of waste. Trade in hazardous waste is also expected to increase, although the driver in this case will be the need to treat waste in specific facilities that are not available in all countries. Overall the EU should put more efforts into waste prevention in order to become more resource-efficient, a key element of the EU 2020 growth strategy. The report recommends encouraging new technologies and business models that generate less waste, or waste that is less hazardous. \u201cEuropean countries are exporting more waste than ever,\u201d EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said. \u201cThe trade in non-hazardous waste can be seen as largely positive, as material is often transported to places where it can be better used. However, we should not lose sight of the bigger picture \u2013 in an increasingly resource-constrained world, Europe needs to dramatically reduce the amount of waste it generates in the first place.\u201d Non-hazardous waste Exports of waste iron and steel, and copper, aluminium and nickel from Member States doubled between 1999 and 2011, while waste precious metal exports trebled and waste plastics increased by a factor of five. Increasing export volumes and rising prices are both contributing to the growing economic importance of waste exports. The value of scrap iron and steel exports out of the EU has increased by a factor of eight between 1999 and 2011 to \u20ac18 billion. Waste copper, aluminium and nickel exports expanded by a factor of six and waste precious metals increased by a factor of 15. The value of annual exports to Asia has grown at an even greater rate. \u00a0 Trade in waste wood has also increased steeply. Since 2003, EU imports of waste wood have exceeded exports. Imports of waste wood are primarily driven by the large demand of the particle board industry for wood material. Another demand driver is energy production from solid biomass, which grew by more than 50 % between 1995 and 2008. Transporting non-hazardous waste for recycling can have positive environmental effects overall, the report notes. Although transporting the material causes additional environmental damage and greenhouse gas emissions, these impacts are often much less than the environmental impacts of processing virgin materials. Hazardous and electronic waste Exports of hazardous waste, which may be explosive, flammable, irritative, toxic or corrosive, grew by 131 % in the period 2000\u20132009, while the amount of hazardous waste generated in the EU increased by 28 % in the same period. Flows of hazardous waste into the EU countries, from other EU countries and also from outside the EU, almost trebled between 2001 and 2009, reaching 8.9 million tonnes (Mt). Hazardous waste can include fly ash from incinerators, contaminated soil, lead batteries, waste mineral oils and other chemicals. \u00a0Most hazardous waste exports stay within the EU, going to neighbouring countries. The biggest importer of this material in 2009 was Germany (3 Mt) while the biggest exporter was the Netherlands (2.8 Mt). Most of this material is recycled or used as fuel, although some is still sent to landfill. It is illegal to ship hazardous waste from EU Member States to countries which are not members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Old computers, home appliances and other electronic equipment should be collected separately under EU legislation. However, a large volume of used electrical products are shipped out of the EU to West Africa and Asia, much of them falsely classified as \u2018used goods\u2019 although in reality they are non-functional. The report estimates this trade to be at least 250 000 tonnes every year, possibly much more. These goods may subsequently be processed in dangerous and inefficient conditions, harming the health of local people and damaging the environment. The illegal waste trade seems to be growing, the report says, noting that the EU needs to intensify and harmonise inspection activities across the EU to combat illegal waste transfers.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/eu-exporting-more-waste-including"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0410", "date": "2012-10-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Protected areas have increased to cover one fifth of Europe\u2019s land", "text": "Despite a huge growth in protected areas in recent years, many of Europe\u2019s species still face an uncertain future. Europe as a whole has seen more habitat fragmentation than any other continent. So we need to work harder to conserve species in the wider countryside. EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade A \u2018protected area\u2019 can be any area of land or water designated primarily for nature conservation. There are 105,000 nationally designated protected sites in EEA member and cooperating countries, ranging in size from the 1.3 million hectare (ha) Vatnajokulsthjodgardur National Park in Iceland down to individual trees, such as the Ka\u00e8ja smreka in Godovic, Slovenia. Protected areas are important havens for biodiversity and vital to preserving some of Europe\u2019s most threatened species, according to \u2018Protected areas in Europe \u2013 an overview\u2019, which looks at the status of national parks, nature reserves, biosphere reserves and other protected areas, including the EU\u2019s Natura 2000 network. These areas can place very different limits on human activity. For example, some allow building, fishing and industry, while others are closed to most human intervention. \u201cEurope has a far-reaching network of protected areas which can provide refuge to some of the most threatened species,\u201d EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said. \u201cHowever, despite a huge growth in protected areas in recent years, many of Europe\u2019s species still face an uncertain future. Europe as a whole has seen more habitat fragmentation than any other continent. So we need to work harder to conserve species in the wider countryside.\u201d The EU has a target for 10 % of its seas to be designated as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), although this aim has not yet been achieved. Habitats further out at sea are particularly under-represented in Europe\u2019s protected areas, the report notes. Protected areas in Europe cover a huge variety of natural environments, across eleven distinct biogeographic regions, from the Arctic polar deserts and the boreal forests in the North to the arid or dense mattoral shrubland in the south. Vast tracts of steppe in Eastern Europe contrast with extensive heathlands in the West. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and also the Habitats Directive. The Habitats Directive led to the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, which has been a major driver in creating and maintaining key areas for biodiversity. Biodiversity under pressure The EU aims to halt the loss of biodiversity and degradation of ecosystem services in the EU by 2020, and also work to slow biodiversity loss at the global level. Protected areas are important for meeting this target because they can provide a better environment for wildlife, which is increasingly under pressure in many parts of Europe. The European landscape is increasingly fragmented by roads, railways and towns, blocking migration and dividing species into unsustainably small populations. Between 1990 and 2006, the area of Europe covered by artificial surfaces increased by around 8 %. Most dams prevent migratory fish species from reaching many inland river basins. Agriculture has also intensified in many parts of Europe, leading to increased pollution from nitrates and other substances in some regions. This affects many species of plants and animals which are dependent on low-intensity farming. Other environmental changes come from climate change, invasive alien species, overfishing and pollution. All these pressures can have a cumulative effect, in the worst cases pushing species and ecosystems into irreversible decline. The benefits of protected areas The earliest motives for protecting an area were probably to safeguard its spiritual significance or its importance as a hunting ground. What were once viewed as islands of wilderness are now increasingly perceived as parts of wider networks, involving and benefiting local communities. However, the intrinsic value of preserving nature is still a major motivating factor for setting up protected areas. There are many other benefits of protected areas alongside protecting biodiversity. The report cites many positive side-effects, including economic benefits \u2013 for example, Natura 2000 sites receive between 1.2 and 2.2 billion visitor days every year, generating additional income of \u20ac50-85 billion. Protected areas can also provide health benefits, education opportunities, clean water and air, and tourism. Marine Protected Areas can also increase the yields of nearby fisheries. A recent study by the European Commission estimated that the benefits of the Natura 2000 network to be 3-7 times the cost of setting it up.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/protected-areas-have-increased-to"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0411", "date": "2012-10-18", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Europe still playing catch-up on air pollution, despite reduction successes", "text": "Member States have even further to catch up on air pollution when the latest science is taken into account, showing how important it is that we keep investing in knowledge. EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade The European Environment Agency (EEA) report \u2018Evaluation of progress under the EU National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive\u2019 considers whether the EU has successfully addressed environmental and health objectives set out when the Directive was adopted in 2001. The Directive aimed to reduce acidification of soil and freshwater, to reduce the area of ecosystems with excess nutrient nitrogen (which increase the risk of eutrophication) and to reduce exposure of humans, crops and forests to harmful ground-level ozone. These objectives should have been met by Member States limiting emissions of four important air pollutants by 2010, which would in turn reduce harm to health and the environment to agreed target levels. \u201cWe published a report in June on the NEC Directive, showing that although the legislation has brought down emissions, broadly in line with its original objectives, there are still some problems with attainment,\u201d EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said. \u201cBut the report we are publishing today finds that Member States have even further to catch up on air pollution when the latest science is taken into account, showing how important it is that we keep investing in knowledge.\u201d The ceilings to limit emissions were designed to ensure that the health and environmental objectives were met cost-effectively. There have been significant cuts in air pollutant emissions between 1990 and 2010: sulphur dioxides (-82%), non-methane volatile organic compounds (-56%), nitrogen oxides (-47%) and ammonia (-28%). Nevertheless, twelve EU Member States exceeded at least one of the ceilings agreed for these air pollutants, as documented in a report from the EEA earlier this year. Past and present knowledge lead to different results There are many ways of assessing whether environmental targets have been met. The new EEA report uses two different approaches to ensure that results are both impartial and objective: Past knowledge: an assessment using the tools and approaches from the time the objectives were defined a decade ago. Present knowledge: a state-of-the-art assessment using, as far as feasible, the latest scientific understanding, including an advanced methodology and higher resolution air quality modelling. Using these approaches, it becomes evident that the impacts of air pollutants covered by the NEC Directive are in most cases more serious than would have been evident from using past knowledge alone. Eutrophication: High emissions of nitrogen oxides and ammonia lead to excessive levels of nutrient nitrogen, for example in grasslands, heaths and nutrient-poor lakes. While the objective to reduce areas at risk of eutrophication was met according to past knowledge, present knowledge indicates that eutrophication caused by atmospheric deposition is still a major environmental problem. Source: Areas at risk of eutrophication in 2010 (right) vs 1990 (left) Acidification: The EU has the objective to halve, at least, the areas at risk of acidification\u00a0 between 1990 and 2010. \u00a0Sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ammonia emitted to the air contribute to acidification of water and soil. The objective has been largely met across the European Union if the old methodology is used. The risk of acidification also appears to be markedly reduced when new methods are applied, but there are still many areas of Europe where the acidification objective is not yet met. This is because the more advanced methodology takes into account the specific effects on different ecosystems, for example the higher rate of acid deposition in forests. Ozone: Breathing high levels of ozone can cause respiratory problems and contribute to premature death. The NEC Directive\u2019s objective to reduce human exposure to ozone has been largely met, according to both methodologies, with the exception of some parts of southern Europe, particularly northern Italy. Ozone also damages vegetation, such as crops and forests. According to the modelling results the targets to protect crops were mostly met, even when using the newer methodology, with the exception of Spain and Portugal. \u00a0However, the objective to protect forests was clearly not achieved in most of Europe, with the exception of the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom. While the EEA\u2019s latest report stresses the adverse effects of air pollutants on the environment, a recent EEA assessment of air quality in Europe found that approximately one third of European city dwellers are exposed to pollutants above EU limits to protect health. Next steps The European Commission is currently reviewing the European Union\u2019s air policy. Amongst other initiatives, the Commission is expected to propose a revised NEC Directive in 2013 at the latest, which is likely to set objectives for 2020 and beyond for relevant air pollutants. In the meantime, the NEC Directive remains in force and requires European Union Member States to keep emissions below national ceilings beyond 2010.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/europe-still-playing-catch-up"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0412", "date": "2012-10-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU greenhouse gases in 2011: more countries on track to meet Kyoto targets, emissions fall 2.5 %", "text": "The European Union as a whole will over-deliver on its Kyoto target... Considerable progress has been made since 1997 but all Member States need to deliver on their plans. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The report \u2018Approximated EU greenhouse gas inventory: early estimates for 2011\u2019 gives early estimates of greenhouse gas emissions in the previous year and provides a key input to the report on \u2018Greenhouse gas emission trends and projections in Europe 2012\u2019, which assesses progress against the EU\u2019s commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. \u201cThe European Union as a whole will over-deliver on its Kyoto target\u201d, Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director said. \u201cIn two months\u2019 time we will be at the end of the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol. Considerable progress has been made since 1997 but all Member States need to deliver on their plans. For those EU Member States who have not achieved their target through domestic emission reductions, the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s flexible mechanisms remain available until 2015.\u201d Emissions reductions in 2011 According to EEA\u2019s estimates, the largest relative emissions decreases from 2010 to 2011 were registered in countries with small to medium shares of total EU greenhouse gas emissions: 13\u00a0% in Cyprus, followed by 8\u00a0% in Belgium, Finland and Denmark. The United Kingdom made the biggest emission cuts in absolute terms, with a reduction of 36 million tonnes CO2 equivalent (Mt\u00a0CO2\u00a0eq.) in 2011, or 6\u00a0%. This was followed by France (24\u00a0Mt\u00a0CO2 eq., 5\u00a0%) and Germany (17 Mt\u00a0CO2 eq., 2\u00a0%). Nine EU Member States increased emissions between 2010 and 2011. Bulgaria increased emissions by 11\u00a0%, while Lithuania increased by 3\u00a0% and Romanian emissions rose by 2\u00a0%. However, these countries have made some of the deepest cuts in emissions overall since 1990. Although economic factors played a part in certain countries, it is notable that the EU economy overall grew by 1.5% while emissions fell by 2.5%. Most of the countries registering the deepest cuts in emissions had positive growth in 2011. A warm winter in most countries was a key factor in cutting emissions in 2011, as the demand for fossil fuels for heating was lower than in previous years. The residential and commercial sector \u2013 largely outside the scope of the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) \u2013 contributed most to lower emissions in the European Union. These EEA figures will be further consolidated by mid-2013 in the European Union\u2019s greenhouse gas inventory. The inventory will allow for a detailed analysis of emission trends in EU Member States. European countries closing in on Kyoto targets Emissions outside the EU ETS are important, because changes in these non-trading sectors affect whether countries will meet their targets. Overall emissions from the EU economic sectors not covered by the EU ETS were reduced by approximately 3.0 %, whereas emissions under the EU ETS were cut by 1.8% in 2011. In the 15 Member States with a common commitment under the Kyoto Protocol (EU-15), greenhouse gas emissions from the non-trading sectors decreased rapidly by 3.8% between 2010 and 2011. This emission reduction, in combination with foreseen contributions from carbon sinks and the Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms, confirms that the EU-15 is on track towards over-delivering on its 8\u00a0% reduction Kyoto target. However, for this target to be met all countries will also need to meet individual goals. With emission caps already set for the economic sectors under the EU ETS, the emission reductions of economic sectors outside the EU ETS in 2012 together with the contributions by carbon sinks will ultimately determine how many Kyoto credits Member States will need to acquire to reach their individual targets by early 2015 at the latest. One of the EEA reports shows that some Member States either still need to develop adequate plans on such acquisitions (Italy) or deliver on existing plans (in particular Austria, Belgium, Portugal and Spain). Progress towards 2020 targets The EU has adopted legislation to reduce greenhouse gases by 20 % between 1990 and 2020. The latest figures show emissions in the EU have fallen by 16.5 % and the Union is well on track to meeting this objective. If international aviation is excluded, as is the case with Kyoto Protocol commitments, emissions in the EU have fallen by 17.5% since 1990. Projections from Member States suggest that EU emissions will continue to fall to 19\u00a0% below 1990 levels in 2020, with current policies and measures in place. Less than half of the EU Member States project that their emission levels will fall below their individual 2020 target with only current domestic measures. Although flexibility options allowed under the Effort Sharing Decision could allow Member States to stay on their target paths, most Member States need to step up their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by accelerating the implementation of those additional policies and measures they have already planned.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/eu-greenhouse-gases-in-2011.5"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0413", "date": "2012-09-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Many Europeans still exposed to harmful air pollutants", "text": "In many countries, air pollutant concentrations are still above the legal and recommended limits that are set to protect the health of European citizens.

In fact, air pollution reduces human life expectancy by around two years in the most polluted cities and regions.\" The EEA's 'Air quality in Europe \u2014 2012 report' examines citizens' exposure to air pollutants and provides a snapshot of air quality in Europe. The report is intended to support the development of more effective clean air policies. Key findings \u2022\u00a0 Particulate matter (PM) is the most serious air pollution health risk in the EU, leading to premature mortality. The report estimates that in 2010, 21\u00a0% of the urban population in 2010 was exposed to PM10 concentration levels higher than the most stringent, daily, EU limit value designed to safeguard health. Up to 30\u00a0% of the urban population was exposed to finer PM2.5 concentration levels above the (less stringent) yearly EU limit values. According to the WHO reference levels, which are even tighter than those imposed by EU law, respectively up to 81\u00a0% and 95\u00a0% of urban dwellers were exposed to PM concentrations that exceed the reference values set for the protection of human health \u2013 underlining the urgency of the coming review of air legislation.\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 Ozone (O3) can cause respiratory health problems and lead to premature mortality. Exposure in cities is very high \u2013 97\u00a0% of EU urban inhabitants were exposed to O3 concentrations above the WHO reference level in 2010. 17\u00a0% were exposed to concentrations above the EU target value for O3. In 2009, 22\u00a0% of arable land in Europe was exposed to damaging concentrations of O3, leading to agricultural losses. \u2022\u00a0 Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a major cause of eutrophication (excessive plant and algal growth in water) and acidification, and also contributes to the formation of PM and O3. In 2010, 7\u00a0% of Europeans living in cities were exposed to NO2 levels above the EU limit values. National emissions of nitrogen oxides in many European countries still exceed emission ceilings set by EU legislation and under United Nations agreements. \u2022\u00a0 Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is a carcinogen. A considerable proportion of the urban population in the EU (20-29\u00a0% between 2008 and 2010) were exposed to concentrations exceeding the EU target value, which must be met by 2013. The increase in BaP emissions in Europe in recent years is therefore a matter of concern. \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 Sulphur dioxide (SO2) is a big success story: emissions have been reduced significantly in recent years thanks to EU legislation requiring the use of emissions scrubbing technology and lower sulphur content in fuels. 2010 was the first year that the EU urban population was not exposed to SO2 concentrations above the EU limit value. \u2022\u00a0 Carbon monoxide, benzene and heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, nickel, lead) concentrations in outdoor air are generally low, localised and sporadic in the EU, with few exceedances of the limit and target values set by EU legislation. Next Steps In recent years, the EEA has published annual information on air pollutant emissions and exceedances of emission ceilings under the National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive. Later this year, the EEA will publish a retrospective analysis of whether the health and environmental objectives of the NEC Directive for 2010 have been met. The European Commission is preparing a review of EU air legislation in consultation with stakeholders and will put a particular emphasis on air pollution policies in 2013. Background Poor air quality can cause heart disease, respiratory problems, lung cancer, breathing difficulties and other illnesses. Some pollutants can lead to eutrophication, reduced agricultural crop yields, decreased forest growth and have an impact on the climate. Emissions of several pollutants have fallen in recent years, resulting in improved air quality in some areas. However, they have not always resulted in a corresponding drop of atmospheric pollutant concentrations. The persistent air quality problems require further efforts in mitigating the emissions of several pollutants.

The EEA has now reviewed the successful process which created the indicators in a new report. The report, 'Streamlining European biodiversity indicators 2020: Building a future on lessons learnt from the SEBI 2010 process' summarises achievements to date and is intended to help form the next stage of improving indicators for new biodiversity targets for 2020. The SEBI process started in 2005 as a partnership with a pan-European dimension. Almost 150 experts helped to build a set of 26 indicators which show among other things genetic diversity of domesticated animals, trends in species populations and the extent of selected ecosystems and habitats, including protected areas. Other indicators look at threats to biodiversity and sustainable use of natural resources, funding to protect biodiversity and public awareness of biodiversity issues. \u00a0 The success of the SEBI initiative was largely due to the comprehensive way it brought together existing data and expertise from across Europe, developing a rigorous process for identifying indicators which are most relevant for policy. \u00a0Moreover, the process inspired development of national biodiversity indicator sets in several European countries and other regions of the world. The report argues that the SEBI process is an excellent template for further improvements to biodiversity indicators, allowing us to gain a more detailed and complex understanding of how nature is affected by our heavy footprint. It is only with enhanced information that we can properly direct policy and raise awareness, in order to halt the loss of biodiversity and restore the ecosystems that sustain us.

EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade In 2011, F-gases were used mostly for refrigeration and air-conditioning purposes, as well as in electrical equipment and in the production of foams and aerosols. The new report, compiled by the EEA for the first time in cooperation with the European Commission, presents a summary of the latest data reported under the 'F-Gas Regulation' (No 842/2006) by 120 individual companies that have\u00a0produced, sold, imported or exported F-gases in the European Union (EU). The F-Gas Regulation is one of the main legal instruments with which the EU aims to reduce F-gas emissions by requiring companies to take a range of measures to reduce leaks from equipment containing F-gases and to recover the gases at the end of the equipment's lifetime. Companies are also required to avoid using F-gases for some applications where environmentally superior alternatives are cost-effective. F-gases are important because they contributed 2\u00a0% of total EU-27 GHG emissions in 2010, measured in terms of CO2-equivalent. Moreover, according to the latest official EU greenhouse gas emissions data, their contribution has been steadily growing since 1990. \"Innovation is a key part of tackling climate change and for certain applications, viable alternatives to F-gases already exist,\" EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said. \"This makes them an ideal candidate to replace with less harmful alternatives, in order to limit the growth of emissions\". Key findings Any company producing, importing or exporting more than one tonne of F-gases is required to report data to the European Commission. 120 companies reported production, sales, import or export of F-gases for 2011, an increase of 12\u00a0% on the previous year. In absolute tonnes of gas, there was a decrease in production (-5\u00a0%), imports (-6\u00a0%) and intra-EU sales (-12\u00a0%) of F-gases between 2010 and 2011. Exports increased by 5\u00a0%. When these values are expressed in terms of global warming potential (GWP)-weighted emissions, different patterns emerge due to the large differences in GWP values of certain F-gases. An increase is still evident in exported F-gases (+12\u00a0%), but now also for production (+1\u00a0%). There were decreases in both imports (-8\u00a0%) and sales (-11\u00a0%). Due to its very high global warming potential (GWP), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) makes up a significant proportion of F-gas use when statistics are expressed in terms of CO2\u2011equivalents. This gas is used mainly in electrical equipment. It should be noted that F\u2011gases contained in imported equipment are not captured by the statistics in the report. The European Commission is presently investigating further possible options for strengthening EU measures to reduce emissions of fluorinated gases and intends to present a new legal proposal this autumn. About fluorinated greenhouse gases Three groups of fluorinated greenhouse gases (the so-called 'F-gases') are covered by EU legislation and the UNFCCC Kyoto Protocol: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and SF6. These F-gases have chemical properties which make them useful in different types of products and applications, mainly as substitutes of ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and halons which are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol. The gases are used in a range of applications including refrigeration and air conditioning equipment, for manufacturing electronic goods including semiconductors, and in certain aerosols, foams and fire extinguishing systems. While F-gases do not deplete the ozone layer, they are powerful greenhouse gases typically with long lifetimes in the atmosphere. Their GWP \u2013 the measure indicating the effectiveness of a substance to absorb thermal infrared radiation relative to carbon dioxide (and thus their contribution to climate change) \u2013 can be thousands of times higher than that of CO2.

Based on these EEA estimates, EU 2011 emissions stand approximately 17.5 % below the 1990 level. The EU-15 stands 14.1 % below the base-year level under the Kyoto Protocol. The main reasons for the decrease in emissions were a milder winter in most parts of the EU, which resulted in lower heating demand from households, and reduced natural gas consumption. Renewable energy consumption also continued to increase in 2011, which contributed to the observed decrease in emissions. The economic sectors not covered by the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS) reduced emissions by approximately 3.1 %.\u00a0 The sectors contributing most to lower emissions in the European Union in 2011 were households and the service sector.

The centrepiece of EU water legislation, the Water Framework Directive which is implemented through River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs), takes this element into consideration. However, water basin management should be more closely integrated with spatial planning, the report argues. This would bring a strategic focus to planning, highlighting decisions which affect water resources. The current situation means that costs can fall on those who do not benefit \u2013 for example, water pollution from agriculture in one territory that flows downstream to others. Also, benefits may go to those outside the territory who have not paid for them. An example of this is forests in one territory that regulate floodwaters in a different territory downstream. Water bodies are under pressure in many parts of Europe from multiple demands, including tourism, industry, agriculture, power, transport and public supply. A recent EEA report argued that the natural world also needs water to carry out the 'ecosystem services' which underpin the European economy, such as water purification, soil retention, and food production. By integrating basin-level water management and spatial planning, these direct and indirect human demands can be better weighed up. And it's not just human interests which should be considered. Approximately 250 species of macrophytes and 250 species of fish live in European inland surface waters and a significant number of birds, fish and mammals depend on wetlands for breeding or feeding. These all need sufficient water to survive. In addition, many species also require water bodies to be in a 'natural' state \u2013 for example many species of fish need uninterrupted migratory routes.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/managing-water-and-human-activities-together"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0421", "date": "2012-08-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Avoiding harmful ozone pollution this summer", "text": "To date, the highest concentrations of ozone this summer were on 25 and 26 July in the afternoon and evening. Belgium, western Germany, the Paris region and northern France as well as the north of Italy were particularly affected. Excessive ground-level ozone can cause breathing problems, trigger asthma, reduce lung function and cause lung diseases. The mortality rate rises with increases in ozone exposure, according to\u00a0several European studies.\u00a0Unlike ozone in the stratosphere, which protects us from ultraviolet radiation, high levels of ground-level or \u2018tropospheric\u2019 ozone can also damage plants, reducing crop yields and forest growth, and also damage buildings and monuments. Ground-level ozone is not directly emitted into the atmosphere but is formed from chemical reactions following the release of various \u00a0\u2018precursor pollutants\u2019 from a wide variety of sources: for example, fossil fuel combustion, road transport, refineries, solvents, vegetation, landfills, wastewater, livestock, and forest fires. The reactions that create ozone are catalysed by heat and sunlight \u2013 so it is a particular problem in the summer months, and southern Europe typically has much higher levels of ozone than the north. Staying safe from poor air quality You can find up-to-date information on ground level ozone concentrations across the pan-European region at the EEA\u2019s Ozone Web. The site gives hourly ground level ozone concentrations for the current situation and recent episodes, based on up-to-date measured air quality data. The website provides data from around 2 000 monitoring sites, allowing anyone to check air quality in a specific region or across Europe. Children, the elderly, asthma sufferers and others with respiratory illnesses are most vulnerable. If ozone levels are very high, it is advisable for these groups to avoid spending a lot of time outdoors. Ozone levels are usually higher in the afternoon, so vulnerable people may avoid the higher levels of pollution by working or exercising outdoors in the mornings or evenings. Most Europeans exposed to ozone pollution Although emissions of precursor pollutants have fallen in recent years, the level of ground-level ozone pollution in the air is still quite high. Seventeen per cent of the EU urban population lives in areas where the EU ozone target value for protecting human health was exceeded in 2010. More worryingly, more than 95 % of the total EU urban population is exposed to ozone levels above World Health Organization guidelines. Up to 69 % of agricultural crops in EEA member countries were exposed to ozone levels in excess of the EU target value for protecting vegetation from 2001 to 2009\u00a0(EEA core set indicator 005).

Regulation both in the EU and internationally works when it is properly implemented. The fact that many countries missed their emissions ceilings in 2010 shows we need to continue our efforts to safeguard\u00a0European citizens'\u00a0health. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director \u00a0 In 1999, many of the countries that now comprise the European Union committed to cut emissions of air pollutants under the Gothenburg Protocol of the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention). The EEA's annual \"European Union emission inventory report 1990-2010 under the UNECE LRTAP Convention\" presents a summary of the main emission trends over the past decades. It shows that 11 countries exceeded the 2010 'ceilings' for the four important air pollutants regulated under the Protocol. These pollutants can lead to breathing problems, acid rain and eutrophication. \"In the last two decades we have cut the amount of pollution going into Europe's air,\" EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said. \"Regulation both in the EU and internationally works when it is properly implemented. The fact that many countries missed their emissions ceilings in 2010 shows we need to continue our efforts to safeguard European citizens' health.\" Main findings Among the 11 EU Member States that exceeded the international emissions ceilings, Denmark and Spain exceeded three ceilings (for nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and ammonia (NH3)) while Germany exceeded two ceilings (NOx and NMVOCs). Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden (all NOx) and Finland (ammonia) exceeded one ceiling. Of the main air pollutants, sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions have fallen the most since 1990 (-82 %), followed by carbon monoxide (CO) (-62 %), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) (\u201356 %), nitrogen oxides (NOx) (\u201347 %) and ammonia (NH3) (\u201328 %). Emissions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have fallen by 15 % since 2000. Road transport, households, electricity generating plants, agriculture and certain industry sectors are collectively\u00a0the most important sources of\u00a0several different pollutants. Despite long-term downward trends, in 2010 Member States\u00a0reported increased emissions of many heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants compared to 2009 \u2013 for example, lead increased by 9.1 %, cadmium by 7.5 %, arsenic by 4.9 % and chromium by 12.6 %. These increases were partly due to growing emissions from households and certain industrial sectors. Big cuts in air pollutant emissions over two decades A combination of different measures have reduced emissions of SOx by 82 % between 1990 and 2010. This success can be attributed to desulphurisation technology installed in many industrial sources, and EU directives which led to sulphur reduction in some liquid fuels. This cut is also partly due to power stations and industry switching from high sulphur-containing solid and liquid fuels to low-sulphur fuels such as natural gas. Emissions of NOx have almost halved between 1990 and 2010. The 47 % reduction of NOx emissions over this period was largely due to the introduction of the three-way catalytic converter in petrol vehicles, as well as reductions from industry as a result of tighter controls on emissions. Together with NOx, emissions of two other main air pollutants responsible for the formation of harmful ground-level ozone have dropped significantly since 1990. Carbon monoxide fell by 62 %, NMVOCs fell by 56 %. This improvement was also helped by\u00a0improved vehicle catalysts in road transport. The agricultural sector is responsible for the vast majority of ammonia emissions \u2013 94 % in 2010. NH3 fell by 28 % between 1990 and 2010, although the most reductions occurred in the early 1990s and emissions have since been rather stable. The largest reductions have been reported by Poland, the Netherlands and Germany. All other countries except Cyprus and Spain also reported decreases. The report attributes reductions in\u00a0ammonia emissions largely to better animal manure and fertiliser management techniques. Background The Gothenburg Protocol of the UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) Convention sets emission ceilings for four pollutants (NOx, NMVOC, SOx and NH3) to be achieved by 2010. The Gothenburg Protocol has been signed by most of the European Union Member States (excluding Estonia and Malta), and by EEA member countries Norway and Switzerland. In May 2012 the protocol was amended to include, amongst other changes, new emission reduction commitments for 2020 for NOx, NMVOC, SOx, NH3 and also PM2.5. The amended protocol has not yet entered into force. For the EU Member States, the 2010 ceilings set by the National Emissions Ceilings (NEC) Directive are either equal to or more ambitious than the Gothenburg Protocol's ceilings. For both, countries must also meet the ceilings in each year after 2010. However, reporting by Member States under the Gothenburg Protocol and the NEC Directive can differ. For example, some countries choose to report emissions from additional sources under the Gothenburg Protocol, leading to more sources than those submitted\u00a0under the NEC Directive. This explains for example why Denmark exceeds its emission ceilings for NMVOC and NH3 under the Gothenburg Protocol but not under the NEC Directive as was documented in EEA's recent NEC Directive status report. Moreover, a number of countries have reported more recent data under the Gothenburg Protocol than were available when EEA's assessed the emissions data reported under the NEC Directive. In the case of Finland, updated emissions data for 2010 are below\u00a0 their Gothenburg Protocol emission ceilings and in contrast to the earlier results presented in the NEC Directive status report, are also now lower than their NEC Directive ceiling for that year.

Better access to information like this can help us use our finite water resources most wisely Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The EEA Catchments and Rivers Network System (ECRINS) is a dynamic set of map layers displaying the location and characteristics of hydrological features such as lakes, dams, abstraction points as well as monitoring stations and sewage treatment plants. It covers river catchment information over the previous ten years. The maps directly support environmental analysis such as water accounts and policy-making. For example, one layer delineates all river catchments, which is useful for those working to implement the European Union\u2019s Water Framework Directive (WFD) at the river basin level. The ECRINS package is a public good, so is available to anyone, including European institutions, national water agencies, scientists, businesses, students and NGOs active in environmental assessments. Users need GIS (Geographic Information System) software to access the map layers. The ECRINS layers can be combined with others, such as those focusing on population or agriculture, to build an increasingly detailed picture of the influences on Europe\u2019s water resources. It is hoped that this will allow users to answer a number of different questions, such as 'How many people live upstream of this lake?', 'What is the flow discharge at this point?', 'How many cubic metres of water are abstracted to irrigate fields?', 'What is the annual water balance for this basin?', 'What is the length of accessible rivers below that dam?' \u201cThe ECRINS map layers will be an extremely important tool for understanding water resources in Europe,\u201d EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said. \u201cThe maps cover the EU and EEA member countries, and include data from many others \u2013 in fact covering 70 % of rivers in 10 million km2 of river basins across continental Europe and the Middle East.

The CCM has been completed with other layers with a resolution between 1:100 000 and 1:500 000. The geographical coverage of ECRINS goes beyond EU-27 and the EEA Member countries. All of continental Europe west of the Urals, the Caucasus region and the Tigris-Euphrates river system is catalogued. It includes an improved catalogue of names, meaning that particular river systems with several local names may be easier to find. The layers are available as Geodatabase files which can be opened with well-known programmes such as Microsoft Access and ArcGIS.

But this analysis shows that authorities should make extra efforts to reduce the air pollution they can control, because the cumulative effect of natural and man-made particulates can damage people's health. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The report is the first evaluation of Member State reporting under the EU's Air Quality Directive. The directive sets legally binding limit values to improve air quality. However, countries can subtract the pollution from natural sources, as they are only obliged to reduce man-made air pollutant emissions. So the report also includes European Union (EU) Member States documentation of natural contributions which led to exceedances of air quality limit values set by EU legislation. It is difficult to calculate the exact amount of pollutants emitted from natural sources, the report notes, but in many countries the contribution to particulate matter levels in the air can be significant. The most common natural sources of particulate matter in Europe are desert dust, volcanoes, forest and grassland fires, and salt from sea spray. The particular source of pollution can be identified using various methods including chemical analysis of particles sampled from the air, meteorological data satellite measurements and modelling. Eleven EU Member States reported that natural sources pushed particulate matter concentrations over the limit values in 2008 or 2009 (Austria, Cyprus, Germany, Greece, France, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom). The highest numbers of cases were reported by Mediterranean countries (Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy and Spain). Spain had the highest number of measuring stations reporting exceedances caused at least in part by natural sources. \"Poor air quality from natural sources is by definition outside of our control,\" EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said. \"But this analysis shows that authorities should make extra efforts to reduce the air pollution they can control, because the cumulative effect of natural and man-made particulates can damage people's health.\" Natural sources of particulate matter 'African dust' from the Sahara is the most common natural source of particulate matter in the air. In the Western and particularly in the Eastern Sahara rainfall is extremely rare and irregular. Temperatures can rise above 50\u00b0 C during the summer months. Extremely dry and hot conditions create turbulence during the day which can propel dust upwards to a height of 4-5km. Such turbulence is usually followed by meteorological stability during the night. Particles can stay at these heights for weeks or months, and are often blown across Europe. Sea spray is also a source of particulate matter, and can contribute up to 80 % of particle levels in the air in coastal areas. This is mostly salt, whipped into the air by strong winds. The sudden eruption of a volcano, for example on Iceland or in the Mediterranean, has the potential to produce transient peaks of airborne particulate matter in Europe. Forest and grassland fires in Europe burn an average of almost 600 000 hectares of land per year, a significant source of air pollution. It is difficult to determine whether these fires are truly 'natural sources' \u2013 the report notes that approximately nine out of 10 fires are caused directly or indirectly by humans, for example by arson, discarded cigarettes, campfires\u00a0 or farmers burning crop residues after the harvest.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/sahara-dust-sea-spray-and"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0427", "date": "2012-06-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Copenhagen beats Bristol and Frankfurt to win European Green Capital 2014", "text": "The jury assessed three different areas. They considered cities\u2019 overall environmental commitment, vision and enthusiasm. Cities also had to demonstrate that they had communicated these issues to their citizens and with other local groups. Lastly, the jury also considered how each city could act as a role model for other cities with similar conditions. The jury noted that Copenhagen is an excellent role model for its approach to urban planning. In 2010, 35 % of citizens were already cycling to their place of work or education, which the municipality hopes to increase to 50% in 2015, contributing towards the ambitious goal of becoming CO2 neutral by 2025. Other plans to reduce emissions include using more sources of renewable energy for the city\u2019s existing district heating system. Environmentally-conscious planning has been demonstrated to have many health benefits. Copenhagen now has an official municipal policy stipulating that by 2015 all citizens should be able to reach a park or beach on foot in less than 15 minutes. In line with this policy, several new parks are under development in areas lacking green spaces. The Danish capital has worked with green companies, universities and organisations in order to boost eco-innovation and sustainable employment. Successful communication efforts mean the environment is not just seen as a municipal concern, according to the jury, Copenhageners feel they are part of the solution. Frankfurt, as one of the runners-up, has also achieved a great deal, according to the jury. Total volumes of waste have been decreasing for years. Environmental campaigns in areas like water and electricity have also led to reductions in water and electricity consumption beyond the national average. The Jury was impressed by Frankfurt's commitment to improve energy efficiency with a range of policies. All new buildings in Frankfurt must be \u2018passive\u2019, i.e. meet strict standards for energy use. The city is bringing in an ambitious Green Public Procurement policy, especially in the building sector. Frankfurt banned the use of tropical timber in 1999 and the use of PVC is also forbidden. Bristol has ambitious targets to cut CO2, which go further than those of the EU and UK. The city aims to reduce emissions by 40% by 2020 and by 80% by 2050 from a 2005 baseline. Another commendable example was Bristol's policy on clean air and noise: the city has one of the most comprehensive air quality monitoring networks in the UK and has plans to manage transport to further improve the situation. The jury noted that the city has mobilised many thousands of people through volunteering schemes, e-petitions, online discussions and collaborations with many different community organisations. Cities and the environment Approximately three quarters of Europeans live in cities. The high concentration of people in urban areas can put intense pressures on the local environment. Cities also affect the environment much further afield \u2013 the average urban lifestyle in Europe directly and indirectly uses water, energy, resources and land. One study of Greater London estimated London\u2019s environmental footprint to be 300 times its geographical area \u2014 corresponding to nearly twice the size of the entire UK. However, the three Green Capital Award finalists all demonstrate that cities are also places where it is possible to make big environmental gains. For example, the high concentration of people and services means that public transport often works very efficiently, while people are more likely to cycle or walk to their local shops instead of driving. Per capita energy use is usually lower in city apartment blocks compared to dispersed rural dwellings. Cities are also engines of cultural, financial and intellectual activity, driving new innovations which are essential for responding to Europe\u2019s environmental challenges. But Europe\u2019s cities are also vulnerable to environmental shocks. A recent European Environment Agency report explored the risks from climate change, finding city dwellers were particularly vulnerable to some risks such as heatwaves and urban flooding.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/copenhagen-beats-bristol-and-frankfurt"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0428", "date": "2012-06-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Nitrogen oxide emissions still a major problem in Europe", "text": "As emissions can rebound during periods of economic recovery, countries need to make positive efforts to limit any increase of emissions in the future. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director Under the NEC Directive, countries were obliged, by 2010, to meet \u2018ceilings\u2019 for four important air pollutants: nitrogen oxides (NOX), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and ammonia (NH3). These pollutants are harmful to both people and the environment, causing respiratory illnesses, acidifying soil and surface water, and damaging vegetation. Since 2001, Member States have been working towards meeting these ceilings. Today\u2019s publication of official 2010 data from Member States is the first time that those efforts can be measured against the legally binding targets. The findings, based on official preliminary data for 2010 reported by Member States, confirm EEA\u2019s early analysis made in February 2012. Final emissions data for 2010 will be reported by countries at the end of this year. \u201cAll these pollutants contribute to poor air quality, which damages people\u2019s health and the environment,\u201d EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said. \u201cWe should also note that 2010 was a recession year in much of Europe. As emissions can rebound during periods of economic recovery, countries need to make positive efforts to limit any increase of emissions in the future.\u201d Key findings Nitrogen oxide (NOx) limits were exceeded most frequently, with 12 Member States failing to keep emissions below agreed ceilings. These were Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. Road transport contributes approximately 40 % of total NOx emissions in the EU. Reductions of NOX from this sector over the last two decades have been lower than originally anticipated, according to the report. This is partly because transport has grown more than expected, and partly because the real-world emissions from diesel vehicles are higher than those estimated when the vehicle emission limit standards were set. A lot of progress has been made in\u00a0reducing sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions in recent decades. SO2 emissions in the EU were more than 40% below the EU\u2019s ceiling for this pollutant, and no Member States exceeded their SO2 ceiling. Spain was the only Member State to report exceeding three of its four emission ceilings (NOX, NMVOC, NH3), followed by Germany (NOX, NMVOC) and Finland (NOX, NH3) with two exceedances each. The EU also has\u00a0emissions ceilings under the NEC Directive, one being the sum of the individual Member States\u2019 ceilings for each pollutant, while the second\u00a0is a\u00a0stricter,\u00a0specific ceiling for the EU as a whole. Of these, the two EU ceilings for NOx were both exceeded, albeit the first by only a small margin.\u00a0 Coming up\u2026 During summer 2012, the EEA will publish data presenting long term emission trends of air pollutants within the EU\u2019s annual report to the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP). Later in the year the EEA will also publish a separate analysis showing to what extent the original objectives in the NEC Directive \u2013 \u00a0protecting human health and environment \u2013 have been achieved. The European Commission is currently reviewing the European Union\u2019s air quality policy, and, amongst other initiatives, is expected to propose a revised NEC Directive in 2013 at the latest. A revised directive will build on the findings of the policy review and is likely to set objectives for 2020 and beyond for relevant air pollutants. \u00a0In the absence of new legislation, however, the NEC Directive remains in force and requires countries to keep emissions below national ceilings in the years beyond 2010.

Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA On Friday 22 June, heads of state and government signed an agreement on sustainable development called \u2018The Future We Want\u2019. This was not as ambitious as the EU had been pressing for and did not include detailed Sustainable Development Goals with fixed deadlines or numbers. Nonetheless, the European Union (EU) managed to get some goals into the final text. It is hoped that these preliminary targets will form the basis for further negotiation within the UN. On the proposal to make the United Nations Environment Programme a full UN organisation (in line with the World Health Organisation and others) it was instead agreed to strengthen UNEP. This includes universal membership of UNEP \u2013 meaning that all countries are now UNEP members. Another notable step in the right direction was the adoption of the global 10-year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production. The UN failed to reach agreement in this area in 2011. The agreement also noted the importance of \u2018green economy\u2019, an important objective for EU negotiators during the Rio+20 summit: \u2026we consider green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication as one of the important tools available for achieving sustainable development and that it could provide options for policy making but should not be a rigid set of rules (paragraph 56).

It is also encouraging to see sales of electric cars starting to climb. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA There were 12.8 million new vehicles registered in the EU in 2011. The average CO2 emissions for these cars was 135.7 grams CO2 per kilometre, which is 4.6g CO2/km less than in 2010 \u2013 a reduction of 3.3 %. A combination of changes in buying behaviour, improved technology and engine efficiency was mostly responsible for this reduction, according to EEA analysis. In addition, the long-term reduction of emissions has been influenced by an increasing uptake of diesel cars, an ongoing trend which continued in 2011. The gap between average CO2 emissions of new diesel and petrol vehicles has been narrowing in recent years \u2013 in 2011 it was just 3.2g CO2/km. In 2011, 55.2 % of the vehicles registered in 2011 in Europe were diesel vehicles, an increase from 51.3% in 2010. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA said: \u201cWe can see new cars becoming more efficient year-on-year \u2013 a good example of regulation helping industry to make real improvements. It is also encouraging to see sales of electric cars starting to climb.\u201d In the EU, CO2 emissions from road transport have increased by 23 % between 1990 and 2010, becoming responsible for approximately one fifth of the EU's total emissions. In order to cut greenhouse gas emissions from transport, carmakers have a collective target for the average car sold in the EU to emit a maximum of 130g CO2/km by 2015 and 95g CO2/km by 2020. Last year the EEA reported that manufacturers had some distance to go to meet the 2015 target. \u00a0However, on present trends, the industry as a whole is on track to meeting the 2015 CO2 target. The preliminary figures will now be verified by car manufacturers before they are confirmed by the European Commission later this year. Other findings Registration of new cars in the EU increased constantly between 2001 and 2007, peaking at 15.5 million cars, but has fallen continuously since. Between 2010 and 2011 the number of new car registrations increased in many Member States, notably Latvia (71%), Lithuania (68%) and Estonia (66%) , but fell in others, including Greece (-31 %), Portugal (-31%) and Spain (-17 %). The mass of new cars increased slightly in 2011 and is now back to the level seen in 2007 before the economic crisis. Nonetheless, engine capacity, measured in cm3, has decreased by 5 % compared to 2007. Registrations\u00a0of vehicles using liquefied petroleum gas fell by 76% between 2010 and 2011. This was mostly due to a sharp decline in uptake in France and Italy, countries where this fuel is most commonly used. There were 8,700 pure electric cars\u00a0registered in 2011. While this number is only 0.07 % of new cars registered, so did not significantly influence the EU average emissions, it is a 10-fold increase on 2010.\u00a0 Portugal, Malta and Denmark had registered the most carbon-efficient cars on average, with emissions of 125g CO2/km or less. At the less efficient end of the spectrum, new cars registered in Estonia, Latvia and Bulgaria had more than 150g CO2/km on average.

Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director In the 20-year gap between the two Rio summits, the earth's population has grown from 5.4 billion in 1992 to more than 7 billion now \u2013 a leap of almost 30 %. This has had a knock-on effect on global use of natural resources, in tandem with increasing per capita consumption levels. Although greenhouse gas emissions have fallen within Europe, globally they have jumped by approximately a third over 20 years, and the number of tonnes of natural resources extracted has also leapt by a third in the same period. These figures mask huge inequalities \u2013 per capita resource use and emissions are many times higher in some countries compared to others. Many critics of the current economic model point out that it is premised on ever-increasing exploitation of natural resources, while materials and the planet's capacity to absorb waste are limited. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director said: \"The current economic model is heading toward obsolescence.

Changing this will be very difficult \u2013 environmentally harmful patterns of consumption are deeply ingrained in our society - economically, politically, socially and technically. EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade Just three areas are estimated to be responsible for approximately three quarters of the environmental impacts from household consumption. These areas are eating and drinking; housing and infrastructure; and mobility, contributing 74 % of greenhouse gas emissions, 74 % of acidifying emissions, 72 % of tropospheric ozone precursor emissions and 70 % of the direct and indirect material input caused globally by private consumption in 2007 in the EU-27 Member States. There are some positive trends \u2013environmental impacts from European consumption are falling for three of the four environmental issues studied in the report. However, current levels of environmental damage are still unsustainable, and material resource use is still growing. \u201cWe can foresee multiple, converging environmental crises caused by our unsustainable consumption,\u201d EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said. \u201cChanging this will be very difficult \u2013 environmentally harmful patterns of consumption are deeply ingrained in our society - economically, politically, socially and technically. But it is not impossible. We need policies that make sustainable choices easy, affordable and attractive, business models that drive forward sustainable consumption patterns, and people to make the sustainable choices.\u201d Goods and services consumed in Europe are increasingly imported. Since the majority of environmental impacts from consumption are created during the production of the goods, a considerable share of the environmental pressures is actually felt outside of Europe, according to the report \u2018Consumption and the environment\u2019. This is a newly updated chapter of the EEA\u2019s State and Outlook of the Environment Report (SOER) 2010 that is launched today at the Global Research Forum on Sustainable Consumption and Production in Rio de Janeiro. Climate change, eutrophication, air pollution and acidification are all driven by personal consumption, the report says. Increasing population is also influencing these issues, but a bigger driver is the \u2018consumer class\u2019 around the world which is predicted to grow to 1.2 billion people by 2030. Efficiency gains partly offset by growing consumption Efficiency measures have successfully reduced key emissions to air caused by household consumption in the EU-27 between 2000 and 2007. However, growing consumption and changes in consumption patterns have partly offset these gains. In addition, more efficient use of materials has even been outpaced by growth in consumption. So improving efficiency alone is not enough, the report says \u2013 in the past more efficient use of resources has often resulted in the \u2018rebound effect,\u2019 where financial savings from increased efficiency are used for additional consumption of goods and services \u2013 so the environmental benefit is negated. For example, energy efficiency of housing has improved since 2000, but this trend has been largely offset by an increase in housing space per person. Transport impacts are also getting worse. While the fuel efficiency of the average car has been improved continuously in recent decades, the improvements have been more than offset by growing demand for travel by private car in the EU. Changing the economics of consumption Current consumption patterns damage the environment and over-use resources, in part because the environmental cost of producing goods and services is not fully reflected in their price. This means that many goods are relatively cheap even though they cause major harm to the environment, ecosystems or human health. Many economic systems also create perverse incentives to consume more. Some governments subsidise new purchases or environmentally damaging goods such as fossil fuels, prioritising short-term economic gain, thereby accelerating environmental damage. Environmental Tax Reform (ETR) is one area which could improve the relationship between consumption and the environment. Proponents of ETR argue that it is important to tax environmentally-damaging activities. The taxes could then be redistributed to people via reductions in income tax. Shifting tax from labour to emissions and resource use in this way may reduce unsustainable consumption. Nonetheless, it will be impossible to substantially reduce environmental impacts of consumption without a change in culture, the report says. Many millions of people around the world currently aspire to drive a car or own the latest electronic device. The expanding nature of consumption means that these products cannot simply be \u2018greened\u2019 with technical improvements, instead culture needs to make a larger shift. Global policies towards more sustainable consumption and production patterns are currently being negotiated in the Rio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development.

It states that Europe is using resources more efficiently, though it has used increasing volumes of raw materials in absolute terms. While this trend has been interrupted by the economic downturn, it is likely that increasing resource consumption will resume with renewed economic growth. Using material resources more efficiently - from virgin materials\u2026 Average annual use of material resources is nearly 15 tonnes per person. The bulk of this ends up as \u2018stuff\u2019 accumulated in the economy; the rest is converted into emissions or waste. Europe's economy is heavily dependent on imported raw materials \u2014 in 2011 approximately 1 600 million tonnes of raw materials were imported into Europe \u2013 that\u2019s about 3.2 tonnes per person. Fuels accounted for most of this amount. Targets set in the recent past have not always been met: the EU was expecting to become 'the most resource\u2011efficient economy in the world' and 'substantially reduce waste generation', according to the Sixth Environment Action Programme (6EAP) adopted in 2002, but this has only been partially successful. The EU\u2019s Europe 2020 strategy, adopted in 2010, identified resource efficiency as one of its main goals, and it is hoped that this will revitalise efforts to develop an economy which is competitive, inclusive and provides a high standard of living with much lower environmental impacts. These ambitious goals can only be achieved with considerable changes in production and consumption patterns. \u2026 to waste The European economy \u00a0generates more than five tonnes of waste, including hazardous waste, per inhabitant each year, and each citizen throws on average half a tonne of household waste into the bin. Nonetheless, there has been a slight reduction in waste volumes in recent years, probably connected to the downturn. Moreover, waste management in Europe has improved. Recycling rates for municipal waste have more than doubled in the area of the EU plus Norway and Switzerland, going from 17 % of municipal waste recycled or composted in 1995 to 38 % in 2010. Approximately 60 % of packaging waste is now recycled. The EU aims to become a 'recycling society' as part of a greener economy which provides both better resource efficiency and improved security of supply. Recycling already covers a large share of EU consumption of certain materials, especially paper and cardboard, iron and steel but is below 10% for others such as copper, concrete and plastics. Better collection schemes and recycling infrastructure could lead to more recycled materials in new products. There are several side benefits from better waste management. For example, full implementation of the EU Landfill Directive\u2019s targets, via using municipal waste as resource instead of sending it to landfill could cut greenhouse gas emissions by 62 million tonnes of CO2\u2011equivalent in 2020 compared to 2008, according to analysis carried out by the EEA . Increasing recycling also creates more jobs at higher income levels : overall employment related to recycling increased by 45 % in Europe between 2000 and 2007. Resource efficiency and Rio+20 Efficient use of materials, reducing waste, and using waste as a resource are important pillars of a \u2018green economy,\u2019 set to be a key theme at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June this year.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/europe2019s-demand-for-resources-reaching"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0434", "date": "2012-06-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "World remains on unsustainable path \u2013 UNEP report on eve of Rio+20 Summit", "text": "With clear progress in only four of 90 environmental areas, we are certainly heading in a very dangerous direction. However, the report also shows that in a few areas, international agreements have been very successful. We must learn from these successes, and use the Rio+20 Summit to take action on these accelerating trends of environmental destruction. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The fifth edition of the Global Environmental Outlook (GEO-5) report, launched on the eve of the Rio+20 Summit, assessed 90 of the most-important environmental goals and objectives and found that significant progress had only been made in four. These areas of progress were: eliminating the production and use of substances that deplete the ozone layer, removal of lead from fuel, increasing access to improved water supplies and boosting research to reduce pollution of the marine environment. Some progress was shown in reaching 40 of the goals, including the expansion of protected areas such as national parks and efforts to reduce deforestation. Little or no progress was detected for 24 goals \u2013 including climate change, fish stocks, and desertification and drought. Further deterioration was posted for eight goals including the state of the world\u2019s coral reefs, while no assessment could be made of 14 other goals due to a lack of data. Europe has particularly unsustainable levels of consumption, the report notes, which is driving many of these problems. Nonetheless, it highlights some successes in Europe including cutting carbon emissions. The report cautions that if humanity does not urgently change its ways, several critical thresholds may be exceeded, beyond which abrupt and generally irreversible changes to the life-support functions of the planet could occur. For example, at the regional scale, freshwater lake and estuary ecosystems can collapse abruptly due to eutrophication; at the global level an abrupt and irreversible example of change could be the melting of the Arctic ice-sheet due to an amplification of global warming \u201cWith clear progress in only four of 90 environmental areas, we are certainly heading in a very dangerous direction,\u201d Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency said. \u201cHowever, the report also shows that in a few areas, international agreements have been very successful. We must learn from these successes, and use the Rio+20 Summit to take action on these accelerating trends of environmental destruction.\u201d The Summit in Rio could mark a turning point - the report says it is possible to meet an ambitious set of sustainability targets by the middle of the century if current policies and strategies are changed and strengthened. GEO-5 also points out that where international treaties and agreements have tackled goals with specific, measurable targets\u2014such as the bans on ozone-depleting substances and lead in petrol\u2014they have demonstrated considerable success. For this reason, GEO-5 calls for more specific targets, with quantifiable results, across a broader range of environmental challenges. The report also calls for a greater focus on policies that target the drivers of environmental change \u2013 such as population growth and urbanisation, unsustainable consumption patterns, fossil fuel-based energy consumption and transport, as well as globalisation. In particular, globalisation has made it possible for intense pressures to be concentrated in specific parts of the world very quickly, as in the case of increased demand for biofuels leading to land clearance and conversion. Although reducing the drivers of environmental change directly may appear politically difficult, the report claims that it is possible to obtain significant indirect benefits by targeting more expedient objectives, such as international goals on human well-being.

EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade Signals is an annual publication which aims to explain complex environmental issues for a non-expert audience. The 2012 edition explores the environmental impacts of our consumption and production patterns, and ways these can be changed to reduce their effect on the environment. This subject was chosen because it is a significant component of a \u2018green economy\u2019, one of the main focuses of the Rio+20 sustainable development Summit which will take place in Rio de Janeiro later this month. \"Almost all environmental problems, from climate change to the extinction of species, can be traced back to the way we consume natural resources,\" EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said. \"Europe is currently at a turning point, where we have the opportunity to move towards a more equitable, greener economic model. Changing the way we live, produce and consume will open a whole world of new opportunities.\" One story explores what cotton cultivation in Burkina Faso means for the rest of the economy and the society as a whole. Cotton cultivation requires large volumes of water and the pesticides can harm the workers. The report asks: Do the shelf prices of textiles we consume in Europe reflect the environmental costs of cotton production in Burkina Faso? Another story draws the links between consumption of electronic gadgets and environmentally damaging mining around the world. The report also looks into waste and recycling as other stages in the lifecycles of many of the products we buy. The current economic system prioritises short term gain, risking the natural systems which underpin the economy, while a more equitable, greener economic model would help ensure Europe\u2019s long-term prosperity, the report says. The report argues that sustainability is ultimately a matter of choices: policy choices, business choices and consumer choices. Global supply chains mean that the decisions of manufacturers, retailers and consumers in Europe can significantly affect the lives of people as far away as Burkina Faso. Consumer choices can generate employment and earnings, but can also lead to over\u2011exploited water resources and poisoned local people and ecosystems.

This rebound effect was expected as most of Europe came out of recession. However, the increase could have been even higher without the \u00a0fast expansion of renewable energy generation in the EU. EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the 27 Member States of the European Union (EU-27) increased by 2.4 % (or 111 million tonnes CO2 equivalent) between 2009 and 2010. This can be partially explained by the fact that there was a sharp 7.3% (or -365 million tonnes) decrease of emissions between 2008 and 2009. The EU remains fully on track to meet its Kyoto target. The long-term reduction trend continued, since EU-27 greenhouse gas emissions still remained 15.4 % below 1990 levels in 2010. Emissions in the 15 Member States with a common commitment under the Kyoto Protocol (EU-15) in 2010 were 11 % below the Kyoto Protocol base year. These consolidated figures confirm earlier estimates for the EU, published by the EEA in October 2011. \u201cEmissions increased in 2010. This rebound effect was expected as most of Europe came out of recession,\u201d EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said. \u201cHowever, the increase could have been even higher without the fast expansion of renewable energy generation in the EU.\u201d Why were greenhouse gas emissions higher? Higher emissions were partly due to the economic recovery (GDP grew by 2 % in the EU in 2010), as many European countries emerged from the 2009 recession. Higher final energy demand (+3.7 % in 2010) also contributed to the emissions growth. Moreover, the winter in 2010 was colder than in the previous year, leading to higher heating demand. However, GHG emissions growth was contained by several factors. As in previous years the growth in the use of renewable energy sources continued in 2010 with a 12.7% increase of total consumption of energy from renewable sources. In addition, gas prices fell markedly in 2010 and EU total consumption of gas used for energy purposes went up by 7.4%. The higher share of gas led to an improved carbon intensity of fossil fuel consumption in many Member States. Other findings Emissions were higher in most of the key sectors in 2010, particularly those sectors relying on fossil-fuel combustion. Sectors with the highest GHG emissions growth included: CO2 emissions from residential and commercial sectors (caused by a higher heating demand due to a colder winter); CO2 emissions from manufacturing industries and construction (including iron and steel process emissions); and CO2 emissions from public heat and electricity production. Road transport emissions continued to fall in 2010, despite more demand for freight transport. Higher industrial activity during 2010, after the economic contraction in 2009, appears to have led to higher final energy demand and related emissions in those sectors covered by the EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) compared to other sectors. Among the greenhouse gases reported to the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC), carbon dioxide (CO2) accounted for the largest increase in emissions in 2010. The gas represented 82 % of total EU GHG emissions. Industry emissions of hydroflourocarbons (HFCs), extremely potent GHGs, grew significantly in 2010, continuing the upward trend observed since 1990. Methane (8.6 % of total EU GHG emissions in CO2 equivalent) and nitrous oxide (7.2 %) declined. Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom accounted for 56% of the EU\u2019s total net increase in GHG emissions. The relative growth in emissions was highest in Estonia, Finland, Sweden and Latvia. Spain, Greece and Portugal again reported lower GHG emissions in 2010.

Data visualisation Early indications of 2011 figures The most recent data available for the EU GHG inventory is for 2010. Verified 2011 emissions from the EU ETS point to a 2 % emissions decrease over the course of the year. In 2011 the EU ETS covered more than 12,000 power plants and manufacturing installations in the EU-27, Norway and Liechtenstein. About the report The report is the annual submission of the greenhouse gas inventory of the European Union to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and under the Kyoto Protocol. It presents greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2010 for the EU-27, the EU-15, individual Member States and by economic sector. It covers emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases. The official EU submission to the UNFCCC is the result of a compilation made by the EEA. In autumn the EEA will publish early estimates for the 2011 emissions in the EU, and also a Trends and Projections report, looking ahead to assess progress against emissions targets.

But in several countries there is still a problem with pollution from agriculture and sewage, so we need to see more efforts to ensure safe and clean water for the public. Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The results are from the latest annual Bathing Water Report of European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Commission, which describes water quality in more than 22,000 bathing sites at beaches, rivers and lakes acrossEuropelast year. Environment Commissioner Janez Poto\u010dnik said: \u201cI am pleased to note that the quality of Europe's bathing waters generally remains high, and has improved since last year. A clear majority of Europeans are concerned about water quality issues, and want more information on this. We must therefore continue our work to ensure our waters are appropriate for all legitimate uses \u2013 from bathing to drinking - and that the overall aquatic ecosystem is in good health.\u201d Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cThe quality of water at beaches and other bathing spots is one of the most important environmental concerns of European citizens. But in several countries there is still a problem with pollution from agriculture and sewage, so we need to see more efforts to ensure safe and clean water for the public.\u201d The report found that 77.1\u00a0% of sites had excellent quality, i.e. complying with the most stringent guide values, an improvement of 3.5 percentage points on last year's data. Some 93.1\u00a0% of coastal bathing waters were classified as \u2018sufficient\u2019, or complying with the less stringent mandatory values \u2013 a 1\u00a0% increase. Less than 2\u00a0% of bathing waters were non-compliant. Cyprus, Croatia, Malta and Greece had excellent reports on their bathing water sites, all with more than 90\u00a0% of bathing water sites meeting the most stringent guide values (excellent quality), and the remainder complying with the mandatory values. At the opposite end of the scale, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Latvia, Luxemburg and Belgium had relatively low proportions of sites meeting the strict guide values, especially as regards inland waters. Water quality at Europe's most popular summer destinations was generally good \u2013 with more than 90 % of bathing water sites meeting the mandatory values. Spain,Italy and Portugal had more than 80 % of sites with excellent water quality. The overall quality of bathing waters in the EU has markedly improved since 1990. The number of coastal bathing waters not complying with the Bathing Water Directive\u2019s provisions fell from 9.2\u00a0% of sites in 1990 to 1.5\u00a0% in 2011. The number of inland bathing areas not complying with mandatory values decreased from 11.9\u00a0% in 1990 to 2.4\u00a0% in 2011, which is among the lowest percentages to date. Background Bathing water in Europe needs to comply with standards set in the 2006 Bathing Water Directive, which must be implemented by December 2014. The EU publishes an annual summary report on the quality of bathing water, based on reports that the Member States should submit before the end of the previous year. In this year's report, all 27 Member States as well as Croatia, Montenegro and Switzerland monitored and reported bathing water quality, most of them according to the new provisions. Two thirds of bathing sites were in coastal waters and the rest in rivers and lakes. The largest number of coastal bathing waters can be found inItaly ,Greece, France and Spain, while Germany and France have the highest number of inland bathing waters. Laboratories analysed levels of certain types of bacteria, including intestinal enterococci and Escherichia coli bacteria, which may indicate the presence of pollution, mainly from sewage or livestock waste. Sites are classified as compliant with mandatory values, compliant with the more stringent guidelines, or non-compliant. European citizens can find out about the water quality at their favourite swimming spot by checking the Water Information System for Europe (WISE). The site allows users to download data and check interactive maps. People can also report the state of their local water using the Eye on Earth website.

Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director Green economy is set to be one of the two main themes at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June this year. Simply put, a 'green economy' is one in which environmental, economic and social policies and innovations enable society to use resources efficiently, while maintaining the natural systems that sustain us. \"The focus on green economy in Rio reflects the issue's importance as a key environmental priority, and\u00a0is particularly timely, given that it can provide a path to renewed economic growth and job creation in response to the current severe economic crises facing Europe,\" EEA Executive\u00a0Director Jacqueline McGlade said. The 'Environmental indicator report 2012' presents established indicators that illustrate progress towards improving resource efficiency, and indicators that depict the risk of passing environmental thresholds. Jointly, they enable policymakers and the public to reflect on where Europe stands vis-\u00e0-vis some aspects of a green economy. Several of the indicators presented in this report show encouraging trends, while others point to issues that require urgent attention. European environmental policies have helped Europe use resources more efficiently. However, policies aimed at making ecosystems more resilient have been less successful. Both are central to Europe achieving a green economy and becoming sustainable, according to the report. The report emphasises that improving resource efficiency remains necessary, but stresses that this in itself may not be sufficient to ensure a resilient, sustainable natural environment. In some cases, reduced ecosystem resilience may even be irreversible, for example biodiversity loss leading to species extinction, or when environmental or climate tipping points are passed. Following\u00a0these findings, the report also considers the merits of designing policy objectives and targets that more explicitly address the links between resource efficiency, ecosystem resilience and human well-being\u00a0to support the\u00a0transition to a green economy. Key findings The report uses well-established environmental indicators, assessing progress towards a green economy along six environmental themes. Nitrogen emissions and threats to biodiversity: progress has been made to reduce pollution causing acidification and eutrophication. However, nitrogen emissions from sewage and agriculture remain high, and these pollutants continue to damage ecosystems and habitats. Carbon emissions and climate change: domestic greenhouse gas emissions have decreased substantially across the European Union but continue to rise on the global level. Rising temperatures threaten ecosystem resilience. Air pollution and air quality: air pollutant emissions have decreased in many parts of Europe; nonetheless, poor air quality is still a serious health issue, particularly in many cities. The marine environment: overfishing, shipping and other maritime activities put pressure on the marine environment; leading to altered, often less resilient marine ecosystems. Stress on water resources: managing water use and demand has helped reduce water use in all sectors; but high levels of water stress still endanger ecosystems in European water bodies. This problem is exacerbated by climate change and inefficient water use in some areas. Use of material resources: there has been progress in 'decoupling' economic growth and material resource use. However, overall consumption and production patterns are not sustainable. \u00a0 Green economy across Europe\u00a0 The report was presented to members of parliament (MPs)\u00a0from more than 20 EU Member States during a visit to the EEA on Monday 14 May 2012. Slovak MP Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Huba, Chairman of the Agriculture and Environment Committee said: \"Green economy is mentioned in the government's programme in Slovakia. This is a positive first step, but we are yet to see what might develop in terms of action.\" He added: \"I believe it is very important to carefully consider the outcomes of economic decisions, so growth and job creation (even if called 'green')\u00a0do not result environmental destruction.\" Jos\u00e9 Llorens Torres MP, who is President of the Spanish government's Commission on Agriculture, Food and Environment, explained the need for a green economy in his country: \"Spain has to both comply with EU objectives to reduce carbon emissions, and we have to reduce the deficit in line with the demands of the EU.\" UK MP Joan Walley, Chair of the UK government's Environmental Audit Committee said: \"Everyone understands what is meant by business as usual but few have signed up for the step change now urgently needed if we are to withstand the pressures on the earth's natural resources. The EEA's measured and robust research is the necessary point of departure if we are to safeguard our future. Their work needs to be understood, applied and used by all government departments including the Treasury.\"", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/do-we-live-in-a"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0439", "date": "2012-05-14", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Europe's future depends on cities resilient to climate change", "text": "Cities need to start investing in adaptation measures using ideas and best practice from around the world. The longer political leaders wait, the more expensive adaptation will become and the danger to citizens and the economy will increase. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director In Europe, temperature is increasing, precipitation is changing and sea level is rising. However, the effects will not be uniform across the continent, according to the EEA report, 'Urban adaptation to climate change in Europe'. The report is the first Europe-wide assessment of urban vulnerability to climate change. It argues that the distinct design and composition of urban areas compared to rural areas alters climate change impacts in cities, leading to many diverse challenges for cities within Europe. For example, a lot of artificial surfaces and little vegetation exacerbates heatwaves in cities . This so-called 'urban heat island' effect leads to much higher temperatures in cities than in the surrounding area. \"Most Europeans live in cities, which can be extremely vulnerable to extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change,\" EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said.\u00a0 \"Many cities are now facing impacts such as water scarcity, flooding and heatwaves, which are expected to become more frequent and intense than they are used to. Cities need to start investing in adaptation measures using ideas and best practice from around the world. The longer political leaders wait, the more expensive adaptation will become and the danger to citizens and the economy will increase.\" One example was the extreme rainfall that took place in Copenhagen in 2011. The city centre was flooded when over 150 mm of rain fell in during a two hour period on 2 July 2011. Insurance damages alone were estimated at EUR 650\u2013700 million.\u00a0 The frequency of such events is expected to increase in future due to climate change. According to the report, roughly one fifth of European cities with over 100 000 inhabitants are very vulnerable to river floods. More than half of Europe\u2019s cities have a low share of vegetated areas, which can strongly exacerbate heatwaves. This is particularly relevant in cities where there is a high proportion of vulnerable people, such as the large proportion of elderly citizens in Italian, German and Northern Spanish cities. Cities are heavily interconnected with other cities and regions in Europe. The report stresses that urban adaptation is therefore not only a local task but requires concerted action at all policy levels. The report draws attention to the important role of European and national policy in helping cities adapt to climate change by providing a supportive framework. Such a framework includes a coherent and 'climate-proof' policy, a stronger territorial approach targeted at the specific challenges in different regions, a capable set of institutions and access to funding. Last but not least it calls for more knowledge to support a multi-level approach to urban adaptation. Examples of adaptation The report provides generic advice for adapting cities to climate change and examples of best practice: Climate change adaptation should be flexible to accommodate uncertainty. This is evident in the Thames barrier, which protects London from sea level rise \u2013 the barrier height can be adjusted to cope with different levels of warming and climate change. Adaptation should work with nature, not against it. The Dutch government assessed that climate change demanded a change in its water management. This includes actions to give more space to rivers in the Netherlands, achieved by lowering and widening the flood plains and constructing water retention and storage areas and at the same time creating additional nature areas. In the city of Oostend, Belgium, a new beach has been constructed which will help protect the city from storm surges and coastal flooding. Many adaptation measures can make cities more pleasant places to live. Malm\u00f6 in Sweden manages rainwater flows with a new open storm-water-system. Here, green roofs and open water channels lead rainwater into collection points that form a temporary reservoir. The city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland, has restored its river area with more green spaces to reduce flood risk \u2013 also improving quality of life for city-dwellers. People also need to change behaviour in order to adapt. Following water shortages in the 1990s, the City of Zaragoza in Spain managed to create a 'water saving culture'. Within 15 years this successful campaign aimed at citizens and businesses helped the city cut water consumption by almost 30 %, despite a 12 % population increase. Many areas have to anticipate impacts which may be more intense or frequent than before. Botkyrka in Sweden was the only Swedish municipality that was prepared for heatwaves when high temperatures hit in 2010. Social services had identified vulnerable people, and the authorities were prepared to help them. Many measures do not have to be huge in scale or cost to be effective when mainstreamed into other planning. A new metro line is being built in Copenhagen, Denmark, with elevated entrances to avoid storm water flooding the tracks. The recently launched European Climate Adaptation Platform Climate-ADAPT provides a comprehensive web resource aimed at policy makers and 'practitioners' \u2013 engineers, planners and administrators \u2013 who can obtain adaptation knowledge in Europe and learn from the experience of others facing similar challenges already carrying out adaptation actions elsewhere. For policy makers, the report includes: an overview of generic planning steps, adaptation options and success factors for urban adaptation , and a pathway to effective multi-level governance of urban adaptation.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/europe2019s-future-depends-on-cities"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0440", "date": "2012-05-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Increase in cancers and fertility problems may be caused by household chemicals and pharmaceuticals", "text": "Scientific research gathered over the last few decades shows us that endocrine disruption is a real problem, with serious effects on wildlife, and possibly people. It would be prudent to take a precautionary approach to many of these chemicals until their effects are more fully understood. EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade Chemicals which can potentially disrupt the endocrine system can be found in food, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, household products and cosmetics. In recent decades, there has been a significant growth in many human diseases and disorders including breast and prostate cancer, male infertility and diabetes. Many scientists think that this growth is connected to the rising levels of exposure to mixtures of some chemicals in widespread use. \"Scientific research gathered over the last few decades shows us that endocrine disruption is a real problem, with serious effects on wildlife, and possibly people\", EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said. \"It would be prudent to take a precautionary approach to many of these chemicals until their effects are more fully understood.\" The Weybridge +15 (1996-2011) report on endocrine disruptors was launched at Brunel University outside London today. It is the result of an international workshop that evaluated the findings of the last 15 years of research. The report follows the 1996 Weybridge report and associated workshop, where the problem of EDCs was first comprehensively discussed by regulatory authorities and scientists together.\u00a0 Reasons for scientific uncertainty The report shows clearly that there is strong evidence of harm from EDCs in some wildlife species and in laboratory studies using rodent models for human health. However, the effects of EDCs on humans may be more difficult to demonstrate, due to the length, cost and methodological difficulties with these types of studies \u2013 so wildlife and animal studies may be seen in some cases as an early warning of the dangers. \u00a0 In the last 10 years, risk assessment and regulatory frameworks for dealing with EDCs have been created and screening procedures have been developed to test chemicals for endocrine disrupting properties. There are still lots of factors that make the risk assessment process difficult. Chief amongst these is the fact that these chemicals can affect early development of, for example, the brain, reproductive, immune and metabolic systems in detrimental ways that are often invisible until several years or sometimes decades after exposure. \u00a0 Scientific understanding is further complicated because mixtures of similarly acting EDCs in combination may contribute to an overall effect, whilst each of these chemicals alone may not cause harm. These factors make it hard for scientists to identify thresholds of exposure below which there are no effects. However, there is a large body of evidence linking chemical exposure to thyroid, immune, reproductive and neurological problems in animals, and many of the same or similar diseases and disorders have been observed to be rising in human populations. Both animals and humans may be exposed to these chemicals in the environment, or via water or the food chain where the chemicals can build up. Possible effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals The link between some diseases and EDCs is now accepted. For example, exposure to oestrogen or to oestrogenic EDCs is an accepted risk factor for breast cancer, endometriosis, fibroids and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in women. Breast cancer rates are increasing in almost all industrialised countries. The majority of these cases are due to lifestyles and environmental exposures, rather than specific genetic factors. Some EDCs may also cause low quality semen. \u00a0Detailed reviews of current knowledge show clearly that human male reproductive problems are increasing in many countries. There are large regional differences in semen quality. In some European regions approximately 40% of men suffer from reduced fertility while in others it is less than 10% Laboratory studies show that the reproductive systems of a broad range of vertebrate species, for example polar bears and fish, and some invertebrate species such as some snails and oysters are susceptible to EDCs. Some studies have linked EDCs to thyroid disease. Thyroid cancer rates have increased by between 5\u00a0% (Switzerland) and 155\u00a0% (France), particularly in women, children and young adults. Several studies have also linked exposure to some EDCs with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, attention deficit disorder and diminished cognitive function in children. However, more work is needed in this area to confirm or refute theories involving the wider sphere of EDCs in modern commerce There is a trend towards the earlier onset of puberty in girls, which may be influenced by EDCs. Some persistent endocrine disrupting substances, such as DDT, TBT and PCBs - now banned or restricted in their use - have been shown to cause catastrophic declines in mollusc, seal and bird populations in some parts of the world as a result of their effects on reproduction. Scientists are concerned that many chemicals that are still in modern commerce also affect the human reproductive system.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/increase-in-cancers-and-fertility"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0441", "date": "2012-05-10", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Water: how can we account for our most vital resource?", "text": "Many parts of the world could face a water crisis in the future, not because they do not have enough water, but because they are not using it smartly enough. Accurate water accounts quantifying the amount of water we can safely use can help us use this resource both wisely and fairly. Jacqueline McGlade, lead author and EEA Executive Director The report 'Measuring Water Use in a Green Economy' argues that while the world faces serious water problems, their causes are often economic, social and political in nature, rather than bio-physical. These problems can be solved by balancing water use and needs between different sectors and ecosystems. The report serves as a powerful reminder just weeks ahead of the Rio +20 global summit on sustainable development that the world needs to radically rethink the way it uses natural resources. The lead author of the report, Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency (EEA), said: \"Many parts of the world could face a water crisis in the future, not because they do not have enough water, but because they are not using it smartly enough. Accurate water accounts quantifying the amount of water we can safely use can help us use this resource both wisely and fairly.\" The growing demands placed on water supply are not only the result of population growth, but also a result of\u00a0the way in which our economies develop, according to the Resource Panel. Since 1900, humanity's water consumption has grown at twice the rate of population growth, jumping from 600 billion cubic metres in 1900 to 4,500 billion cubic metres in 2010. People are not the only water users \u2013 environmental systems also need water to function. Maintaining these 'ecosystem services' should be seen as vitally important, as they form the basis of the European economy, the report argues. Water accounting is a crucial tool for the purpose of water management and making economic assessments, alongside GDP growth and other economy-wide indicators such as greenhouse gas emissions. Ecosystem services should be considered within such resource accounting schemes to establish the links between resource efficiency, biodiversity and ecosystem services. The private sector is showing increasing interest in taking water resources into account when considering future business. For public bodies to determine water balances, the report states that it is important to produce quantitative estimates of stocks and flows. Water accounts should also include other information, such as analysis of the impact of fluctuations and uncertainties associated with the global hydrological cycle, water licences, access rights and water quality.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/water-how-can-we-account"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0442", "date": "2012-05-08", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Generation \u201992 video competition: And the winners are...", "text": "Judges were impressed with the huge diversity and originality of the entries from 16 different European countries.

The telecommunications and internet revolutions, the financial crisis, and the rise of the developing world have radically altered the foundations of policymaking that existed in 1992. Is the idea of sustainable development still relevant in a world where western countries lack money to invest? Is it relevant in a world where billions of people seek to enjoy the comfort of middle class lifestyles, which so often involve unsustainable consumption? The answer is yes. Sustainable development is more relevant now than ever. The world has certainly become more complex since 1992. 20 years ago, policy-makers were only starting to link environmental problems with development issues. But we now have ample evidence of just how interlinked these issues are. Further complexity has been added by the financial crisis, and by the growing awareness of our dependency on a dwindling stock of natural resources.\u00a0But this complexity has also brought clarity. We now know we must address all these issues together. The idea of a \u2018Green Economy\u2019 is one of the concepts to have emerged in recent years as a way of thinking about sustainable development. \u00a0Although there are several definitions of what a green economy is, it has three key aims: to maximise resource efficiency, by reducing our use of water, fossil fuels, and mined materials as much as possible. to ensure the \u2018resilience\u2019 of our ecosystems and the services they provide. For example, forests help absorb carbon and the seas provide us with fish, but we must use these resources prudently so they can replenish themselves.\u00a0 to provide jobs and opportunities for the world\u2019s growing population and meet their expectations of improved standards of living. By 2050 the world\u2019s population will be 9 billion people, up from 7 billion today. There will be 3 billion extra middle class consumers by 2030 and their raised living standards will put strain on the planet\u2019s resources. The green economy provides a framework for our future development in a world that is facing ever-greater demand for food, land, water, materials and energy. The technical challenges in creating a green economy are great, but they are surmountable. In fact, the greatest immediate challenge is financial. Most economies in the developed world are still reeling from the financial crisis, and almost all are embarking on austerity programmes. This climate of retrenchment is affecting appetite for investment in much-needed clean-technology. Investment in clean-tech, already insufficient before the financial crisis, is now falling even further. If we are to create a green economy, we must overcome these barriers. Governments must create the right incentives to encourage the investment needed, while at the same time re-assessing what public-private partnerships might help to further the goal of sustainable development. Rio 2012 is an opportunity for the world\u2019s policy-makers to adopt a green economy roadmap for sustainable development for the next 20 years and beyond. It should contain specific goals and timetables as well as the policy actions these goals will require. If we achieve this, we will be able to look back on the Rio conference as the point that the global economy was set on a green, inclusive and sustainable footing.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/rio-2012-is-an-opportunity"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0444", "date": "2012-04-25", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Creating a quiet environment", "text": "Across Europe, at least 100 million people are exposed to damaging levels of noise from road traffic alone.

In a keynote address, President Laura Chinchilla described Costa Rica\u2019s development of democratic institutions, education, environmental conservation and justice as major milestones in their success. \u201cI represent a country that, despite its modest resources, has managed to continually improve the quality of life of its people,\u201d she said.

These include the Biodiversity Information System for Europe, the Water Information System for Europe and the land use data centre.\u00a0 Adaptation should happen in many different sectors. For example, this was stressed in a report published by the EEA in March, which stated that climate change is making water supply less predictable, so it is extremely important that agriculture, industry and the public all use water more efficiently for their mutual benefit. More than 25 countries voluntarily submitted information on their national strategies and plans, assessments, climate services, and priority actions. The site features a continuously-updated database of adaptation strategies and actions at the transnational and country level. There are also case studies on initial adaptation actions at local and sub-national level. \u00a0In addition, the website includes potential future adaptation options, methodologies and maps, on impacts, vulnerabilities and risks from a range of EU research projects. It aims to support the European Commission\u2019s comprehensive EU climate change adaptation strategy, due in 2013. More information from the European Commission is available here. Examples of adaptation across sectors in Europe The Arctic faces much larger temperature increases than the global average increase and a decrease in summer sea ice cover with risks for wildlife. There is a potential for increasing oil and gas exploration and shipping in the region, but the environmental impacts should be addressed. Arctic countries are considering adapting their fishing industry to northward moving fish species. In Northern Europe adaptation actions may address less snow and lake and river ice cover and increased winter and spring river flows. Adaptation plans focus on flood risk management, increased hydropower potential, enhanced forest growth, lower energy consumption for heating and possibly growing summer tourism. In North-western Europe risks of coastal flooding in densely populated low-lying coastal areas are increasing. These may be addressed by coastal defence systems and measures such as sand replenishment. Other adaptation actions include giving more space to rivers to address flood risks, revising building standards, changing management of nature protection areas and putting health action plans in place to cope with heat waves. Central and eastern Europe is addressing adaptation to temperature extremes together with reduced summer precipitation, increased risk of droughts, increasing energy demand in summer and increased intensity and frequency of river floods in winter and spring. Alpine countries are facing loss of glacier mass, reduced snow cover, thawing of permafrost and less precipitation falling as snow, leading to potential increases in the frequency and intensity of floods and rock falls. Priority sectors for adaptation actions include tourism (reduced skiing in winter), hydropower (lower water availability) and nature protection (addressing upward shifts in vegetation zones and related biodiversity loss). Southern European countries are addressing increasing risks of droughts and decreases in water availability combined with an increasing demand from agriculture, tourism and households. These countries also address in their plans lower agricultural crop yields, biodiversity loss, forest fires and heat waves affecting human health, lower water availability for hydropower and high summer temperatures affecting tourism.

Air pollution affects people\u2019s quality of life.\" Ozone can cause respiratory problems and other severe health problems. Ground level ozone production depends on weather conditions such as solar intensity and temperature, and is a result of chemical reactions between other pollutants in the air. These include nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, methane and non-methane volatile organic compounds. These substances are emitted by industry, transport, agriculture and other sources. The European Environment Agency (EEA) publishes an annual report on summer ozone levels. The 2012 report, covering April to September 2011, was based on data from 2 186 monitoring sites across Europe. Main findings of the report In the summer of 2011, the \u2018information threshold\u2019 and the \u2018long term objective\u2019 (LTO) for the protection of human health were both exceeded in the lowest proportion of air monitoring stations since the start of comprehensive Europe-wide data reporting in 1997. This reduction was mainly due to unusually low temperatures and increased rainfall during the summer months, although there have also been some reductions in the emissions of ozone-precursor pollutants. The information threshold (a one-hour ozone concentration of 180 \u03bcg/m3) was exceeded at monitoring sites in 16 EU Member States and four non-member countries. The information threshold was exceeded at approximately 18\u00a0% of all operational stations. Only northern Italy and several more isolated locations reported a substantial number of exceedances. As in previous years, the LTO for the protection of human health (maximum daily eight-hour mean concentration of 120 \u03bcg/m3) was exceeded in all EU Member States. These exceedances were registered at approximately 84 % of all operational stations. This limit was exceeded on more than 25 days in a significant part of Europe. The alert threshold (a one-hour average ozone concentration of 240 \u03bcg/m3) was exceeded 41 times. Concentrations of 300 \u00b5g/m3 or more were measured three times in 2011, in Bulgaria, Italy and Spain. Ozone pollution \u2013 not only a local air quality issue In Europe, ozone concentrations in a particular country are also influenced by emissions in other northern hemisphere countries and by sectors such as international shipping and aviation. Thus, ozone pollution is not only a local air quality issue but also a hemispheric and global problem. Data sources on emissions of ozone precursor gases The EEA ground-level ozone viewer provides interactive access to provisional unvalidated ozone data in near real-time. Moreover, the Agency recently published preliminary emissions data on the air pollutants that contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone.

The meeting is particularly timely, as green economy is one of the priority discussion points of the landmark sustainable development summit in Rio de Janeiro in June this year. Some facts about consumption Europe consumes more resources than most other regions. An average European citizen uses approximately four times more resources than one in Africa and three times more than one in Asia, but half of that of a citizen of the USA, Canada or Australia Resource use in Europe is increasing. Resource use per person increased by 9.1% in the EU-27 between 2000 and 2007, reaching some 17 tonnes per person annually. Of the 8.2 billion tonnes of materials used in the EU in 2007, minerals and metals accounted for more than half, while fossil fuels and biomass were approximately a quarter each. Europe can use resources more efficiently. 87% of EU citizens agree that Europe could use its natural resources more efficiently, and 41% think that their household produces too much waste. Europeans use more and more space for living. The average floor area of dwellings increased from 81 to 87 m\u00b2 since 1990, while the number of people per household decreased from 2.8 to 2.4. Europeans travel more kilometres by car. Although cars on average become more fuel-efficient, overall fuel consumption for private cars barely goes down, mainly because more kilometres are driven. An estimated 89 million tonnes of food ends up as waste each year in the EU. This is roughly 180 kg per citizen, wasted in households, manufacturing, shops and restaurants. In the UK, 25% of food purchased is thrown out, of which nearly two-thirds could have been eaten. Consumption indirectly uses water. For example, a cheeseburger requires 2,400 litres of water to produce, including the bread, beef and cheese. There are also indirect greenhouse gas emissions from our consumption. Staying with the burger example, producing the average patty results in more carbon emissions than driving 15 km in a large car.\u00a0 Current consumption leads to unsustainable waste levels. In 2008, every citizen on average threw out 444 kg of household waste, and indirectly generated 5.2 tonnes of waste in the European economy. And this is just in the EU - no data are available on waste generated from producing products and materials which are imported from other regions.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/unsustainable-consumption-2013-the-mother"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0450", "date": "2012-02-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Europe needs to use water more efficiently", "text": "Agriculture, energy production, industry, public water supply and ecosystems are all important, and all competing for this limited resource. With climate change making water supply less predictable, it is extremely important that Europe uses water more efficiently for the benefit of all its users. EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade The report 'Towards Efficient use of water resources in Europe' from the European Environment Agency (EEA) makes the case for an integrated water management, starting with better implementation of existing legislation. \"Water resources are under pressure in many parts of Europe, and it is getting worse,\" EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade said. \"Agriculture, energy production, industry, public water supply and ecosystems are all important, and all competing for this limited resource. With climate change making water supply less predictable, it is extremely important that Europe uses water more efficiently for the benefit of all its users. Water resources should be managed as effectively as any other natural asset owned by countries.\" Water shortages have severe consequences for economies reliant on agriculture and industry. Some shortages have even led to drinking water restrictions in parts of Europe. There are also indirect effects on the economy, as reduced river flows, falling lake and groundwater levels, and disappearing wetlands can have destructive effects on the natural systems underpinning economic productivity. Increasingly, there is intense competition for water resources in some parts of Europe. Across the European Union, agriculture uses about a quarter of water diverted from the natural environment, though this can be up to 80% in southern Europe. In addition, public water supply accounts for approximately a fifth of water use across Europe \u2013 and over a quarter of this is used just to flush the toilet. Hydropower installations also change the natural structure and flow of rivers and lakes, with consequences for\u00a0ecosystems. Agriculture is one sector where easy efficiency gains are possible, because a lot of water is used inefficiently to irrigate crops. Some estimates calculate that approximately a quarter of water abstracted for irrigation in Europe could be saved, just by changing the type of pipe or channel used. Public water supply can be made more effective - as much as 50% of drinking water is lost in some EU Member States. Inefficient use of water also leads to higher energy use, with extra financial and environmental costs, according to the report. While the energy needed to pump and treat freshwater into drinking water is typically around 0.6 kWh/m3, desalination of seawater adds approximately 4 kWh/m3. Several European countries use desalination technology, most notably Spain, which is among the highest users of desalination globally. Authorities should set clear environmental targets for water use, within the limit of what is sustainable, according to the report. Such targets would differ depending on the available resources, but should be designed so that the natural environment has sufficient water to function. A form of 'decoupling' is needed so that increasing economic productivity does not entail increasing water use and increasing environmental impacts. Historically, water prices in Europe have rarely reflected the true financial cost of supplying water, nor the economic costs to the environment. This has led to pollution and water scarcity, imposing costs on the environment and society. For example, the general public typically has to pay for the cost of treating drinking water contaminated by agriculture or industry. Putting the right price on water can incentivise more efficient use of water and technological innovation. Effective use of taxes, subsidies, market mechanisms, pricing schemes and other economic instruments can also help balance conflicting demands on water. Later this year, the 'Blueprint to safeguard Europe's waters' published by the European Commission will map the way forward in this area. Throughout 2012 the EEA will release a series of reports on related water issues, exploring a variety of challenges and opportunities.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/europe-needs-to-use-water"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0451", "date": "2012-02-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Air pollutant emission limits exceeded in twelve EU Member States", "text": "These pollutants contribute to health problems and can also lead to economic losses and environmental damage. The EEA data shows that many EU Member States missed the 2010 limits, so\u00a0these countries will need to make further efforts to help reduce air pollution in Europe. EEA Executive Director Professor Jacqueline McGlade For the first time, preliminary data recently reported to the EEA by Member States allow a comparison with the legally binding emission limits for 2010 set in the EU NEC Directive. The directive covers four main air pollutants: sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and ammonia (NH3). These pollutants can cause respiratory problems, contribute to the acidification of soil and surface water, and damage vegetation. The ceilings set in the NEC directive were designed to reduce such adverse impacts by an agreed amount. \"These pollutants contribute to health problems and can also lead to economic losses and environmental damage,\" EEA Executive Director Prof. Jacqueline McGlade said. \"The EEA data shows that many EU Member States missed the 2010 limits, so\u00a0these countries will need to make further efforts to help reduce air pollution in Europe.\" The pollutant for which most exceedances were registered was NOx. Preliminary analysis shows eleven Member States exceeding their respective NOx ceilings (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Spain and Sweden) (see Table 1). The road transport sector is one of the main contributory factors behind the large number of NOx exceedances, contributing approximately 40 % of total EU-27 NOx emissions. Reductions of NOx from this sector over the last 2 decades have not been as large as originally anticipated. This is partly because the sector has grown more than expected and partly because vehicle emission standards have not always delivered the anticipated level of NOx reductions. Spain was the only Member State to have exceeded three of its four emission ceilings under the NECD; followed by Germany with two exceedances. Finland exceeded its ammonia ceiling. Table 1.

It is also a major global carbon sink, with significant potential to remove climate-changing gases from the atmosphere. The European Environment Agency (EEA) has joined forces with the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre on 'The state of soil in Europe', a comprehensive scientific report highlighting the need to protect and maintain soil in a co-ordinated way across the European Union. The report warns that failure to tackle increased soil degradation could eventually compromise food production. Moreover, degraded soil is less able to prevent droughts and flooding and stop biodiversity loss. The EEA reported in its last flagship report that Europe's soils are subject to erosion and landslides. Organic matter and biodiversity are both declining in some areas, while compaction, salinisation, and contamination are also significant issues. All these problems have considerable economic and environmental consequences. For example, soil erosion by water affects around 16% of Europe's land area. It is largely the result of\u00a0poor land management, such as deforestation, overgrazing, construction activities and forest fires. For further information on the threats to Europe's soils, see the 2010 EEA assessment, which includes a summary of key facts and key messages. These sources focus on how unsustainable human use and management of land is leading to increased soil degradation, and the loss of a resource that is fundamental to life on the planet.

In the agreement, signatories note that \u201cEurope leaves a footprint in the Greenlandic and Arctic environment with known, as well as suspected, effects on human health\u201d. Pollutants can be transported across the Atlantic by ocean currents and atmospheric deposition, and may accumulate in certain foods in Greenland. Another important environmental issue in Greenland is waste management, because waste is often not separated or stored properly so there is a risk it will leach into the surrounding environment. This problem is exacerbated by the long distances between settlements and waste treatment plants. The EEA is working with the Greenlandic government to improve the situation. In the agreement between the EEA and the Health Ministry, initial priorities for collaboration include establishing a liaison agreement on exchange of personnel. In addition, both parties hope to exchange data, knowledge and information on environment-related health issues. There is particular interest in the effects of chemicals and hazardous substances, the human consequences of waste management, and health impacts of climate change. Several areas of EEA work are of immediate relevance for the Arctic, such as health impacts of climate change, reducing burdens and health impacts of hazardous chemicals in children, and reducing health inequalities.

There are at least four\u00a0possible\u00a0types of\u00a0effects of ETR. The first effect is to make various goods or activities more expensive, while the second effect comes from the direct or indirect distribution of this extra\u00a0revenue. Thirdly, job creation and eco-innovation may be another result of this process. And lastly, effective ETR will also result in environmental benefits, for example by reducing pollution. Environmental taxation also has an important role to play in spurring innovation, according to a broad range of studies. By increasing tax on pollution and other environmentally-damaging activities, governments can use the extra funds to provide incentives for innovation, such as developing renewable energy. For advanced economies like the EU, such schemes also create new technologies which can be exported globally, the reports say. The reports also look at ETR in practice across Europe. Analysis of policies in Germany and the Netherlands showed that ETR and other environmental policy instruments have broadly positive effects in increasing innovation. The wider economic effects of ETR have also been analysed in Germany, where environmental taxation cut pension contributions and created an estimated 250 000 jobs. One of the challenges of ETR is ensuring the costs and benefits are appropriately distributed across society, and do not negatively impact the poorest people. Instruments also need to balance the right mix of environmental and economic incentives. Ultimately, ETR mechanisms\u00a0can only be\u00a0implemented if they are acceptable to the public and policy-makers. Modelling the impact of environmental tax reform The EEA calculated the impact of a tax on energy and other resources, with the revenues used to cut social security payments and income taxes. The model indicated that this fiscal reform would result in financial benefits for almost all socio-economic groups. However, in a few countries the poorest people could see negative effects, as these people spend a higher proportion of their income on energy. Increasing the cost of emitting carbon could also have a negative effect on the poorest groups, according to a Germany-based modelling study. However, the scenario shows that the worst-hit parts of society could lose just 1 % of their disposable income in 2020, so it would be relatively simple and affordable to compensate\u00a0the affected groups\u00a0via targeted benefit transfers. Furthermore, the reduction in social security payments means labour costs decrease, boosting employment \u2013 the model suggests that increasing the price of emitting one tonne of carbon dioxide to \u20ac68 by 2020 could create 152 000 additional jobs in Germany.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The modelling exercise also analysed the effects of applying ETR to meet the EU target of reducing greenhouse gases by 20 % by 2020. This scenario looked at the effect of taxing emissions, with the revenues used to support innovation and reduce income tax and social security costs. The model showed that the policies would increase employment by more than 1 million jobs, with only a small (0.04 %) cost to GDP to achieve the 20% GHG reduction target at EU level.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/environmental-tax-reform-increasing-individual"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0457", "date": "2011-12-21", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Economic growth must be decoupled from environmental harm \u2013 the EEA evaluates findings from 2011", "text": "Many different environmental analyses carried out in 2011 once again demonstrated that environmental harm falls when economic growth slows down.

In June 2012, government representatives from around the world will meet in Rio de Janeiro, 20 years after the first historic Earth Summit \u2013 and the EEA will support the negotiations with the latest environmental information. To support better information sharing, the EEA has launched a new version of the Eye on Earth global public information service. Information sharing is becoming an increasingly important part of modern life. Eye on Earth allows anyone to make maps and other visualisations using data from many different global, national and local organisations. Once new data or information is entered into the system in one place, it has a potentially global reach, combining with new information across different networks to build an ever-more detailed and accurate picture of our world. Pollution rebounds with the economy In 2009, transport demand fell, leading to lower emissions from cars, trucks and planes. \u00a0Greenhouse gas emissions fell by 7.1 % in 2009, while air pollution was also reduced. For example, sulphur dioxide (SOx) emissions fell by 21 %. Air pollution and carbon dioxide from industrial plants in the EU caused \u20ac102-169 billion health costs in 2009, according to analysis carried out by the EEA. This cost would likely be much higher in a non-recession year. Recession also hit other \u2018eco sectors\u2019 of the economy \u2013 for example, revenues from recycling almost doubled between 2004 and 2008 to become a \u20ac60 billion industry in the EU. But growth took a hit during the recession as demand for recycled materials fell. Pollution and emissions increased in many cases in 2010, as economic growth returned. According to an early estimate from the EEA, greenhouse gas emissions increased 2.4 % in 2010, although analysis shows that renewable energy and other policies have helped to curb this emissions increase. Air pollution was also a major problem in 2010. There were many cases where ground-level ozone (O3) levels exceeded predefined limit values, while another report showed 95% of Europeans living in urban areas were exposed to O3 levels above World Health Organisation guidelines. An early estimate of nitrous oxide (NOx) pollution showed that the target ceiling was exceeded by 17 % in the EU. Other findings from the EEA in 2011 Renewable energy is set to grow fast, according to countries\u2019 plans for meeting the 20% renewable energy targets for 2020.

Fines for failing to meet the target (also known as \u2018excess emissions premiums\u2019) will be calculated on a progressive scale for each additional gram of CO2 above the target, multiplied by the number of cars sold. \u201cToday people use many forms of transport, but cars still represent a big part of everyday life,\u201d EEA Executive Director Prof. Jacqueline McGlade said. \u201cThe data show that most car manufacturers have already met their individual 2012 targets. However, several others need to continue their current trend of year-on-year efficiency improvements.\u201d Key findings: Thirty-two manufacturers, representing almost 80 % of 2010 registrations in the EU, already achieve their 2012 specific emissions targets two years in advance. If car manufacturers make no further improvements in carbon efficiency of new cars between 2010 and 2015, non-compliant manufacturers could face fines\u00a0which in total would add up to \u20ac10 billion. Toyota Motor Europe is already compliant with its 2012 target, and also less than 1g CO2/km from the more stringent 2015 target. Automobiles Peugeot and Automobiles Citro\u00ebn are also both close to reaching their 2015 target already. These manufacturers need to cut their emissions by less than 5g CO2/km to meet the target, a value corresponding to the average reduction of emissions from new passenger cars between 2009 and 2010 in Europe. Among the larger manufacturers, Daimler AG, Skoda, Nissan International SA, General Motors Daewoo, Mazda Motor Corporation and Dacia will have to reduce the average emissions of their fleets by more than 14 g CO2/km over the next five years. There are three manufacturers which produce only electric vehicles \u2013 so their emissions are listed as zero. Of the manufacturers producing some conventional-fuelled cars, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd had the lowest CO2 emission level overall (104 g CO2/Km). The average mass of its fleet is the lowest among all the car manufacturers registering vehicles in Europe. Among the larger manufacturers, Fiat Group Automobiles Spa had the lowest average CO2 emissions in 2010 (125 g CO2/km). At the other end of the spectrum, some carmakers will need to halve emissions in the next four years in order to comply with the legislation. \u00a0 The legislation provides for incentives to car manufacturers to reduce the CO2 emissions of their vehicles. For calculating average emissions, certain types of vehicles receive additional incentives, including super credits for low emitting vehicles (<50g CO2/km) and other credits for biofuels and certain efficiency measures. Manufacturers' progress will be monitored each year by the European Commission and the EEA in order to track the performance against individual targets.

The 'Durban Platform for Enhanced Action' is a process to develop a legal framework applicable to all Parties to the UN climate convention. It aims to raise levels of ambition in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Durban climate conference also agreed to launch a work plan to identify options for closing the \"ambition gap\" between countries' current emissions reduction pledges for 2020 and the goal of keeping global warming below 2\u00b0C. The package decided in Durban foresees a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, starting in 2013 and avoiding a gap after the first commitment period running from 2008-12. New arrangements were made to increase the transparency of emissions reduction actions, a key measure for building trust between Parties. Another area of agreement was in the design and governance arrangements for the new Green Climate Fund. The fund is expected to be one of the major distribution channels for the USD 100 billion in assistance which developed countries have pledged to mobilise for developing nations annually by 2020. These funds will support mitigation efforts. The EEA - supporting action on climate change The European Environment Agency (EEA) publishes several reports each year improving the understanding of climate change, climate change mitigation and adaptation. This information is freely available for policy-makers and the public. In October, the EEA published a report assessing progress towards the Kyoto target and the EU\u2019s greenhouse gas emission reduction target for 2020. The EEA also updates the annual European Union greenhouse gas inventory and prepares greenhouse gas country profiles. Greenhouse gas emissions across the EU can easily be analysed with the EEA greenhouse gas data viewer. Strategies to adapt to climate change are necessary to manage impacts even if the global average temperature remains within a 2\u00b0 C increase above the pre-industrial level. Therefore the EEA has published reports addressing the question of how to adapt to climate change. These include a range of assessments and a report on regional climate change and adaptation. The EEA plans to publish\u00a0the updated European Union greenhouse gas inventory by mid-2012 and a report on the impacts of climate change later that year. \u00a0Related links European Commission press release 'Durban conference delivers breakthrough for climate on COP17 results' European Parliament press release 'UN climate summit: Talks succeed, action must follow' UNFCCC 'Synthesis and assessment report on the greenhouse gas inventories submitted in 2011' (covering \u2018Annex I Parties\u2019) UNFCCC webpage on 'Decisions adopted by COP 17 and CMP 7'", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/cop17-climate-talks-mapping-the"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0460", "date": "2011-12-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Global initiative for sharing information takes off at Eye on Earth Summit", "text": "The Abu Dhabi Summit was an enormous success.

EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade The EEA has already uploaded hundreds of theme-specific map and data viewers into the service. Examples of other data contributors include UNEP and the US, providing datasets on diverse topics such as streets, mountains, water quality, watersheds and eco-regions. During the Summit, both UNEP and the US announced their continued support and use of the service in the future. At the end of the four-day summit, a declaration was signed which will lead to increased sharing of economic, environmental and social information. It was supported by numerous global, national and non-governmental organisations. The declaration will feed into the global United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012. Principle 10 of the 1992 Rio Declaration states the importance of public authorities facilitating and encouraging public access to environmental information. The Summit was dedicated to the critical issue of greater access to open and shared environmental and societal data for enhanced decision making. It brought together the global leadership of the environmental information movement, a group dedicated to bringing the benefits of better information to people and decision-makers around the planet. \u201cThe Abu Dhabi Summit was an enormous success,\u201d said EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade. \u201cThe launch of the Eye on Earth global public information service and network demonstrated how important sharing information will be in the future.

The analysis redistributes 'indirect' emissions, mostly from oil refineries and plants generating electricity and heat, in order to calculate the overall emissions linked to each sector. When the indirect emissions are considered, greenhouse gas emissions from the residential sector double (from 12 to 25 %) and the commercial sector trebles (from 5 to 15 %). Industry jumps from 15 to 26% when indirect emissions are factored in. Transport causes relatively small indirect emissions, pushing transport emissions from 25 to 29 %. Changes in emissions 2008-2009 Between 2008 and 2009, energy-related emissions fell by 7 % in the EU. This dramatic fall has been attributed largely to the effect of the economic recession, a fact which is backed up by the new end use analysis. Between 2008 and 2009, greenhouse gas emissions reductions in industry accounted for two thirds of all energy-related emission reductions, when indirect emissions are included. After industry, transport was the sector contributing most to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2009, in particular road transport. Part of this reduction in emissions on an end-use basis was accounted for by lower electric rail transport demand in 2009. Greenhouse gas emissions caused by households and other services fell between 2008 and 2009. This was despite the colder winter - there was an increase in the number of \u2018heating degree days\u2019 in most European countries (an indicator of household demand for heating) compared to 2008. Although there was an increase in indirect emissions from heat and electricity used in homes in the EU, emissions from home heating appliances fell by a larger amount \u2013 leading to an overall decrease in end-use emissions from homes. Objective of the report The objective of this report is to help improve the understanding of past greenhouse gas (GHG) emission trends in the energy sector from the demand or end-user side. To do this, the report develops a methodology to redistribute emissions from energy industries to the final users (by sector) of that energy. \u00a0This reallocation is done on the basis of Eurostat\u2019s energy balances and GHG inventories for the energy sector as reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), for the period 2005\u20132009.

The partners are showcasing the new service during the Eye on Earth Summit in Abu Dhabi from 12-15 December. Organisations across the globe are now invited to join the network and start adding data to the range of datasets already available. The web service takes the form of online maps, which can be manipulated by users. Without the need for any technical training, people can choose to add a huge variety of layers to the map \u2013 for example showing pollution, social development, economic factors, land use, transport and so on \u2013 to create new insights. The creators of Eye on Earth hope to add other data visualisation functions in the future, alongside the mapping tools.

The EEA has already uploaded large amounts of data onto Eye on Earth for free and accessible use. This includes data on water, air, climate change, biodiversity and land use. Other organisations which have also \u00a0uploaded data include the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC), the U.S. Geological Survey and the Abu Dhabi government. Data from new European observation satellites may also be added in the future. The web service is aimed at everyone, from scientists to academics, NGOs to individuals. Moreover, Eye on Earth does not just display data \u2013 it is also a platform where individuals and organisations can upload their measurements and observations, filling crucial gaps. It aims to \u2018crowd source\u2019 information from individuals across the world, and bring in data from many different groups, including \u2018citizen science\u2019, indigenous knowledge and lay expertise. Rob Bernard, chief environmental strategist at Microsoft, said: \u201cTransforming information into insight is essential if we are to address society\u2019s massive environmental challenges.\u00a0 By leveraging not only new technologies enabled by cloud computing, but also doing so in a way in which user interaction is both simple and powerful, the EEA, Microsoft and Esri are hoping to revolutionize the way in which people can understand critical information about our planet.\u00a0\u00a0 We are excited and honoured to be able to provide technologies that help citizens become more aware of the environmental impacts happening where they live.\u201d Jack Dangermond, President of Esri, said: \u201cAs soon as you open the portal you enter an interactive geospatial environment that has map tabs and search tools. You can start playing with maps and data right away, opening a base map, adding map layers, and publishing. You may even join a map group. Suddenly you realise that this network is going to change the way we study environmental problems and talk about solutions.\u201d The Eye on Earth global public information service created by the EEA and partners is distinct from the Abu Dhabi summit of the same name, although the summit name is inspired by the EEA project and the substance of discussion is closely related. The summit will address environmental and societal information and networking, and its importance for decision-making. The EEA is actively involved in summit preparations and discussions. It is hoped that the summit will provide an impetus for information sharing in the lead up to Rio+20, a sustainable development summit to be held next June on the 20th anniversary of the first historic Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.

It also helps meet the material demands of economic production, preventing the environmental impacts associated with extracting and refining virgin materials. Revenues from recycling are substantial and growing fast. From 2004 to 2008 the turnover of seven main categories of recyclables almost doubled to more than \u20ac60 billion in the EU. Due to a reduced demand for raw materials and a decline in commodity prices during the economic downturn the turnover of recycling declined sharply at the end of 2008 and in the first half of 2009 but seems to have recovered somewhat since then. The growth of recycling is being driven by increasing demand for recyclables, as booming Asian economies help to push up the price of materials. Another driver has been EU waste directives, which have contributed by creating obligations to recycle or recover increasing percentages of waste, and discouraging landfilling. As a consequence, the amount of recyclables sorted and placed on the market has increased 15 % between 2004 and 2009. More jobs at higher income levels are created by recycling than compared to landfilling or incinerating waste. Overall employment related to the recycling of materials in European countries increased by 45\u00a0% between 2000 and 2007. Recycling can meet a large proportion of the economy\u2019s resources demand, alleviating pressure on ecosystems to provide resources and assimilate waste. Recycling already meets substantial proportions of demand for some resource groups, notably paper and cardboard, and iron and steel. However, even maximum recycling cannot cover all EU demand for resources. Increased recycling can improve 'resource security', but economic growth driven by ever increasing material consumption cannot be sustained, as it requires an infinite volume of resources. Recycling is particularly valuable in securing supplies of critical resources. Recycling of rare metals is essential for the EU to pioneer new technologies, particularly in areas such as e-mobility, information and communication technologies and renewable energy. Imports of precious metal waste into Europe increased 50 % between 2000 and 2009 \u2013 the only group of recyclable materials which grew significantly during this period. However, rare and precious metals are characterised by dissipative use, meaning that they are used in small amounts in a multitude of applications and products. The existing recycling infrastructure has not yet focused on this problem, meaning that many of these metals are lost. The economic, social and environmental benefits of recycling highlight the need to \u00a0shift to a green economy in order to generate prosperity while maintaining a healthy environment and social equity for current and future generations.

Onshore wind and biomass electricity installed capacity to double, with solar photovoltaic capacity to triple over the same period. A greater part of Europe\u2019s electricity will come from the sea, as wave and tidal energy are projected to increase 11-fold. The electricity-generating capacity of concentrated solar power will increase 11-fold. Heat pump output will triple while geothermal heat and solar thermal output will approximately quadruple. Despite these growth rates, the 2020 targets will be met by just a narrow margin according to the projections, highlighting the challenge facing Europe as it aims to reduce its dependency on fossil fuels. Approximately 43 % of all renewable energy production is planned for heating and cooling, with biomass accounting for 80 % renewable heating and cooling output. Transport will make up the smallest proportion of renewable energy consumption (12 %), but is expected to be the fastest growing element between 2005 and 2020.

The report evaluates the role of climate change in altering characteristics of extreme events, looking at a wide range of options used by institutions, organisations, and communities to reduce exposure and vulnerability to climate extremes while improving resilience. The report uses carefully calibrated language to describe the robustness of key findings, which depends on many factors such as the completeness of weather observations and the level of agreement between different climate models. Findings from the summary report include: It is virtually certain that increases in the frequency of warm daily temperature extremes and decreases in cold extremes will occur throughout the 21st Century on a global scale. Authors cited a medium level of confidence that droughts will intensify over the coming century in southern Europe and the Mediterranean region, as well as central Europe and several other world regions. It is likely that heavy precipitation will increase in the 21st century over many areas of the globe, including in winter in the northern mid-latitudes. Projected precipitation and temperature changes imply changes in floods, although overall there is low confidence at the global scale that climate change will alter the magnitude or frequency of river related flooding. This uncertainty is due to limited evidence and the complexity of the causes of regional changes. Economic losses from weather- and climate-related disasters vary from year to year and place to place, but overall have increased, authors said with a high level of confidence. They also expressed similar confidence in the fact that total economic losses from natural disasters are higher in developed countries; however economic losses expressed as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are higher in developing countries. Deaths from natural disasters occur much more in developing countries (high level of confidence). Economic losses from weather- and climate-related disasters have increased in the long-term, as people and economic assets have been increasingly exposed to risks. For example, more people are living where they may be adversely affected by disasters (high level of confidence). There was a high level of agreement that \"Many measures for managing current and future risks, when implemented effectively, make sense under a range of future climates\". These \"low regrets\" measures include systems that warn people of impending disasters; changes in land use planning; sustainable land management; ecosystem management; improvements in health surveillance, water supplies, and drainage systems; development and enforcement of building codes; as well as better education and awareness. Risk management works best when tailored to local circumstances. Combining local knowledge with additional scientific and technical expertise helps communities reduce their risk and adapt to climate change (robust evidence, high level of agreement). \u00a0 In January 2011, the European Environment Agency (EEA) published a report which found that the frequency and damages from disasters had increased in Europe between 1998 and 2009.

By using existing tools employed by policy-makers to estimate harm to health and the environment, we revealed some of the hidden costs of pollution. We cannot afford to ignore these issues. Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The report, 'Revealing the costs of air pollution from industrial facilities in Europe', provides a list of the individual facilities that contribute the most harm. \u201cOur analysis reveals the high cost caused by pollution from power stations and other large industrial plants,\u201d Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said. \u201cThe estimated costs are calculated using the emissions reported by the facilities themselves.

The industrial facilities covered by the analysis include large power plants, refineries, manufacturing combustion and industrial processes, waste and certain agricultural activities. Emissions from power plants contributed the largest share of the damage costs (estimated at \u20ac66\u2013112 billion). Other significant contributions to the overall damage costs came from production processes (\u20ac23\u201328 billion) and manufacturing combustion (\u20ac8\u201321 billion). Sectors excluded from the EEA analysis include transport, households and most agricultural activities \u2013 if these were included the cost of pollution would be even higher. Key findings Air pollution by the facilities covered by EEA\u2019s analysis cost every European citizen approximately \u20ac 200-330 on average in 2009.\u00a0 Countries such as Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom, France and Italy, where a high number of large facilities are located, contribute the most to the total damage costs. However, when damage costs are weighted in an attempt to reflect the productivity of national economies, the ordering of countries changes significantly. The emissions from countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Estonia, Poland and the Czech Republic are then relatively more important with regard to the damage costs.\u00a0 A small number of individual facilities cause the majority of damage costs. Three quarters of the total damage costs were caused by the emissions from just 622 industrial facilities \u2013 6 % of the total number. The facilities with emissions associated with a high damage cost are in most cases some of the largest facilities in Europe which release the greatest amount of pollutants.\u00a0 Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions contribute the most to the overall damage costs, approximately \u20ac63 billion in 2009. Air pollutants, which contribute to acid rain and can cause respiratory problems - sulphur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3), particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) - were found to cause \u20ac38-105 billion of damage a year. \u00a0 Figure 1. Locations of the 191 E-PRTR facilities that contributed 50 % of the total damage costs estimated in 2009 Calculating economic costs from emissions The report uses publicly-available data from the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR). The analysis builds on existing policy tools and methods, such as the methods developed under the EU\u2019s Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) programme. Based on the different methodologies, it calculates a range of estimated damage costs arising from air pollutant releases reported by nearly 10 000 individual facilities to the E\u2011PRTR. The pollutants examined are regional air pollutants (NH3, NOx, PM10, SO2, volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs)), heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and nickel), organic micropollutants (benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dioxins & furans), and CO2. Certain aspects of harm to health and the environment are excluded from the scope of this study, such as the health and safety aspects associated with occupational exposure to air pollutants. For regional air pollutants for example, the model framework underpinning the assessment should be extended in the future to include aspects such as a valuation of ecological impacts and acid damage to culturally significant buildings and monuments. The recognised benefits of industrial facilities, including manufacturing products, employment and tax revenues, are not addressed in the report. \u00a0\u00a0 Figure 2. Cumulative distribution of the 2 000 E-PRTR facilities with the highest damage costs \u00a0 Context/Note to editor It is important to note that the report does not assess whether the emissions from industrial facilities included in the E-PRTR are consistent with the legal permitting conditions for the operation of these plants. The EEA has recently released a number of other publications addressing various aspects of air pollution in Europe. These include: The report: \u2018Revealing the costs of air pollution from industrial facilities in Europe\u2019 Report summary for policymakers The \u2018Air Quality in Europe \u2013 2011\u2019 report summarising Europe\u2019s air quality status The \u2018Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism (TERM)\u2019 report that explores the environmental impact of transport \u2018Air pollution impacts from carbon capture and storage (CCS)\u2019, assessing the potential impacts on air pollutants from the introduction of CCS in Europe.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/industrial-air-pollution-cost-europe"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0468", "date": "2011-11-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Carbon capture and storage could also impact air pollution", "text": "Carbon capture and storage can bridge the gap for the next few decades, cutting emissions until we can shift to a low carbon economy. Our report shows that while CCS may have an overall positive effect on air pollution, emissions of some pollutants may increase.

Professor Jacqueline McGlade EEA Executive Director \"Carbon capture and storage can bridge the gap for the next few decades, cutting emissions until we can shift to a low carbon economy\", Professor Jacqueline McGlade EEA Executive Director said. \"Our report shows that while CCS may have an overall positive effect on air pollution, emissions of some pollutants may increase. Understanding these types of trade-offs are extremely important if we are to deploy this technology across Europe and the world.\" What does CCS mean for air pollutants? CCS technologies require approximately 15 \u2013 25 % more energy depending on the particular type of technology used, so plants with CCS need more fuel than conventional plants. This in turn can lead to increased 'direct emissions' occurring from facilities where CCS is installed, and increased 'indirect emissions' caused by the extraction and transport of the additional fuel. The EEA report identifies some of the potential benefits and trade-offs for the main air pollutants. It also presents a life-cycle case study for 2050 considering three different scenarios, showing the potential impacts on emissions of air pollutants if CCS were widely implemented in Europe. Key findings include: Sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions from power plants are predicted to fall when carbon dioxide (CO2) is captured, as SO2 must also be removed after the fuel combustion stage for technical reasons. Although the extraction and transportation of additional coal will lead to higher SO2 emissions from these stages of the CCS life-cycle, SO2 emissions should decrease overall. Particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are expected to increase in line with the amount of the additional fuel consumed if no additional measures to reduce emissions are installed. Ammonia (NH3) is the only pollutant for which a significant increase in emissions is expected to occur, with emissions potentially increasing by a factor of 3 or more. The foreseen increase is due to the degradation of the amine-based solvents used to capture the CO2. However, in absolute terms the increase is small compared to existing ammonia emissions in Europe, 94% of which comes from agriculture. Ammonia contributes to acidification and eutrophication of the environment and also can form harmful fine particulate matter when released in the atmosphere. \u00a0 Potential carbon dioxide (CO2) savings from CCS vary greatly across the three scenarios in the report. Emissions of CO2 in the EU would fall by around 60 % by 2050 if CCS were implemented at all coal-based power generation plants. Implementing CCS at all coal, gas and biomass plants would result in net negative emissions \u2013 in effect removing CO2 from the atmosphere. This assumes that all biomass is harvested sustainably without any net changes to the carbon stock. The case study also shows clearly that the extraction and transport of additional coal can contribute significantly to the life-cycle emissions for coal-based CO2 capture technologies.\u00a0 Overall, however, CCS is considered to be generally beneficial both in terms of climate change and air pollution. However, the potential increase in certain pollutants such as NH3, NOx and PM is important. Carbon capture and storage technologies are assumed to play a central role in helping Europe achieve its long-term GHG reduction objectives in a cost-effective way, reducing domestic GHG emissions by 80-95 % by 2050. Implementing CCS is therefore considered as a bridging technology, and should not introduce barriers or delays to the EU\u2019s objectives of moving toward a lower-energy and more resource-efficient economy. In the EU, there are plans to build several demonstration plants for CO2 capture and storage in order to commercialise the technology from 2020. Currently, there are around 80 large scale CCS projects at various stages of development around the world but only a few are operational. There are as yet no large-scale CCS plants in operation which cover all three elements of the CCS chain \u2013 the capture, transport and storage of CO2.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/carbon-capture-and-storage-could"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0469", "date": "2011-11-17", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The European environment \u2013 state and outlook 2010", "text": "All key facts\u00a0 \t\t Search SOER Advanced search Free text search Browse by topic Climate Change Nature and biodiversity Land use Soil Marine and coastal environment Consumption Material resources and waste Freshwater Air pollution Urban environment Global megatrends Browse geographically Browse SOER geographically Regions Alpine region Carpathians Baltic sea Europe World Countries A-F Albania Austria Belgium Bosnia and Herzegovina Bulgaria Croatia Cyprus Czechia Denmark Estonia Finland North Macedonia France Countries G-M Germany Greece Hungary Iceland Ireland Italy Latvia Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Malta Montenegro Countries L-Y Netherlands Norway Poland Portugal Romania Serbia Slovakia Slovenia Spain Sweden Switzerland Turkey United Kingdom Synthesis The SOER 2010 Synthesis provides an overview of the European environment's state, trends and prospects, integrating the main findings of SOER 2010.

To improve air quality further, we need to use many different kinds of policies and measures. These could include reducing emissions levels at source, better urban planning to reduce people\u2019s exposure and lifestyle changes at the individual level. Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director Although emissions have fallen over the last two decades, this has not always led to a corresponding drop in pollutant concentrations in the air. This is particularly true in the case of particulate matter (PM) and ground-level ozone, as there is a complex relationship between emissions and air quality. Ozone and PM are the most problematic pollutants for health, potentially causing or aggravating cardiovascular and lung diseases and leading to premature death. Eutrophication, an oversupply of nutrient nitrogen in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is another major problem caused by air pollutants. Ammonia (NH3) from agriculture and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from combustion processes are now the main acidifying and eutrophying air pollutants, as sulphur pollution has fallen in recent years. Many air pollutants also contribute to climate change. \u201cEurope\u2019s air quality is generally getting better, but concentrations of some pollutants are still endangering people\u2019s health,\u201d Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said. \u201cTo improve air quality further, we need to use many different kinds of policies and measures. These could include reducing emissions levels at source, better urban planning to reduce people\u2019s exposure and lifestyle changes at the individual level.\u201d\u00a0 Key findings of the report Particulate matter: Twenty per cent of the EU urban population lives in areas where the EU air quality 24-hour limit value for PM10 concentration was exceeded in 2009. For the 32 member countries of the EEA, the estimate is 39 %. However, 80-90 % of the EU urban population is exposed to levels of PM10 which exceeded the more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines. This situation does not seem to be improving. Ozone: Ozone is not directly emitted but instead is the product of chemical reactions between other gases. Although man-made emissions of many of these \u2018precursors\u2019 has declined, ozone levels did not fall significantly between 1999 and 2009. Approximately 17 % of European citizens live in areas where the EU target for ozone concentration was exceeded in 2009. If ozone levels are compared to the more stringent WHO guidelines, more than 95% of the EU urban population was exposed to ozone exceeding this level. About one third of the total arable land in the 32 EEA member countries was also exposed to levels of ozone above the EU target level. Sulphur dioxide (SO2): From 1999 to 2009, Europe cut SO2 levels by roughly 50 %, leading to declines in acid rain and reduced acidification. Very few EU urban citizens are exposed to levels of SO2 above the EU limit value, although 68-85 % of the EU urban population is potentially exposed to levels above the WHO guidelines. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2): Concentrations of NO2 have declined slightly in recent years. Exceedances occurred usually at hot-spots, such as main roads. Twelve per cent of the European urban population live in areas with urban background (non-traffic) concentrations of NO2 exceeding EU and WHO levels. Heavy metals: Atmospheric levels of arsenic, cadmium, lead and nickel are generally low in Europe. However, heavy metal levels can build up in soils, sediments and organisms. Despite considerable cuts in emissions of heavy metals since 1990 in the EU, a significant proportion of European ecosystems are still at risk of heavy metal contamination.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/ozone-and-particulates-most-serious"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0472", "date": "2011-11-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "European transport sector must be ambitious to meet targets", "text": "Emissions levels of almost all pollutants from transport fell in 2009, as there was a drop in demand. But this fall was due to the economic recession. So now we need to see a more fundamental shift in Europe\u2019s transport system, so that emissions do not increase even in times of strong economic growth. Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director \"Emissions levels of almost all pollutants from transport fell in 2009, as there was a drop in demand,\u201d Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said. \u201cBut this fall was due to the economic recession. So now we need to see a more fundamental shift in Europe\u2019s transport system, so that emissions do not increase even in times of strong economic growth.\" The EEA report on transport and the environment shows that some efficiency gains have been made. For example, new cars in 2010 were approximately a fifth more efficient than in 2000. However, these relatively modest gains are often outpaced by growing demand, even if the recession slowed activity in some areas. Between 1990 and 2009, demand for transport grew by approximately one third, leading to a 27 % increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs) from transport in the same period. New targets proposed in the Commission\u2019s Roadmap will frame policy making at the European, national and municipal level in order to tackle environmental issues connected to transport. The report shows there are significant opportunities for policy makers to address these problems coherently, for example by addressing air quality and climate change together. For the first time, the EEA has developed a baseline to assess progress towards the transport sector\u2019s environmental targets. These include targets for greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption and noise. A core set of 12 indicators has been developed, spanning a wide range of policy areas. Key findings Transport was responsible for 24 % of all EU GHG emissions in 2009. The Roadmap states that EU Member States are required to reduce GHGs from transport by 60 % by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. Since emissions actually increased by 27 % between 1990 and 2009, the EU must make an overall 68 % reduction between 2009 and 2050. Annual energy consumption from transport grew continuously between 1990 and 2007 in the EEA member countries. While total energy demand from transport fell 4 % from 2007-2009, the upward trend is likely to resume with economic growth. Air quality objectives were exceeded in many areas. For nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which can cause asthma and other respiratory problems, the annual limit values were exceeded at 41 % of traffic monitoring stations in 2009. Particulate matter (PM10) from transport also causes serious health problems. In 2009 the daily limit value for PM10 was exceeded at 30 % of the traffic sites across the EU-27. Almost 100 million people were exposed to damaging long-term average levels of noise from road vehicles on major roads. The average real price of road transport fuels (calculated as unleaded petrol equivalent, inclusive of duties and taxes) was EUR 1.14 per litre in June 2011, in real terms 15 % higher than in 1980. This means that the price of petrol has increased by less than 0.5 percentage points per year in real terms on average, meaning that fuel prices are not sending strong signals to encourage more efficient transport choices. The share of alternative fuelled cars on the road has grown steadily, comprising more than 5 % of the fleet in 2009. Most of these were using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), while electric vehicles made up 0.02 % of the total fleet. Roads, railways and motorways are cutting up Europe\u2019s landscape into ever smaller parcels, with serious consequences for biodiversity. Nearly 30 % of land in the EU is moderately, highly or very highly fragmented, restricting movement and breeding of many different species. \u00a0 Notes for editors The TERM report in context \u2018Laying the foundations for greener transport\u2019 is the latest in an annual series of reports published by the European Environment Agency under the Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism (TERM). The European Annual Air Quality Report 2011 provides an overview and analysis of air quality in Europe. The evaluation of the status and trends of air quality is based on ambient air measurements (1999-2009), in conjunction with anthropogenic emissions and their trends (1990-2009). The TERM report includes a chapter on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from cars. In coming weeks, the EEA will release updated data on manufacturers\u2019 progress towards CO2 targets for new cars. This will be published on www.eea.europa.eu. In 2012, the TERM report will track progress against the baseline established in this report for the first time. Definitions Transport GHG emissions were defined in the Kyoto Protocol agreement as the emissions from the combustion and evaporation of fuel for all transport activity, regardless of the sector, but excluding international aviation and maritime transport (international bunker fuels). The GHG emissions target for transport in the Commission\u2019s Roadmap is defined as the emissions counted under the Kyoto Protocol, plus international aviation (but excluding international maritime transport).

It shows several successful examples of how European countries are giving increasing attention to using long term approaches, such as scenario building, when formulating environmental policies. The natural environment though is very complex and problems often develop slowly over time. As policy makers look further into the future, uncertainties multiply, and the possibility grows of unexpected surprise events. At the same time, electoral cycles are short, so longer term objectives are often ignored and short-term objectives may be prioritised, particularly when there is a lot of pressure to do so from external organisations and lobbyists. Some countries have attempted to address these challenges by setting up new institutional arrangements. For example, Portugal has integrated the Department for Foresight and Planning (DPP) in the Ministry responsible for Environmental Affairs, while the Finnish government has created the Parliament Committee for the Future and the Government foresight report. The report notes the environment public sector is increasing its capacity for futures thinking and striving to make futures studies more relevant in policy.

It focuses on the management of household waste - including hazardous materials - demonstrating how even small efforts by local people can make a big difference in waste management and protecting the environment. Only 25 % of household waste in Greenland is delivered to recycling stations, so the EEA hopes its new film will inspire residents, in particular youth and children in Greenland and across the Arctic region to change their behaviour. The film will also be supplemented with some educational material for schoolchildren. The 12 minute film was introduced by EEA Executive Director Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, and Hon. Anthon Frederiksen, Minister of Domestic Affairs, Nature and Environment in Greenland.\u00a0 Waste management challenges Sound waste management in remote areas like the Arctic is always going to be costly. Large-scale modern waste management systems cannot just be copied wholesale from elsewhere in Europe or North America. Greenland, with its harsh natural environment and dispersed population requires unique solutions tailored to the country\u2019s context. Because the huge distances and costs involved, much of the waste in Greenland has been (and in many cases continues to be) tipped into landfills just outside city or settlement limits. And without waste separation, household waste is often mixed with more hazardous waste types like batteries, leftover paint, nail polish or other chemicals. These hazardous materials can affect the health of the local population when they enter the air through incineration or seep out of landfills which often lack protective layers to avoid leakage. Chemicals can seep down towards the coastal waters where Arctic people catch the fish, shrimp and sea mammals which make up a large part of their diet. However, there are also some positive stories. For example, 99 % of all plastic and glass bottles used on the west coast of Greenland are returned to recycling plants, making country an inspiring example to the rest of the world. The film considers this complex situation, proposing solutions which allow Greenlanders to manage waste without damaging their natural environment. Greenland is famous for its awe-inspiring natural landscapes, but this environment is extremely fragile, making the case for better waste management even more urgent.

However, there is significant disagreement in the scientific community about whether mobile phone use increases the risk of head cancers. We recommend using the precautionary principle to guide policy decisions in cases like this. This means that although our understanding is incomplete, this should not prevent policy makers from taking preventative action. David Gee, EEA Senior Advisor on Science, Policy and Emerging Issues The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a global authority on cancer, recently concluded that radiation from mobile phones is a \u2018possible\u2019 head cancer risk. However, scientific opinion is split on the issue \u2013 many different studies have reached different conclusions based on the same evidence. The European Environment Agency (EEA) recommends taking a precautionary approach to policy making in this area. This position is based on an evaluation of the existing evidence and on the lessons from earlier hazards, analysed in the EEA \u201cLate Lessons from Early Warnings\u201d project. \u201cMobile phones have numerous social, economic and even environmental benefits\u201d, said David Gee, EEA Senior Advisor on Science, Policy and Emerging Issues. \u201cHowever, there is significant disagreement in the scientific community about whether mobile phone use increases the risk of head cancers. We recommend using the precautionary principle to guide policy decisions in cases like this. This means that although our understanding is incomplete, this should not prevent policy makers from taking preventative action\u201d. Why do scientists disagree? One reason scientists disagree is because the mechanisms by which the radiations from mobile phones could cause cancer are not yet understood. However, waiting for that knowledge could take decades: the biological mechanisms connecting tobacco smoke and cancer are still not fully understood, some 60 years after the first published studies linked smoking and lung cancer. Another area of uncertainty is the design of animal studies, investigating the effects of electro-magnetic fields (EMF) from mobile phones and cancers. A few studies suggest a positive link, but many others fail to find any. But even if all animal studies were negative, this would not necessarily indicate a negative result in humans, as human reactions can be very different compared to those of animals. For example, animal evidence of smoking and lung cancer came only after evidence in humans was established. Human studies may be inconclusive for several reasons. For example, any brain cancer effects of prolonged mobile phone use could take many years to develop and analyse, whereas mobile phones have only been in widespread use for a couple of decades. The evidence linking smoking or asbestos and lung cancer only became clear 20-25 years after first mass exposures began.\u00a0 Nonetheless, there are some examples of scientifically rigorous research which already indicate a risk from mobile phones. As the EEA has often noted, potential early warnings such as these should not be ignored, especially given the serious and irreversible nature of any cancer effects and the large numbers exposed, which includes vulnerable groups such as children. \u00a0 The precautionary principle Because the evidence on mobile phones and cancer presents a mixed picture, the EEA recommends using the precautionary principle (PP), as recommended in the EU Treaty, to better manage the risk. There is no clear legal definition of the PP so the EEA has produced a working definition: The precautionary principle provides justification for public policy actions in situations of scientific complexity, uncertainty and ignorance, where there may be a need to avoid, or reduce, potentially serious or irreversible threats to health and the environment, using an appropriate strength of scientific evidence, and taking into account the pros and cons of action and inaction. The PP requires us to weigh evidence in a different way. This is not new - societies are used to using different strengths of evidence for different reasons, based on the costs of being wrong. For example, criminals must be found guilty \u2018beyond all reasonable doubt\u2019 before they are convicted; \u00a0injured people in compensation cases need only show a balance of evidence in order to win compensation for negligence; while\u00a0 doctors only need slight evidence of a serious\u00a0 illness to prescribe treatment. Such precautionary approaches are justified where it is not yet possible to establish causality beyond reasonable doubt. \u00a0 Implications for policy makers and the mobile phone industry Citizens could be better informed about the risks of mobile phone use, as recommended by the EEA in September 2007.\u00a0 There is sufficient evidence of risk to advise people, especially children, not to place the handset against their heads:\u00a0 text messaging, or hands-free kits lead to about ten times lower radiation levels, on average, than when the phone is pressed to the head.\u00a0 Governments may also wish to label mobile handsets as a \u2018possible carcinogen\u2019, in line with the IARC decision. \u00a0In addition, more independent research is needed. The cost of these measures is very low, but the potential costs of inaction may be very high.

Janez Poto\u010dnik, European Commissioner for the Environment In coming years, societies will have to confront a huge challenge.

The European Commission\u2019s recent Resource Efficiency Roadmap states that while \u201cdemand for food, feed and fibre may increase by 70 % by 2050, 60 % of the world\u2019s major ecosystems that help produce these resources have already been degraded or are used unsustainably.\u201d Such unchecked resource use will increase environmental destruction and inequality; and ultimately lead to the disappearance of the natural and mineral resources which support modern societies.\u00a0 To address this problem, countries across Europe have been working on strategies and policies to become more resource-efficient. When responding to the survey, countries cited several reasons for attempting to become more resource efficient, including concerns about environmental degradation, economic reasons or shortages of a critical resource such as water. \"Transforming Europe into a sustainable economy will require concerted action at all policy levels,\u201d Janez Poto\u010dnik, European Commissioner for the Environment, said. \u201cMember States have an essential role in getting resource efficiency measures across to businesses and citizens. This survey shows that we are not starting from scratch and illustrates how this transition can be done in so many ways to match different national contexts.\" Some of the initiatives described by respondents include: Germany has targets to double the productivity of abiotic raw materials and energy by 2020.Denmark aims to be fossil fuel-free by 2050, and proposes using \u00a040 % of animal manure for green energy by 2020. In the building sector, Denmark stipulates that all new buildings will use 75 % less energy than in 2009.Finland has a comprehensive plan to use natural resources \u2018more intelligently\u2019 and intends to increase energy efficiency by 20 % within a decade. The Nordic country also states that all public buildings that are new, under renovation or leased must reach exacting passive standards by 2015.Sweden aspires to recover at least 60 % of phosphorus compounds from wastewater for use on productive land by 2015.Hungary plans to reduce annual generation of waste by 20 %.Austria has a target to cut final energy consumption by 16 % by 2016.Ireland has a programme which promotes mutually beneficial partnerships between businesses, building a network which encourages companies to reuse each other\u2019s surplus products, by-products and reusable items and share services, space and logistics.Croatia considers the Adriatic sea, coast and islands as resources of strategic importance for sustainable developmentPortugal\u2019s construction and demolition waste legislation obliges owners, works contractors and municipalities to properly manage the waste produced during construction and demolition.Latvia intends to become EU leader in preserving, increasing and sustainably using natural capital. \u00a0 A total of 31 countries from across Europe responded to the survey. There is no single accepted definition of resource efficiency, so answers showed the huge variety of different approaches. However, this diverse approach may be appropriate, as every country has different resources, economic situations and needs. The EU thematic strategy on the sustainable use of natural resources \u00a0defines natural resources as \u201craw materials such as minerals, biomass and biological resources; environmental media such as air, water and soil; flow resources such as wind, geothermal, tidal and solar energy; and space (land area).\u201d For most countries, resource efficiency was seen as part of other strategies, including strategies related to sustainable development, environment, raw materials, climate change and economic reform. The sectors of energy and waste were the two most common areas for resource efficiency policies. Nonetheless, the survey showed that Europe still has a long way to go if it is to make comprehensive plans for resource efficiency. According to the results, only a few countries have policies addressing the more fundamental issue of consumption, instead attempting to improve technical efficiency.

Alongside renewable energy or energy efficiency, efforts to reduce water pollution from agriculture also led to emission reductions. This experience shows we can reduce emissions further if we consider the climate impacts of various policies more systematically. Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The latest analysis of greenhouse gas trends in the EU was published by the EEA today in \u00a0three reports which together analyse emissions levels since 1990 and look forward to the EU's greenhouse gas emission reduction target for 2020 and beyond. They also cover progress towards Kyoto Protocol targets, early estimates for 2010 emissions levels and an analysis of drivers of emissions since 1990. Overall, EU emissions declined by 15.5 %. EU-15 emissions were 10.7 % below base year levels, still well below its collective 8 % reduction target for the 2008\u20132012 period. However, of the 15 EU Member States with a common commitment under the Kyoto Protocol (the 'EU-15'), Austria, Italy and Luxembourg were still lagging behind their Kyoto Protocol targets at the end of 2010. Looking ahead to 2020, EU Member States will have to implement planned measures to achieve the Union\u2019s unilateral 20\u00a0% reduction commitment, itself a precursor to the much deeper emission cuts needed in the long run to build a low-carbon economy. \"Many different policies have played an active role in bringing down greenhouse gas emissions\", Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said. \"Alongside renewable energy or energy efficiency, efforts to reduce water pollution from agriculture also led to emission reductions. This experience shows we can reduce emissions further if we consider the climate impacts of various policies more systematically.\" \u00a0 Key findings First estimates for 2010 show EU greenhouse gas emissions increased by 2.4 % compared to 2009 (with a margin of error of +/- 0.3 %), due to the return to economic growth in many countries and a colder winter leading to an increased heating demand. However, the increase in emissions was contained by a move from coal to natural gas and the sustained strong growth in renewable energy generation. In the EU-15, emissions were 10.7 % below base year levels (1990 in most cases), which is well beyond the collective 8 % reduction target. Countries which are not on track towards their target (Austria, Italy and Luxembourg) should make more efforts to ensure compliance, either by further reducing emissions or by relying more on the Kyoto Protocol's flexible mechanisms. EEA member and cooperating countries that are not part of the EU and agreed to a Kyoto target were on track by the end of 2009, apart from Liechtenstein and Switzerland. The latter has already decided to increase its use of flexible mechanisms to comply with its target. Measures in sectors not covered by the EU\u00a0ETS, for example in the transport, residential or waste sectors, will be of particular importance for meeting national targets for 2020 set under the EU's 2009 climate and energy package. EEA's trend analysis shows that greenhouse gas emissions have been strongly influenced by economic development in the past two decades. However, recent trends are also showing signs of the positive impacts of EU policies on its emission trends, according to the EEA analysis. Notes to the editor The three reports published today by the EEA provide a comprehensive picture on the past and future developments of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe: The EEA technical report \"Approximated EU GHG inventory: Early estimates for 2010\" presents the first figures on 2010 greenhouse gas emissions in the EU, following the publication of consolidated 2009 emission data in June. Final 2010 data will be available in May 2012, with the submission of the EU greenhouse gas inventory report to the UNFCCC. The EEA report \"Tracking progress towards Kyoto protocol and 2020 targets in Europe\" is tracking the progress already achieved or expected by European countries towards greenhouse gas emission targets. The EEA analysis underpins the European Commission's own report on this issue, also published today. The EEA report \" Greenhouse gas emissions in Europe: a retrospective trend analysis for the period 1990\u20132008\" presents an overview of drivers behind EU greenhouse gas emissions since 1990, with a particular focus on the influence of policies at EU level. Background on EU emission reduction commitments Under the Kyoto Protocol, the EU-15 has a common commitment to reduce emissions on average by 8 % between 2008 and 2012 compared to emissions in the 'base year' (mostly 1990). All of the EU-12 countries except Cyprus and Malta have national emission targets under Kyoto but the EU-27 does not have a common target under the Protocol and therefore the EU-27 does not have an applicable base year against which to compare emission changes. Emission changes compared to 1990 are relevant for the EU-27 as it has made a commitment to achieve at least a 20\u00a0% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 (or even 30 %, if the conditions are right). This target is also one of the headline targets of the Europe 2020 strategy. About the European Environment Agency (EEA) The EEA is based in Copenhagen.

This is changing - the European Directive on Ambient Air Quality and Cleaner Air for Europe (2008) places more emphasis on the use of models as a complement to monitoring data in order to conduct air quality assessment, forecasting and planning. There is a pressing need to harmonise the way these models are applied since they have been used in various forms and with differing and often incomparable quality assurance methods across Europe, at both national and local levels. The Forum for Air Quality Modelling in Europe (FAIRMODE) was established in 2008 in order to facilitate model comparability, documentation and reliability. FAIRMODE is a joint initiative of the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). The FAIRMODE technical reference guide published today is an output of that initiative. It provides a general overview of the use of models with regard to the EU\u2019s Air Quality Directives. The report includes a list of first recommendations for developing model evaluation protocols. As modelling methods and data sources improve, it is expected that models will increasingly be used by those working to improve air quality. This report and future guidance documents from FAIRMODE are intended to support this development by providing recommendations and clarifications. How are air quality models used? Assessing the existing air quality situation \u2013 for example showing exceedances of EU or national air quality standards, calculating population exposure to pollution and health impacts, and identifying contributions of air pollutants from different sources.Air quality forecasting \u2013 many national, regional and local authorities have established forecasting systems to warn the public when air pollution episodes are expected.Air quality planning \u2013 identifying possible measures to reduce emissions, and developing emissions reduction scenarios.

Countries have recognised the need to both develop and sustain their environmental monitoring systems, and also create the right policies for greening the economy by sharing data. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director Ministers agreed to extend the Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS). SEIS is a system for bringing together huge volumes of data and information from governments, scientific organisations, businesses and citizens. The European Environment Agency (EEA), the European Commission and Member States have been using the ideas underpinning SEIS to gather data over the last 5 years. In the Ministerial Declaration, the EEA was given the mandate to develop the future of environmental reporting in the region. Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said: \u201cThe Ministerial Declaration is an important turning point for environmental protection in the region. Countries have recognised the need to both develop and sustain their environmental monitoring systems, and also create the right policies for greening the economy by sharing data.\u201d The summit had two major themes: green economy and sustainable management of water and related ecosystems. The EEA supported the conference with a report entitled 'Europe's Environment \u2014 Assessment of Assessments', which aimed to demonstrate the quantity and quality of environmental information. A large number of countries committed to improving water management through diverse actions. Examples include water treatment plants (Moldova), increasing water efficiency (Finland) and new planning regulations for flood plains (Hungary). Alongside a commitment to SEIS, the final declaration recommended boosting investment in the water sector. Ministers also confirmed their countries would take the lead in transforming their countries to a green economy, noting the importance of \u201cdecoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation\u201d. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the \u201cEnvironment for Europe\u201d process, which is organised by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). There are 53 UNECE member countries in the pan-European region, covering the European Union, neighbouring countries, the Caucasus, Western Balkans, Central Asia, Turkey and the Russian Federation.

But even Dublin, capital of the 'Emerald Isle', has suffered from water shortages. A lot of water was being wasted, as tap water was free of user charges so there was little incentive for people to use water sensibly. Demand increased to such high levels that Ireland considered investing hundreds of millions of euros in new water transfers. However, the Irish government will soon introduce water pricing, which aims to achieve two objectives \u2013 cutting water consumption, so making new water transfer infrastructure less urgent, while also providing a new revenue stream. Low income groups could be compensated directly ('green checks' for instance), which will be more effective than providing free access to common goods. In addition, this may in fact be more equitable - rich people have more bathrooms, bigger gardens and larger cars to wash, so they benefit relatively more if not the resource is properly priced. This example illustrates the potential for improving the environment using economic instruments, which is the topic of a conference hosted by the European Environment Agency (EEA), 15-16 September, 2011. The conference will focus on using environmental fiscal reform to drive innovation in European companies, encouraging both production and consumption of environmentally friendly and energy efficient products. In addition, it will consider ways of positively communicating environmental fiscal reform. Conference speakers include Connie Hedegaard, European Commissioner for Climate Action, and Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. Economic instruments and environmental innovation Economic instruments such as taxes, user-charges, deposit-refund systems and emissions trading are among the strongest tools available for integrating environmental concerns directly in the operation of a market economy. They may not always guarantee that very specific quality measures are met, but the mechanisms can help businesses, industry and consumers make more sustainable choices. Moreover, implementation can be much smoother than imposing detailed regulations. Indeed, such policy innovation can drive technical innovation, urgently needed across Europe. Presently Europe imports far more materials and energy for its consumption than it exports, with an environmental and an economic cost. As these raw materials are becoming more expensive, it is doubly important to decouple this consumption from economic growth. Europe also needs increasingly comprehensive systems for recycling of materials, products and waste to take advantage of the raw materials that have been brought to Europe. In addition to more general discussion on environmental fiscal reform, the conference also includes a number of special sessions looking at the revision of the Energy Tax Directive. The conference is co-organised by Green Budget Europe and the Danish Ecological Council. Sponsors include the EEA, the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), Rockwool International and thinktank Concito. \u00a0 Link: \u00a0Green Budget Europe Annual Conference", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/green-budgets-the-potential-for"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0483", "date": "2011-09-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Increasing fragmentation of landscape threatens European wildlife", "text": "For the first time, this report presents the extent of landscape fragmentation across an entire continent using a scientifically sound method. It reveals the most relevant driving forces behind fragmentation, demonstrating that varying factors are relevant in different parts of Europe. The picture it paints is worrying. Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency (EEA) As new roads and railways criss-cross Europe, the further fragmentation of the landscape increases the isolation of animal populations in smaller and more vulnerable fractions. This also increases the number of animals killed in collisions with vehicles, and transport routes block their access to resources and breeding mates. These problems are compounded by the growing area taken up by transport infrastructure and the area bordering these developments \u2013 many animals cannot live in the fringe areas. Moreover, landscape fragmentation also facilitates the spread of invasive species and reduces the ecosystem services that human society relies on. Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency (EEA), said: \"Landscapes change constantly but in recent decades humans have often shaped them with little thought to the cumulative impacts and at a pace that is unprecedented.\" \"For the first time, this report presents the extent of landscape fragmentation across an entire continent using a scientifically sound method. It reveals the most relevant driving forces behind fragmentation, demonstrating that varying factors are relevant in different parts of Europe. The picture it paints is worrying.\" The brown hare in Switzerland is an example of a species which has been pushed to the brink of extinction by landscape fragmentation in combination with other human impacts such as intensive agriculture. The animals' movement has been blocked by roads, so they find it more difficult to escape bad weather, and they are often killed by vehicles. Extinction of the Swiss brown hare may be impossible to avoid as the 'point of no-return' may have been crossed. Indeed, animal populations often react slowly to changes in their habitat, so the current decline may be due to changes that occurred several decades ago, with further decline in animal populations across Europe to come as a result of more recent increases in landscape fragmentation. However, it is not all bad news - the report also presents some positive stories. For example, badgers in the Netherlands were in decline for many years, until a 'defragmentation policy' was established in 1984, encouraging developers to build 'badger pipes' to allow easier and safer movement of these shy animals. The Dutch badger population has since increased slightly. Landscape fragmentation: a mixed picture across Europe The highest levels of fragmentation are found in the Benelux countries, followed by Malta, Germany and France. Romania, dominated by the Carpathian Mountains, has successfully avoided large-scale landscape fragmentation. The country's 13 national parks and more than 500 hundred protected areas mean that the country provides the habitat for 60 % of bears, 40 % of wolves and 35 % of lynx in Europe. The UK is extremely varied \u2013 it has the some of Europe\u2019s highest levels of fragmentation around London, while the Scottish Highlands are some of the least fragmented areas. Low population densities, mountains and remote areas mean Scandinavia has generally very low levels of landscape fragmentation. Mediterranean countries like Spain, Greece and Italy have a medium level of landscape fragmentation overall, with greater fragmentation in many built-up coastal areas. In East and Central Europe, there are ambitious road building plans. For example, Poland has an unprecedented motorway building programme, representing 40 % of the road building market in the region in coming years. This may further divide the remaining patches of habitat unless measures are taken to preserve connectivity and compensate for the habitat loss. Although the situation is critical, there are several proactive policies for more effective protection of remaining unfragmented areas, and wildlife corridors which could successfully reverse the trend of growing fragmentation. Developers should build more tunnels, passages and bridges to allow animals to move more freely, the report says. In addition, planners should aim to upgrade old roads instead of building new roads, and \u2018bundle\u2019 new infrastructure, for example by building bypasses close to settlements or constructing road and rail routes next to each other. Where the volume of traffic has fallen, roads should be reduced in size or dismantled completely. Most importantly, cumulative effects need to be considered more effectively in the future, based on the precautionary principle, to avoid repeating mistakes of the past. The problem of landscape fragmentation is also considered by the recently-adopted European Union Strategy on Biodiversity and Ecosystems, where green infrastructure features prominently.

Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA The Ministerial Conference will bring together delegates from 53 countries across the pan-European region as well as delegates from the United States, Canada and Israel. The conference focuses on the challenges in protecting water and related ecosystems, and on how to move towards a green economy. It is organised by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) in cooperation with the Government of Kazakhstan. To support the Conference, the EEA was asked to produce a report entitled \u2018Europe\u2019s Environment \u2013 An Assessment of Assessments\u2019. This report provides a comprehensive overview of available sources of environmental information across the region which directly relate to the focus of the Conference. In writing this report, experts looked at more than 1000 reports, more than half of which were reviewed in detail. This report, which was produced with the support of the UNECE Steering Group on Environmental Assessments, is complemented by a series of regional reports that focus on specific pan-European sub-regions. Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA, said: \u201cThe Assessment of Assessments report shows that we need to further strengthen the link between policy and information.

Our ability as a society to successfully meet this challenge depends on having access to relevant, credible and legitimate environmental information and assessments from across the region.\u201d Europe's environment \u2013 an Assessment of Assessments The Assessment of Assessments focuses on the themes of water and water-related ecosystems, and greening the economy. It concludes by making a number of\u00a0 recommendations on how to enhance the knowledge base that underpins decision-making processes, improve assessment tools, and ensure greater information exchange across the pan-European region and at a global level. The report also documents the benefits of a \u2018Regular reporting Process\u2019 of environmental assessment, based on the Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS) which was a collaborative initiative of the European Commission, the EEA, and EEA member and cooperating countries. Such an approach would streamline and improve existing information systems and processes while making information available to policy makers and public across the region. Based on the findings of the Assessment of Assessments, it is expected that Ministers at Astana will decide to establish a regular process of environmental assessment and to develop SEIS across the region. Water \u2013 key findings Sustainable management of water and water-related ecosystems is extremely important across the pan-European region. Drought has increased in recent years across Southern Europe and Central Asia, while flooding is causing increasing deaths and economic damage. Clean water is also a problem, as an estimated 120 million people across the region live without access to safe drinking water or sanitation. There is a huge range of information on the state of water, produced by countries across the region. Authors of the report analysed more than 300 water-related reports from 48 countries, published over the last five years. However, information is often lacking or irrelevant to policy. Many assessments are currently too restricted to environmental status and trends and need to focus more on measures and management, especially regarding water scarcity, extreme events and water ecosystems. Green economy \u2013 key findings The \u2018green economy\u2019 is still an emerging concept. At its core is the idea of revitalising economies as they emerge from the recent economic crisis while significantly reducing environmental risks and addressing ecological scarcities. Globally, greening the economy is at the heart of renewed efforts to integrate environmental and social considerations with mainstream economic decision-making, up to and beyond the Rio 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. Information on the green economy is generally fragmented and still somewhat limited. While several assessments exist that look at environmental impacts of different economic sectors, there remains a notable lack of reports that coherently assess progress towards a green economy across these sectors. \u00a0 Notes for editors Initiated in 1991, the 'Environment for Europe'\u00a0(EfE) process is a unique pan-European forum for tackling environmental challenges and promoting broad horizontal environmental cooperation, as a pillar of sustainable development in the region. It is a partnership of states, intergovernmental organisations, regional environment centres and civil society, including the private sector. It supports convergence of environmental policies and approaches, while helping countries of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia and South-Eastern Europe to improve their environmental performance. Pan-European assessment reports on the state of the environment, produced by EEA, in cooperation with partners, for the EfE Conferences in 1995, 1998, 2003 and 2007 helped to identify major threats and challenges for the development of regional environmental policies.

Although this potent GHG can be captured and used to generate energy, much of it escapes into the atmosphere where it has a powerful climate forcing effect. Reducing the amount of waste going to landfill is therefore an important objective of EU waste policies. Nonetheless, waste volumes continue to rise across the EU. The average EU citizen generated 468 kg of municipal solid waste in 1995, which increased to 524 kg in 2008. This could rise to 558 kg per person by 2020 unless effective policies are put in place to reduce waste generation. The report takes a \u2018life-cycle approach\u2019 to calculating emissions from waste, considering all direct emissions from waste during processing and transport. In addition, it also accounts for emissions that are avoided in other parts of the economy \u2013 for example, accounting for the reduction of emissions when fossil fuels are displaced by energy recovered from waste. In this way, the method can show the potential impacts of various waste management strategies. Especially recycling leads to avoided emissions. This is because recycling materials from municipal waste avoids emissions that would have been generated in extracting and processing virgin raw materials and these avoided emissions are higher than the emissions caused by the recycling processes. More details on the calculations, assumptions and data are available in this working paper.\u00a0 Three different scenarios for 2020 illustrate that the potential for GHG savings largely depends on how countries implement EU waste policies, in particular whether they meet the EU Landfill Directive targets to reduce landfill of biodegradable municipal waste. Key findings from three different scenarios In a business-as-usual scenario, net GHG emissions from municipal waste management would be cut by 44 million tonnes CO2-e until 2020 compared to 2008. The two main factors responsible for this improvement are reduced methane emissions from landfill and increased avoided emissions through recycling. If all countries fully meet the Landfill Directive\u2019s waste diversion targets, potential life-cycle GHG emissions from municipal waste management in 2020 could be cut by 62 million tonnes CO2-e, which equals 1.23 % of their total GHG emissions in 2008. A complete ban on landfilling could cut emissions even further, reducing potential net emissions from waste management in 2020 by 78 million tonnes CO2-e compared to 2008. For the sake of comparison, this is more than Hungary\u2019s total emissions in 2008. \u00a0 An analysis by the OECD , following a somewhat different but also life-cycle based approach, broadly confirms the findings of the EEA work, namely, that better management of municipal waste has a significant potential to reduce GHG emissions. Encouragingly, ever more municipal solid waste is recycled and less is landfilled. The EU recycled 17\u00a0% of its municipal solid waste in 1995 and 40\u00a0% in 2008. In that period, the amount going to landfill dropped from 68\u00a0% to 40\u00a0%. These improvements have already cut annual net GHG emissions by 48 million tonnes CO2-e between 1995 and 2008 in the EU-27, Norway and Switzerland. Kitchen and garden waste is the biggest fraction of municipal solid waste in most EU countries. This represents a sizeable opportunity to cut emissions through recycling and energy recovery \u2013 in 2008, 44 million tonnes of organic matter was composted, emitting 1.4 million tonnes CO2-e. If that had been subjected to anaerobic digestion, producing useful biogas, it could have cut 2 million tonnes CO2-e from Europe\u2019s emissions. In addition to climate concerns, increasing recycling and energy recovery also enhances resource efficiency, a main goal of the EU2020 strategy.

Sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions have fallen the most since 1990 (\u201380\u00a0%), followed by carbon monoxide (CO) (\u201362\u00a0%), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) (\u201355\u00a0%) and nitrogen oxides (NOx)(\u201344\u00a0%). For several pollutants the decline was particularly sharp between 2008 and 2009. For example, SOx emissions fell by 21\u00a0% mainly as a result of the economic recession which led to reduced energy demand and hence lower emissions from public power plants in Bulgaria, Poland, Romania and Spain. Similarly, emissions of other key pollutants from the electricity generating sector also fell significantly in 2009 \u2013 for example, NOx and primary particulate matter (PM) both by around 10 % between 2008 and 2009. However, it is worth noting that although emissions within the EU have fallen significantly, air quality can still be quite low, particularly in urban areas. Other key findings Emissions of NOx from road transport have decreased by 42\u00a0% since 1990, mainly due to the introduction of three\u2011way catalytic converters in passenger cars and stricter regulation of emissions from heavy goods vehicles across Europe. Nevertheless, road transport remains the most important source of the ozone precursors NOx and CO, contributing 42 % and 34 % respectively in the EU-27 in 2009. Moreover, NOx emissions from road transport have not decreased as much as originally anticipated, as highlighted by another recent EEA\u00a0report. In contrast to the road transport sector, NOx emissions from aviation have increased significantly since 1990. Emissions from both domestic and international aviation increased by 79\u00a0% between 1990 and 2009,\u00a0however between\u00a02008\u00a0and\u00a02009 these emissions fell by 6%, reflecting lower aviation activity as a result of the recession. Large proportions of certain pollutants come from so-called \u2018diffuse\u2019 sources, which are typically emitted over large areas from often indistinct sources. These can be difficult to abate, and\u00a0include NOx and primary particulate matter (PM) from road transport, CO and PM from households, and ammonia (NH3) from agriculture. In addition, the report notes the difficulty of compiling and comparing emission estimates for the EU-27 when Member States do not report complete data. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 What is the LRTAP Convention? The Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) aims to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution including long-range transboundary air pollution. The 51 Parties of the Convention, including the EU, are obliged to report emissions data for a large number of air pollutants. The main air pollutants and their effect on human health and the environment are listed here. The EEA assists the EU by preparing the emissions\u00a0inventory to be reported under the LRTAP Convention each year. Air pollutant emissions data viewer The EEA publishes the data from the inventory report in the\u00a0air pollutant emissions data viewer, a searchable web-based interface that simplifies access and analysis.

However, this change in the nature of governance also brings new challenges, regarding the sources of evidence used in policy-making. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA Changing environmental politics The pressures on the environment are becoming increasingly interlinked and globalised, requiring a new kind of environmental governance.\u00a0 The EEA has also released a supporting background report to the Global Megatrends assessment entitled Global Governance: the Rise of the Non-State Actors, which considers the implications of this phenomenon. It describes how non-state actors such as multinational corporations (MNCs), non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and scientific organisations are increasingly involved in global governance. These relatively new actors are now take part in formulating, negotiating and implementing policy at local, regional and global levels. \u00a0Evidence of this change can be seen in the number of NGOs holding advisory status to the UN Economic and Social Council, which has increased constantly from approximately 700 in 1992 to almost 3,200 now. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA, said: \u201cThe involvement of NGOs and other non-state actors in governance has increased dramatically over the last few decades. One of the main discussion points at next year\u2019s Rio 2012 sustainable development summit will be environmental governance, and we expect the model of multi-level, multi-stakeholder governance pioneered within the EU to be increasingly important globally. \u201cAll kinds of organisations should be involved in environmental protection, particularly as environmental problems become more complex and interlinked. However, this change in the nature of governance also brings new challenges, regarding the sources of evidence used in policy-making.\u201d \u00a0 New challenges on the horizon Other highlights from the Global Megatrends assessment include: Resource shortages \u2013 the EU has identified 14 materials which may be critical over the next 10 years, as resources within the EU are limited. They include several which are essential for hi-tech applications, such as gallium (used in photovoltaics and microchips), tantalum (microelectronic capacitors), germanium (fibre glass cables) and neodymium (high performance magnets). Another critical element is phosphorus, which is needed for manufacturing fertiliser. Many of these materials are only found in a handful of countries, potentially triggering political disputes. Human capital\u00a0 and quality of life\u2013 the populations of most countries will age significantly over coming years, demanding structural societal responses, to adapt to changes such as a shrinking workforce. Nonetheless, many developing countries will have substantial youth bulges in the short term. These demographic differences across the world, combined with growing economic and health disparities and climate change, are an increasing driver of migration. Technology is changing at an exponential rate, driving an \u201caccelerating race into the unknown\u201d. Innovation is of key importance for the environment, but environmental and health risks need to be regulated and managed appropriately. One example of this change is reflected in the growing number of patents in emerging economies. In addition, the mass adoption of new technologies is shortening. The telephone was invented 35 years before it was adopted by a quarter of the US population. This period is becoming shorter \u2013 the CD achieved the same widespread use within 12 years, and the Internet only seven years. Pollution is no longer a local or regional issue. Recently a plume of particulate matter-rich pollution was detected over Europe, where it had traveled from Asia across the Pacific, North America and the North Atlantic in only eight to 10 days. These atmospheric \u2018brown clouds\u2019 are predicted to increase, particularly across Asia. Chemicals burden to environment and human is rapidly expanding with effects which are poorly understood. These are some of the contributions from the EEA towards the ongoing preparation for the Rio 2012 global conference on sustainable development, which will focus on the linked aims of creating a green economy and global environmental governance.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/changing-environmental-governance-in-a"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0489", "date": "2011-07-15", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Hazardous substances in Europe\u2019s fresh and marine waters \u2013 an overview", "text": "Hazardous substances in water affect aquatic life and can pose a threat to human health Hazardous substances are emitted to fresh and marine waters through a range of pathways and from a variety of sources, including industry, agriculture, transport, mining and waste disposal, as well as from our own homes. Hazardous substances found in fresh and marine waters and associated sediment and biota include a wide range of industrial and household chemicals, metals, pesticides and pharmaceuticals. Some substances, for example tributyltin (TBT), persist in aquatic environments long after they have been phased out. Hazardous substances can have detrimental effects on aquatic biota. Substances with endocrine-disrupting properties, for example, can impair reproduction in fish and shellfish, while the effects of organochlorines on marine life are well documented. Such impacts diminish the services provided by aquatic ecosystems, including the provision of food. Humans can be exposed to hazardous substances in water, through ingesting contaminated drinking water and consuming contaminated freshwater fish and seafood. Some metals have been found in seafood above regulatory levels, whilst levels of banned substances such as DDT can also be high. Legislation is in place but faces new challenges Well-established legislation within Europe has led to positive outcomes including a reduction in emissions of metals to air and water. Legislation implemented more recently, including the Water Framework Directive and REACH (Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) will play a key role in addressing hazardous substances in water.\u00a0 For some pollutants, awareness of potential effects has only emerged recently and scientific understanding may still be incomplete. These \u2018emerging pollutants\u2019 include substances that have existed for some time, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, but also relatively new ones such as nanomaterials. Policy makers need more information on the levels and effects of these emerging pollutants. Better understanding is needed too, with regard to the effects of chemical mixtures which are found in the more polluted water bodies of Europe. In the absence of appropriately strong measures, climate change is likely to adversely affect chemical water quality over the coming decades. More intense rainfall, for example, is predicted to increase the flushing of hazardous substances from both urban and agricultural land. The report concludes that to reduce hazardous substances in water, a more sustainable production and use of chemicals\u00a0should be applied both in Europe and beyond. This global approach would not only benefit Europe's environment but also reduce detrimental effects arising in other parts of the world, because a growing proportion of goods consumed within Europe are produced outside its borders. Adopting sustainable green chemistry techniques can also play an important role, although there is currently no comprehensive EU legislation in this area.

Road transport alone accounted for about one fifth of total EU CO2 emissions in 2009 and its \u00a0emissions increased by 23% between 1990 and 2009. In 2009, the EU adopted targets for average CO2 emissions of new passenger cars as part of its strategy to reduce emissions from transport. The legislation sets target values of 130 grams CO2 per kilometre [gCO2/km] to be met by 2015 and of 95 gCO2/km by 2020. These target values will be phased in gradually. Detailed data submitted by EU Member States under this legislation is made available today in a public EEA database. An analysis of the data shows that: The average CO2 emissions of a new passenger car in the EU27 were 140.3 gCO2/km in 2010. An average new passenger car emitted 5.4\u00a0gCO2/km, or 3.7% less than in 2009 when average emissions were145.7 gCO2/km.The difference between average CO2 emissions of new diesel and new gasoline vehicles is 3.3 gCO2/km. This gap is considerably lower than a decade ago, when the difference was 17 gCO2/km.Vehicle registrations decreased by 2.3 million in 2010 compared to 2007, considered to be the last year before the economic recession. The majority (95%) of the registration took place in the EU-15, where a new passenger car emits 7.9 gCO2/km less than a new car registered in the EU-12.Alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) can be tracked in more detail. In 2010, approximately 13000 flex fuel vehicles (vehicles working with several types of fuel such as ethanol and gasoline) and 700 electric vehicles were registered in the EU.The dieselisation of the fleet continued in 2010. The share of alternative fuel vehicles did not vary significantly compared to the previous year. Graph: Evolution of CO2 emissions from new passenger cars by fuel (EU27) AFV: alternative fuel vehicles; gCO2/km: grams CO2 per kilometre. \u00a0 What next? Manufacturers may notify the European Commission of any errors in the data reported by EU Member States. Confirmed data will be published by the European Commission and the EEA by 31 October 2011. The EEA will develop a data viewer, simplifying access to and analysis of the data. In May 2012, the EEA will publish the annual EU greenhouse gas inventory including verified CO2 emissions from the transport sector in 2010. In addition, the EEA is presently preparing for the reporting of CO2 emissions of light commercial vehicles (vans). The EEA expects the knowledge base on the vehicle fleet to improve over the next years with further legislation under consideration for emissions of other vehicle classes. Calculating targets for manufacturers As the data on 2010 CO2 emissions from new passenger cars are provisional, they cannot yet be used for calculating the overall target for manufacturers under the Regulation on emission performance standards for new passenger cars (Regulation (EC) No 443/2009).

Environmental projects like this show how social and environmental benefits often go hand-in-hand. Hopefully our positive experience can inspire other cities across Europe to start similar projects.\u201d Bees are a prime example of an undervalued service that nature delivers to human society. Together with other species (mostly insects but also bats and birds) bees play a key role as pollinators \u2013 enabling reproduction of plants, wild and domesticated. One attempt to price this service estimates the contribution of insect pollinators to agricultural output may be worth up to US$ 190 billion per year. Since the introduction of modern agricultural methods, new diseases and other environmental changes, bees have been in decline across Europe. These reasons are not fully understood and research is ongoing. However, there is some good news - urban beekeeping is increasing. Copenhagen is one of the most recent cities to embrace beekeeping, following Paris, Berlin and Hong Kong. The bees can find plenty of pollen in the parks and gardens of cities, and the honey is generally of a very high quality. In addition, urban beekeeping can raise awareness of the importance of pollinators and contributes to urban biodiversity. Commissioner Poto\u010dnik added: \"We take bees for granted, and the same goes for many other\u00a0 ecosystem services \u2013 the soil, air and water that nature provides for free. But we should take more care. Bees are signal species and when we fail to respect their lifestyle, they may no longer be able to help support ours. In the Environment Council this week, we discussed the new Biodiversity Strategy for Europe, setting out objectives and targets towards 2020.\u00a0 I sincerely hope that we can convince enough people that everyone needs to be part of protecting biodiversity, and that is why initiatives like this one \u2013 bringing nature to city centres \u2013 are so useful.\" Danish Minister of the Environment Karen Ellemann said: \u201cMy aim is to actively engage Danes in preserving all of our species. The annual value of pollination from Danish honey bees is estimated at one billion dollars, so it is therefore significant that 3.5 million bees are now being kept in Copenhagen. Urban beekeeping can raise people\u2019s awareness of the importance of pollinators and contribute to the crucial protection of biodiversity.\u201d The EEA has been keeping bees on its roof since April 2011. The two hives sit on the roof of the five-storey building in central Copenhagen, and during the summer are home to approximately 80,000 bees. These hives will provide an estimated 100kgs of honey per year. The hives are managed by the Bybi (Danish for \u2018City Bee\u2019) social enterprise, which trains formerly homeless people in beekeeping. Biodiversity is also one of the aims of the UN\u00a0International Year of Forests. To mark this event in 2011, the EEA has also given over its courtyard to an artistic installation representing a forest, featuring living birch trees.

Only 1.2% of coastal bathing water and 2.8% of inland sites were non-compliant. The remainder are unclassified due to insufficient data. In general, coastal bathing water quality deteriorated between 2009 and 2010 \u2013 the number of bathing water bodies meeting the mandatory values fell by 3.5%, while those meeting guide values fell by 9.5%. Inland water quality has also dropped. The number of rivers and lakes achieving the guide values fell by 10.2%, although compliance with the mandatory values was almost stationary. Rivers were particularly problematic, with only 25% of river bathing waters achieving guide values. Background Bathing water in Europe needs to comply with standards set in the Bathing Water Directive (2006/7/EC) adopted in 2006, which updates and simplifies previous legislation. The directive was to be transposed into the national law by March 2008, although Member States have until December 2014 to implement it. During the 2010 bathing season 20 Member States monitored and reported bathing water quality according to the new provisions. European citizens can find out about the water quality at their favourite swimming spot by checking the Water Information System for Europe (WISE). The site allows users to download data and check interactive maps, from the European level down to the individual monitoring station level. People can also report the state of their local water using the Eye on Earth website.

Like many other European countries, Greenland faces the challenge of improving its handling of waste. Modernising waste incineration is one important element, but there are many opportunities to improve the situation with more simple steps as well. For example, keeping hazardous waste like batteries, paints and electronic waste separate from overall waste now has top priority. This waste is then sent to Denmark for treatment. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade returned from Greenland today and has experienced that the government of Greenland, municipalities and other stakeholders are currently very active in investigating the most suitable solutions for waste management given the extreme climate and the vast distances between towns and villages in Greenland. Public interest in waste is rising, and one of the first steps will be to raise awareness of waste issues, among citizens and children in particular. The EEA film will contribute to this awareness-raising activity. Things are already changing. Although recycling plants are far away, increasing quantities of metals are separated from the waste stream and shipped to recycling plants in Europe, and authorities are investigating similar solutions for other waste materials. Closing the loop of metals is one small step towards a recycling society and a greener economy, in which waste is used as a resource rather than a burden. Making these changes in such a challenging environment can also provide lessons for the other Arctic countries.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/greenland-is-stepping-up-its"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0496", "date": "2011-06-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "More efforts required to reduce ozone pollution in Europe", "text": "Ozone is not directly emitted to the atmosphere but formed in complex photochemical reactions from ozone precursor gases (nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, methane and non-methane volatile organic compounds). Its production depends on meteorological conditions such as solar intensity and temperature. Elevated levels of ground-level ozone reduce agricultural crop yields and corrode infrastructure and cultural heritage. It can also cause health problems and lead to premature deaths. The new EEA report \u2018Air pollution by ozone across Europe during summer 2010\u2019 shows that the long-term objective to protect human health (maximum daily eight-hour mean concentration of 120 \u00b5g/m3) was exceeded in all EU Member States and in most of the other reporting European countries at least once during summer 2010. As in previous years, the most widespread concentrations occurred in the Mediterranean area. However, areas of western and central Europe experienced higher ozone concentrations than in 2009. Preliminary results show that 17 EU Member States (Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Spain) are facing difficulties in meeting the target value for protecting human health. In all these countries, the maximum daily eight-hour mean ozone concentration of 120 \u00b5g/m3 was exceeded on more than 25 days during summer 2010. Other key findings For the first time in four years, in 2010 the information threshold (a one-hour average ozone concentration of 180 \u00b5g/m3) was exceeded in northern Europe. The average number of threshold exceedances increased slightly in north-western, central and eastern Europe. The alert threshold (a one-hour average ozone concentration of 240 \u00b5g/m3) was exceeded 44 times in nine EU Member States with most exceedances in northern Italy and northern Portugal.Summer 2010 was characterised by a long period with numerous exceedances during the warm sunny weather experienced between 24 June and 22 July. This episode accounted for approximately 85 % of the total number of exceedances of the information threshold, 64 % of exceedances of the alert threshold and 52 % of exceedances of the long-term objective. \u00a0\u00a0 Target value for the protection of human health Directive 2008/50/EC on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe sets out the \u2018target value for the protection of human health\u2019. Specifically, as of 2010 the maximum daily eight-hour mean concentration of ozone should not exceed 120 \u00b5g/m3 on more than 25 days per calendar year, averaged over three years. It further specifies that the target value will first be calculated using validated data from 2010 and following years. Therefore it will not be possible to assess exceedance of the target value fully until data for 2010, 2011 and 2012 have been compiled and validated. Ozone pollution \u2013 not only a local air quality issue In Europe, ozone concentrations in a particular country are also influenced by emissions in other northern hemisphere countries and by poorly regulated sectors such as international shipping and aviation. Thus, ozone pollution is not only a local air quality issue but also a hemispheric and global problem. Data sources on emissions of ozone precursor gases The EEA publishes emissions data on the air pollutants that contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, available in several data viewers: NEC Directive viewer (NOx, NMVOCs), LRTAP Convention viewer (CO) and the greenhouse gas data viewer (CH4). Updated information on the trends in man-made emissions of ozone precursors NOx and NMVOCs are also available in the recently published NEC Directive status report 2010.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/more-efforts-required-to-reduce"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0497", "date": "2011-06-01", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Taking stock of our resource use on World Environment Day \u2013 5 June 2011", "text": "We need a long-term vision.

So we need to change, from consuming everything we want to just consuming the things we need.\u201d Some facts on resource use in Europe: Consuming even small amounts of resources can indirectly use large amounts of other materials.\u00a0 For example, producing one tonne of steel leaves behind a hidden flow of four tonnes of other materials, while this is a staggering 400,000 tonnes a tonne for platinum . Resource use is accelerating. Between 1980 and 2005, global resource extraction grew by 50 %, while experts predict\u00a0 that extraction will increase by approximately 75 % in the 25 years from 2005-2030. Europe is highly reliant on imported resources \u2013 in 2008, the EU-27 imported more than six times as much raw materials as it exports \u2013 bringing in 1 384 tonnes of materials, while exporting 203 million tonnes. As high quality ore deposits and easily accessible fossil fuel reserves shrink, more energy is needed to extract resources \u2013 leading to greater climate change impacts. The EU produces approximately six tonnes of waste for every person. However, increasing recycling and recovery turns more and more of this waste into resources in many countries. \u00a0 Europe needs to decouple resource use from economic growth, according to the State and Outlook of the Environment Report (SOER) published by the EEA in 2010. Although this may sound like a difficult and complex task, all European citizens can play a part.

The pollutants covered by the report harm both human health and the environment by contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone and particulate matter and leading to acidification and eutrophication. \u00a0 The NOx challenge The road transport sector bears most of the blame for the anticipated exceedances, contributing to more than 40 % of total EU-27 NOx emissions in 2009. Furthermore, although emissions from the sector have decreased since 1990, the reduction over the past 2 decades has not been as large as originally anticipated. This is partly because the sector has grown more than expected and partly because vehicle emission standards have not always delivered the anticipated level of NOx reductions. Even taking into account NOx control measures already in place within the Member States, the NOx emissions for the EU-27 are still projected to be 6 % above the aggregated Member States limits (known as the Annex I ceilings) and 17 % above the stricter ceiling for the European Union as a whole (the Annex II ceiling) set for 2010. Some Member States, such as the Netherlands and Slovenia, expect to exceed their respective NOx ceilings by only small margins (less than 5 %). In contrast, Germany and France expect to exceed their ceilings by 328 kilotonnes and 275 kilotonnes respectively - equivalent to exceedances of 31 % and 34 %. Austria, while expecting lower surpluses in absolute terms, anticipates exceeding its ceilings by an even larger margin (40 %). Other pollutants mostly on track For the other three pollutants (SO2 \u2013 primarily from fuel combustion for electricity generation and by industry, NMVOCs \u2013 from the use of solvents and from the road transport sector, NH3 \u2013 mainly from agriculture) the EU-27 projections are all below the emissions ceilings defined by the directive.

These data will allow a more reliable assessment of the emission reductions achieved by Member States. \u00a0 What next? The European Commission has recently launched a comprehensive review of its air policy, building on the 2005 Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution (TSAP) and Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) initiatives. This follows discussions and agreement within the Commission that further actions to improve air quality are a pressing need. The Commission plans to focus on a number of immediate measures and a more comprehensive review of EU's air policy by 2013 at the latest. This revision of policy, including the NEC Directive, is expected to propose stricter emission ceilings for 2020 in order to protect health and the environment further. It could also, for the first time, introduce a ceiling for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). In the absence of new legislation, however, the NEC Directive remains in force and requires that future emissions stay below national ceilings also after 2010. Separately, discussions over setting new 2020 national emission ceilings for European countries have started within the UNECE\u2019s Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution. NEC data viewer The EEA publishes the data from the NEC Directive status report 2010 in an air pollutant emissions data viewer, a searchable web-based interface that simplifies access and analysis. The data viewer allows users to compare emissions from different countries and their proximity to the emission ceilings.\u00a0 Links Information on the EU review of air policy Country fact sheets on air pollutant emissions", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/eu-to-exceed-nitrogen-oxides"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0499", "date": "2011-05-30", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Recession and renewables cut greenhouse emissions in 2009", "text": "Although much of the decrease in greenhouse gases is due to the recession, we are starting to see the results of many EU and Member States\u2019 proactive policies in renewable energy.

Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency, said: \"Although much of the decrease in greenhouse gases is due to the recession, we are starting to see the results of many EU and Member States\u2019 proactive policies in renewable energy. We hope that policy makers continue to build on this success to cut emissions further.\" The 2009 recession affected all economic sectors in the EU, leading to a decrease in energy demand. Consumption of fossil fuels fell compared to the previous year, mainly for coal, which in turn led to even steeper emission reductions. In relative terms, the largest emission reductions occurred in manufacturing industries and construction, and in public electricity and heat supply. Despite the relatively cold winter of 2009, emissions also fell in the residential sector. Alongside falling energy demand linked to the economic recession, there was a strong growth in renewable energy deployment, particularly biomass, wind and solar, leading to a significant increase in the share of renewables in final energy in the EU. Primary energy consumption of renewables increased by 5.8% in the EU-27, according to Eurostat energy balances for 2009. Key findings for 2009 The economic recession and the increase of renewable energy in final energy consumption were the main factors behind the fall in emissions in 2009.In the EU-27, total GHG emissions decreased by 17.4 % in the EU-27 between 1990 and 2009 (974 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent, or CO2-e). In line with EEA estimates made last year, emissions decreased by 7.1 % (-355 million tonnes CO2-e) between 2008 and 2009.In 2009, total GHG emissions in the EU-15[1] were 12.7 % (542 million tonnes CO2-e) below the base year level. Emissions decreased by 6.9 % (274 million tonnes CO2-e between 2008 and 2009.Emissions of GHGs from international aviation and shipping decreased by 8.6 % in the EU-27 between 2008 and 2009. These two sectors currently represent 6.3 % of total GHG emissions.

The EU ETS covers more than 12,000 power plants and manufacturing installations, or approximately half of all emissions. This rebound in emissions partly reflects the economic recovery. About the report The Greenhouse Gas Inventory is an annual report compiled by the EEA covering emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases from 1990 to two years before the current year. It is the official submission of the EU to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In autumn the EEA will publish early estimates for the 2010 emissions in the EU, and also a Trends and Projections report, looking ahead to assess progress against emissions targets.

By informing citizens about air pollution from transport, households and other sources where they live, these maps empower them to take action and urge authorities to make improvements.\u201d The E-PRTR, launched in 2009 to improve access to environmental information, contains data reported by individual industrial facilities (point sources) and, as of today, information on emissions from road transport, shipping, aviation, heating of buildings, agriculture and small businesses (diffuse sources). Diffuse sources of pollution are widespread and/or concentrated in highly populated areas. A large number of many tiny emissions from houses and vehicles represent collectively a large, diffuse source of pollution, in particular in cities. The new, comprehensive set of 32 maps allows Europeans to see on a scale of 5\u00a0km by 5\u00a0km where pollutants are released. They include details of nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulphur oxides (SOX), carbon monoxide (CO), ammonia (NH3) and particulate matter (PM10). What do the maps show? While air quality data are publicly available from both national and European data providers[1], these data do not provide information concerning the various sources of pollution. The new maps raise awareness about local releases of air pollutants, and allow citizens to zoom in on their own neighbourhood. In addition, air quality experts can use the data for modelling, thereby assessing the environmental consequences of local emissions. The spatial distribution maps reveal, for example, large hotspots for emissions of ammonia (NH3) from agriculture in the Po Valley in Italy, in Brittany in France, and the Benelux countries. High levels of ammonia emissions harm the environment by contributing to soil and freshwater acidification and eutrophication. They also show the extent to which NOX and PM10 emissions from road transport occur in large urban areas and along the main road networks. In cities road transport in particular contributes significantly to the levels of PM10 in the air we breathe. E-PRTR maps Background\u00a0 In 2003, parties to the Aarhus Convention \u2013 including the EU \u2013 adopted the Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTR), which entered into force on 8 October 2009. The EU has gone beyond the PRTR Protocol by requiring Member States to report information on an additional five pollutants to the 85 substances listed, and imposing more stringent reporting thresholds for another six. Information in the E-PRTR is updated in May each year. In addition to the 27 Member States of the European Union, it also includes data from Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Serbia started reporting to the E-PRTR in 2011. The website now includes the new information on diffuse source releases into air for 2008 covering key pollutants. Further information on diffuse source releases into water and soil will be included in coming years. About the European Environment Agency (EEA) The EEA is based in Copenhagen. The Agency helps achieve significant and measurable improvement in Europe's environment by providing timely, targeted, relevant and reliable information to policy-makers and the public. More information on the EEA About the Institute for Environment and Sustainability (IES) IES is based in Ispra and it is one of the seven scientific institutes of the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre (JRC). Its mission is to provide scientific and technical support to EU policies for the protection of the European and global environment.

The EEA is coordinating a debate on resource efficiency indicators, co-organised by the European Commission and Eurostat. Today Europe, like much of the industrialised world, is faced with a complex problem. Our economies depend on a continuous flow of raw materials which we no longer can take for granted. In addition, this rapid consumption of resources damages the environment and produces waste. So in an increasingly populated and resource-hungry world, efficient use of limited resources is more important than ever. Resources under pressure include non-renewable substances, such as metals, fossil fuels, chemicals and other minerals. Although other kinds of resources may be considered 'renewable', including clean water, air, animals and plant life, there are limits to the rate at which natural systems can regenerate these materials. In this way, resource efficiency cuts across traditional boundaries between environmental and economic ideas, exposing constraints and opportunities. The EEA recently released its State and Outlook Report (SOER) 2010, which showed how accelerating resource use could lead to environmental degradation, conflict and economic disaster. On average, Europeans use about 16 tonnes of material resources per year. Most predictions foresee continued growth in the use of material resources both in the EU and globally. Europe's demand has long exceeded its ability to generate the resources it uses. Today, 20 - 30 % of resources used are imported, and Europe's open economy relies heavily on imported raw materials, especially metals and fossil fuels. While some progress has been made in reducing the impact of this high resource consumption, such efficiency gains are wiped out by ever-higher demand for goods and services. Green Week has established itself as the leading conference on EU environmental policy, attracting participants from government, business, non-governmental organisations, academia and the media. The conference will also provide input to the Roadmap for a Resource Efficient Europe, a policy proposal being prepared by the European Commission. \u00a0 Related Items Material resources and waste \u2014 SOER 2010 thematic assessment Resource efficiency Green Week 2011", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/using-resources-more-efficiently-green"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0503", "date": "2011-05-19", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "A walk in the woods on May 22 - International Biodiversity Day", "text": "Biodiversity embraces the variety of genes, species and ecosystems that constitute life on Earth, and we depend on it completely for our livelihoods and well-being. Many of the planet's species are found in forest ecosystems, which also provide vital services for people across Europe \u2013 including cleaning our air, stopping soil erosion, filtering water and providing products like timber and food. But to see forests as purely a service or a source of goods belies their intrinsic value for maintaining biodiversity. To highlight their importance to life on Earth, the United Nations has declared 2011 as the International Year of Forests, while 2011-2020 has been designated the UN Decade on Biodiversity. Around one-third of the land area of EEA and collaborating countries is covered by forest, with the largest wooded areas located in Finland, France, Spain and Sweden. Of this area, only 5 % is undisturbed by significant human intervention. These old growth natural and semi-natural forests are particularly valuable for biodiversity and carbon storage. More than half of the forest species of 'European interest' and over 60 % of forest habitat types identified by the Habitats Directive are reported to be in 'unfavourable conservation status'[1]. Indeed, 27% of mammals, 10 % of reptiles and 8 % of amphibians linked to forest ecosystems are threatened with extinction in the EU. For some forests, climate change is the biggest threat to biodiversity. Rising temperatures are expected to affect the range of tree species. This is predicted to affect forests at latitudinal and altitudinal extremes, while forest fires are increasing at lower latitudes, for example around the Mediterranean. Increased periods of drought and warmer winters are likely to further weaken forests against invasive species. So what can be done to protect biodiversity in Europe's forests? Better forest management is needed in some areas \u2013 some European forests are intensive monocultures with very little biodiversity. In addition, reducing fragmentation of forests is also hugely important. When a forest is broken up into smaller patches, these sections are often unable to support the same broad biodiversity as a single forest of the same area. Europe has pledged to halt biodiversity loss completely on its territory.\u00a0As the magnitude of this task and the challenges become increasingly apparent, EU biodiversity policy has developed accordingly. To this end, the European Environment Agency (EEA) will increasingly focus on assisting policy-makers and others by delivering relevant and reliable data. However, European citizens can also play a role in protecting the plants and animals living in the forest.

Artificial land cover increased by 3.4 % in Europe in the period 2000\u20132006, by far the largest proportional increase in all land use categories.\u00a0 Contrastingly, farmland is decreasing in terms of area but is often managed more intensively, partly due to growing demand for bio-energy crops. Wetlands and biodiversity-rich natural and semi-natural areas also continue to decline, although at a slower rate than observed in the period 1990\u20132000. Land use changes in Europe have significant environmental implications, including polluting soil and water, and releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Landscape fragmentation and habitat destruction exert strong pressures on biodiversity. Decisions about land use involve trade-offs between diverse sectoral interests, including industry, transport, mining, agriculture and forestry. Managing these trade-offs in a way that maximises society\u2019s wellbeing \u2014 both today and in the years ahead \u2014 requires an integrated policy approach incorporating environmental considerations. Of course, designing and implementing an integrated policy approach is impossible without accurate information, including accessible data on land cover and analysis of land use changes. The EEA provides a range of tools for this purpose. New and updated tools for land use analysis Corine Land Cover 2006 is a family of products based on satellite imagery. Launched in 2010, this land cover inventory includes 44 different land cover classes and presents changes between the years 2000 and 2006. On 29 March 2011, the EEA published 36 land cover country analyses based on CLC 2006 data. Each of the country reports provides graphs and maps that characterise land cover changes concisely. The expansion of residential areas and construction sites is the main reason for the increase in urban land coverage in Europe. A new land take assessment published in February 2011 shows that the annual land take in 36 European countries was 111 788 ha/year in the period 2000\u20132006. A raster data set of built-up and non-built-up areas is available for assessing soil sealing. The Urban Atlas provides comparable land use and land cover data for more than 300 major cities in Europe. The city data are also displayed as maps in a viewer, which will be improved gradually to include all major EU cities by the end of 2011. The main purpose of land cover accounts is to understand changes over time. The land accounts data viewer 2000\u20132006 allows users to display and download land cover statistics derived from the land accounts methodology. \u00a0 Links SOER 2010 country land use assessments.

And the scale, speed and interconnectedness of global economic, social and environmental changes are creating unprecedented challenges. In stressing the economic, social and environmental dimensions of the shift to a global green economy, the UNEP report echoes some of the key findings of the EEA's flagship report The European Environment: State and Outlook 2010 (SOER 2010), published in November 2010. \u00a0 SOER 2010 highlights the twin challenges of maintaining the structure and functions of ecosystems (ecosystem resilience) and finding ways to cut resource use in production and consumption activities and their environmental impacts (resource efficiency). It also underlines that a successful transition in Europe requires that rich and poor alike have equal access to the benefits of a green economy. Greening Europe's economy is essential\u00a0for building\u00a0a sustainable\u00a0future globally and meeting the Millennium Development Goals and the aims of the Rio+20 agenda. But what would such a transition involve in Europe? In several respects the region looks comparatively well positioned. It is the world's largest economic bloc, with considerable innovation skills. It maintains a social-welfare model that emphasises equitable distribution of benefits across society. It has arguably the strongest package of environmental policies globally and a record of successful integration with economic sectors using market instruments and other tools. Moreover, the EU has a long tradition of managing socioeconomic transitions from its inception in the 1950s through to recent enlargements of the EU to the East.

The increase in losses can be explained to a large extent by higher levels of human activity and accumulation of economic assets in hazard-prone areas, but also, to a smaller extent, by better reporting. Although the share of losses attributable to climate change is currently impossible to determine accurately, it is likely to increase in the future, since the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are projected to grow. Key facts and findings In the period covered by the report, disasters caused nearly 100 000 fatalities, affected more than 11 million people and led to economic losses of about EUR 150 billion. Extreme temperature events caused the highest number of human fatalities. In total, more than 70 000 excess deaths were reported in Europe during the hot summer of 2003. Flooding and storms were the most costly hazards. The overall losses recorded in the study period added up to about EUR 52 billion for floods and EUR 44 billion for storms. The number and impacts of geophysical hazards appeared relatively stable during the period covered. Earthquakes caused most harm with almost 19 000 recorded fatalities and overall losses of about EUR 29 billion. Technological accidents caused the most severe ecosystem impacts. The oil spills from the tankers Erika (1999) and Prestige (2002) caused some of the worst ecological disasters in European waters and the toxic waste spills from the mining activities in Aznacollar, Spain (1999), and Baia Mare, Romania (2000), seriously affected the environment not only in the immediate aftermath, but also in the long term. Disaster risk reduction and management Although some EU policies have already been adopted or initiated, more effort is needed to implement an Integrated Risk Management (IRM) approach that includes prevention, preparedness, response and recovery for all hazards across Europe. Some measures are best suited to be managed at household or municipal level, such as the improvement of natural drainage to prevent pluvial flooding or suitable care and housing for elderly people that can buffer the effects of heat waves. Information gaps and data needs Successful disaster risk reduction and management rely on solid evidence.

Together, they account for around 50\u201366 % of total emissions of particulate matter, acidifying pollutants and ozone-forming gases. The EU introduced the Euro emission standards for road vehicles and directives on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) and Large Combustion Plants (LCP) to reduce air pollutant emissions from these sources. But how effective have they been? A new EEA study 'Impact of selected policy measures on Europe's air quality' aims to provide an answer, analysing how much these policies have reduced air pollutant emissions and improved Europe's air quality compared to a 'no-policy scenario'. It also explores how much better air quality could be if the policies were fully applied. Key findings Road transport Despite a 26 % increase in fuel use over the period 1990\u20132005, the introduction of the Euro vehicle standards has reduced road transport emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) by around 80 %, non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) by 68 %, nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 40 % and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) by 60 % compared to a no-policy scenario. Due to lower emissions, concentrations of particulate matter over Europe have also been reduced far below the levels that would have been observed had no policies been in place. This is mainly the case for densely populated areas in western European countries. Such significant reductions have not been observed in eastern Europe. Due to an overall decrease in the emissions of ozone precursors (CO, NMVOC, NOx), high daily ozone concentrations have become less frequent over most parts of Europe, especially in the Mediterranean region. Industrial combustion Current emissions of NOx and sulphur oxides (SOx) are significantly below the no-policy scenario. The reduction in particulate matter emissions from industrial combustion is more significant than from the road transport sector. The largest reductions have occurred in major industrialised areas such as Germany, Italy's Po Valley, the Netherlands and Poland. Europe's air quality has improved significantly in terms of both acidifying pollutants (NOx, SOx) and fine particulate matter. Concentrations of both pollutants groups would be around twice as high if no measures had been implemented. The potential of existing policies Emissions could be reduced much further if the latest Euro vehicle standards were fully applied in all European countries. This would mostly affect NOx emissions from gasoline\u2011fuelled vehicles and direct PM2.5 emissions from diesel\u2011fuelled vehicles. In many countries, NOx and SO2 emissions could be approximately halved if they were brought down to the requirements set out in the LCP legislation. Concentrations of PM2.5, the pollutant of major concern in terms of health effects, would decrease in most areas if countries reduced emissions to the requirements set out in the LCP legislation. As emissions in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands are already largely consistent with the LCP requirements, high reduction potentials are mainly found in southern and eastern Europe.

The seeds for future action exist: the task ahead is to help them take root and flourish. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of EEA The EEA's new assessment shows that global demands for natural resources to feed, clothe, house and transport people are accelerating. These mounting demands on natural capital are exerting increased pressure to ecosystems, economies and social cohesion in Europe and elsewhere. However, SOER 2010 confirms that well-designed environmental policies continue to improve Europe's environment without undermining Europe's growth potential. 'We are consuming more natural resources than is ecologically stable. This is true for both Europe and the planet as a whole. Climate change is the most visible sign of instability so far, but a range of global trends suggest greater systemic risks to ecosystems in future. The nature of the current financial crisis should give us pause for thought.' said Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of EEA. A complete shift to a resource-efficient green economy requires that all environmental resources \u2013 biodiversity, land, carbon, rivers, the seas and the air we breathe \u2013 are fully considered in production, consumption and global trade decisions. 'There are no quick fixes but regulators, businesses and citizens need to work together and find innovative ways to use resources more efficiently. The seeds for future action exist: the task ahead is to help them take root and flourish,' concludes McGlade. SOER 2010 also highlights a greater understanding of the links between climate change, biodiversity, resource use and people\u2019s health \u2014 and how tools like spatial planning, ecological tax reform, pollution prevention, precaution and resource accounting can underpin a natural capital-based approach to their management. Key findings and recommendations Climate change: The European Union has made progress in cutting emissions and expanding renewable energy. The EU-27's 2009 emissions stand 17 % below the 1990 level and therefore very close to the bloc\u2019s target of cutting emissions 20 % by 2020. However, sectoral trends are not all positive. EU-27 emissions from transport rose by 24% between 1990 and 2008. Climate change adaptation: Even if Europe meets all its emission reduction targets and world leaders agree on bold measures during the climate talks currently taking place in Cancun, Mexico, Europe will still need to adapt to ongoing and expected climate change impacts. Dedicated management of natural capital can help deal with these challenges. \u00a0Biodiversity, ecosystems and people\u2019s health: The Natura 2000 network of protected areas, which now covers around 18 % of EU land, has helped protect endangered species and preserve green spaces for leisure. Air and water quality legislation has reduced pressure on biodiversity and people. On the other hand, intensification of land use, loss of habitats and overfishing prevented the EU from meeting its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010. Integrated solutions with a global perspective: By showing the many links between different challenges, environmental and others, SOER2010 encourages us to increase integrated actions across different policy areas dealing with these challenges, so as to deliver improvements quicker and maximise co-benefits (e.g. mitigate climate change and improve air quality at the same time). Resource efficiency: Food, energy and water security are key drivers of land use as often conflicting demands increase (e.g. for food, feed and fuel). Accounting and pricing that takes full account of resource use impacts are essential for steering business and consumers towards enhanced resource efficiency. Citizen involvement: Policy alone cannot halt or reverse environmental trends. We need to increase the number of citizens committed to reducing their impact on the environment by involving them in collecting data and through social media.

The following year, hundreds of countries, signatories to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), committed themselves to reduce biodiversity loss significantly in the world by 2010. It is now clear that both targets have been missed. The 10th Conference of the Parties (COP-10) to the CBD opened its doors today in Nagoya, Japan, where the international community, including the EU, will be striving to agree on a post-2010 policy framework. The global discussions in Nagoya and the EU position in these negotiations will play a key role in the new EU biodiversity strategy, expected to be finalised by the end of 2010. Complementing the EEA's recently published report 'Assessing biodiversity in Europe' and the short-assessment series '10 messages for 2010', the EU 2010 Biodiversity Baseline provides policymakers with a starting point for measuring the state of biodiversity within the EU and unveiling major information gaps. The baseline supports the EU in developing the post\u20112010 sub\u2011targets and provides data for measuring and monitoring progress in the EU from 2011 to 2020. After 2010, regular updates of these data\u00a0will provide a clear historical record of progress. Key findings Species extinction in the EU is not occurring nearly as rapidly as in other regions and continents, but the percentage of species threatened with extinction still remains high. Among others, 25\u00a0% of marine mammals and 15\u00a0% of terrestrial mammals, 22\u00a0% of amphibians and 21\u00a0% of reptiles are threatened with extinction. Many fishery resources are still not being managed sustainably. Around 46\u00a0% of assessed European stocks fall outside safe biological limits and 88\u00a0% of species are overfished. Habitat fragmentation, degradation and destruction due to land-use change constitute the main pressures and drivers causing biodiversity loss. Corine Land Cover inventory indicates that areas of extensive agriculture, grasslands and wetlands are continuing to decline across Europe. Europe cannot meet its consumption demands from within its own borders and the gap between demand and production capacity has grown steadily since 1960. The impacts of changing climate are just beginning to emerge and the wider ecosystem implications have not yet been fully recognised. However, many ecosystems have been degraded, thereby reducing their capacity to respond to future shocks such as the effects of climate change. The establishment of the Natura 2000 network has progressed well in the terrestrial environment, with nearly 18\u00a0% of EU land designated. In the marine environment, the progress remains limited. EU legislation has helped reduce pressure on biodiversity. For example, acidification and eutrophication from excessive nitrogen accumulation are declining and nitrogen balances of farmlands are decreasing; water quality has improved in fresh waters, the state of freshwater systems is improving generally and the marine environment is stable.

These sectors are crucial for the EU targets set for 2020. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of EEA The EEA report 'Tracking progress towards Kyoto and 2020 targets' presents an overview of the progress actually seen in 2008 (and 2009 where data are available) in European countries towards their respective targets under the Kyoto Protocol. Based on aggregated emission projections at EU level, the report also presents an assessment of projected progress of the EU-15 towards its 8\u00a0% reduction commitment and of the EU-27 towards its 20 % reduction target by 2020. 'We cannot afford to wait until after the end of the Kyoto period to start implementing policies targeting sectors not covered by the EU\u00a0ETS, such as transport and residential heating. These sectors are crucial for the EU targets set for 2020,' said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. Key findings When looking at 2008 and 2009, the two first years of the Kyoto commitment period, the EU-15 appears to be well on track towards achieving its commitment of reducing emissions by 8 % compared to base-year levels. Together, the EU-15 countries are estimated to have reduced their average annual emissions over these two years by more than 250 million tonnes CO2 equivalent\u00a0beyond the reductions needed for achieving their common Kyoto target. This puts EU-15 collectively\u00a05.9\u00a0%\u00a0below the 8 % Kyoto reduction target.\u00a0 The figures take into account the planned use of the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s flexible mechanisms by governments (2.7\u00a0% of base-year emissions) and the expected sequestration of atmospheric carbon due to forestry activities (1.0\u00a0% of base-year emissions). However, failure by any EU-15 Member State to achieve its own burden-sharing target could jeopardize the possibility for the EU-15 to achieve its common target.\u00a0 Current emission levels and projections show that the EU is well on track towards achieving its 2020 reduction target of 20\u00a0% with emission reductions achieved in the EU territories only, provided that Member States fully implement the Climate and Energy package adopted in 2009. Recent estimates by the EEA also confirm this downward trend, with the EU-27\u2019s 2009 emissions expected to stand 17.3\u00a0% below their 1990 level. Based on their 2008 emission levels, almost all European countries with a Kyoto target were on track to meet their individual targets. However, three EU Member States (Austria, Denmark and Italy), two other EEA countries (Liechtenstein and Switzerland) and one EU candidate country (Croatia) need to step up their efforts before 2012 to be able to meet their targets.Because the allocation of emission allowances to the EU\u00a0ETS is already decided upon for the full period 2008\u20132012, reducing emissions in the sectors not covered by the EU\u00a0ETS \u2013 such as transport, residential heating, agriculture or waste \u2013 are necessary for achieving the Kyoto targets. The economic crisis largely contributed to the drop in total EU-27 greenhouse gas emissions in 2009 compared to 2008 (by 6.9\u00a0% according to EEA estimates), but its impact was felt less significantly in the sectors not included in the EU ETS (\u2013\u00a03.3%) than in the sectors included (\u2013\u00a011.7 %). Return to economic growth could temporarily level off or even reverse the decline in emissions, but the declining trend is expected to continue. Notes to the editor The EEA report 'Tracking progress towards Kyoto and 2020 targets' can be found at http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/progress-towards-kyoto/. The European Commission also publishes a report today assessing the EU's progress towards the Kyoto commitments, which takes into account actual emissions and projections to the end of the 2008-2012 commitment period, whereas the EEA report is based on actual emissions in 2008 (and 2009 where data are available). As such, the two reports complement each other. The EEA's report will be followed later in the year by an in-depth analysis of the links between historic emission trends and the policies and measures implemented in the EU. Background on EU emission reduction commitments Under the Kyoto Protocol, the EU-15 has a common commitment to reduce emissions on average by 8 % between 2008 and 2012 compared to emissions in the 'base year' (mostly 1990). Unlike the EU-15, the EU-27 does not have a common target under the Kyoto Protocol and therefore the EU-27 does not have an applicable base year against which to compare emission changes. Emission changes compared to 1990 are relevant for the EU-27 as it has made a unilateral commitment to achieve at least a 20\u00a0% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990.

Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of EEA The Agency's new report \"Assessing biodiversity in Europe \u2013 the 2010 report\"\u00a0 considers the status and trends of Pan-European biodiversity in a range of ecosystems, and the implications of these trends for biodiversity management policy and practice.

Secondly, policymakers need to understand what is driving biodiversity loss and how we can halt it,' said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA 'This cannot be made without embedding environment in the economy.' European biodiversity has declined dramatically in the last two centuries. Today, most of Europe's biodiversity exists within a mosaic of heavily managed land and highly exploited seascapes, largely linked to agricultural, forestry and fishery practices across the region. Major threats include habitat destruction and fragmentation, establishment and spread of invasive species, pollution from agricultural runoff, increasing water abstraction, over exploitation, and the increasing impact of climatic change. The policies adopted and implemented at international and European levels have had positive impacts on some aspects of biodiversity. For example, forest cover has significantly increased in the last two decades across northern Europe and the status of many waterways has improved as a result of reduced industrial and agricultural pollution. Recovery plans implemented for many threatened species have also had some success. Key recommendations Conservation measures, where implemented successfully, have had positive impacts. However, a large proportion of habitats and species still have an unfavourable conservation status, indicating the need to intensify conservation efforts. Conservation activities alone are insufficient to address biodiversity loss because many of the causes emanate from sectors beyond the control of conservation interventions. Other sectors impacting biodiversity, such as trade, agriculture, fisheries, transport, health, tourism and the financial sector must take the economic value of biodiversity into account and be reshaped to support biodiversity conservation. Policies and measures to address biodiversity loss must be formulated to address all the pressures and threats on an ecosystem, disregarding administrative boundaries on land and at sea, while ensuring cooperation across economic sectors. Filling knowledge gaps through further monitoring, research and assessment will enable better decision-making and policies on European biodiversity. Policy framework should be complemented by efforts to raise public awareness aimed at encouraging individual action and to boost public opinion for changes in policy. \u00a0 Related items Assessing biodiversity in Europe \u2013 the 2010 reportBISE10 messages for 2010", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/biodiversity-in-europe-policy-scope"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0528", "date": "2010-09-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Protecting Europe's cultural landscapes and biodiversity heritage", "text": "Tenth and last in the series of '10 messages for 2010', the EEA's new assessment \"Cultural landscapes and biodiversity heritage\" suggests that the concept of 'cultural landscapes' holds a central role in managing ecosystems and the services they provide us. Cultural landscapes: the combined work of nature and man UNESCO's World Heritage Committee defines cultural landscapes as geographical areas 'representing the combined work of nature and man'. The concept is particularly relevant in Europe, where large-scale human impacts on land starting in Neolithic times (c. 3000\u20131100 BC). Hunting, cultivation (of cereals, fruits and other crops) and settlements altered natural ecosystems and shaped Europe\u2019s landscape. Until the 18th century, European landscapes preserved many remnants and structures of the remote past. Since then, however, enormous technological and social changes have fundamentally altered land use. Transport infrastructure and urbanisation have fragmented habitats, while intensified agriculture has created a much more homogenised landscape, threatening the diversity of habitats, species and genes. An important element of the 'cultural landscape' concept is recognition that human activities are key drivers of changes in ecosystems \u2014 with potentially severe impacts on human wellbeing. But the concept also reflects the idea that human cultures are themselves shaped by their natural surroundings and ascribe huge value to local ecosystems for their spiritual, aesthetic and recreational properties. Appreciating the Parmigiano-Reggiano, feta, cheddar, gouda\u2026 Of course, in addition to cultural values, ecosystems also provide a lot of goods and services that are economically beneficial. For example, wild relatives of common crops can provide pest and disease resistance, while also increasing yields. Moreover, diverse local produce and traditional lifestyles also attract tourists eager to experience distinctive tastes and traditions. This in turn provides additional employment in rural areas, maintaining local population levels. Recognising the cultural and economic value of the natural world, it becomes clear that we owe it to our children and subsequent generations to preserve this 'biodiversity heritage'. Correspondingly, initiatives exist to protect European biodiversity heritage at various levels: from the European Landscape Convention to labelling and certification schemes that promote local produce and traditional activities. Incorporating such instruments and initiatives into regional and local planning and involving local communities will be essential to secure Europe\u2019s biodiversity heritage and maintain multifunctional landscapes.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/protecting-europe2019s-cultural-landscapes-and"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0529", "date": "2010-09-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Air pollutant emissions to exceed limits", "text": "Of the four pollutants covered by the NEC Directive status report 2009, EU Member States have the greatest difficulty meeting the emission limits for nitrogen oxides (NOx). Only 16 expect to remain within their respective NOx ceilings, with road transport bearing much of the blame. The road transport sector contributed around 40 % of total EU-27 NOx emissions in 2008 and although its overall emissions have decreased since 1990, the reduction has not always been as large as originally anticipated. This is partly because the sector has grown more than expected and partly because vehicle emission standards, especially those for diesel vehicles, have not always delivered the foreseen level of NOx reductions. Several Member States, including Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom, expect to exceed their respective NOx ceilings by small margins (less than 5\u00a0%). In contrast, France and Spain expect to exceed their ceilings by 261\u00a0kilotonnes and 236\u00a0kilotonnes respectively \u2014 equivalent to surpluses of 32\u00a0% and 28\u00a0%.

(1) \u00a0\u00a0 Member State emission ceilings are compared against reported 'with measures' (WM) projections. WM projections take into account currently implemented and adopted policies and measures. Where Member States have instead reported only 'business as usual' (BAU) projections, it is assumed for comparison with the ceilings that these are equivalent to a WM projection. Not all Member States have fully incorporated the effects of the recession into their projections for 2010. For these countries, decreased economic activity may improve the chances of meeting their obligations. What does the NEC Directive cover? The EU NEC Directive sets pollutant-specific and legally binding emission ceilings (limits) for four main air pollutants: sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and ammonia (NH3). These pollutants harm both human health and the environment by contributing to the formation of ozone and particulate matter and leading to acidification and eutrophication. Member States must meet the NEC Directive\u2019s ceilings by 2010 in order to deliver the originally agreed health and environmental benefits. What next? The Thematic Strategy on Air (TSAP) adopted by the Commission in 2005 lists a revision of the NEC Directive as an important action to achieve the health and environmental targets of the TSAP by 2020. This revision is expected to propose stricter emission ceilings for 2020 in order to protect health and the environment further. It could also, for the first time, introduce a ceiling for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). In the absence of new legislation, however, the NEC Directive remains in force and requires that future emissions stay below national ceilings after 2010. Separately, discussions over setting new 2020 national emission ceilings for European countries have started within the UNECE\u2019s Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution. NEC data viewer The EEA publishes the data from the NEC Directive status report 2009 in an air pollutant emissions data viewer, a searchable web-based interface that simplifies access and analysis. The data viewer allows users to compare emissions from different countries and their proximity to the emission ceilings Country fact sheets on air pollutant emissions These fact sheets summarise key data on air pollutant emissions separately for each of the EEA member countries.

For populations in lowlands, mountains regulate water flow, supply clean air and offer recreation and tourism opportunities away from cities. The new EEA report 'Europe's ecological backbone: recognising the true value of our mountains' presents a complete overview of the forces at play and their interactions, with a view to improving policies affecting Europe\u2019s mountain areas. How do you define a 'mountain'? European countries set different criteria for defining what constitutes a mountain. In addition, regional conventions covering the Alps and the Carpathians and EU legislation affecting mountain areas all define them differently. The new EEA study, presented at the 7th European Mountain Convention, uses topography and altitude criteria based on data from digital elevation models. According to that definition, 36 % of Europe\u2019s area and 29 % of the EU-27 are defined as mountainous. A significant part of the EU's mountain areas is protected under nature conservation schemes such as Natura 2000 or is classified as High Nature Value farmland. Most mountain areas in the EU are also designated as 'Less Favoured Areas', allowing them to benefit from EU development funds. Development pressures and climate change at play Mountains generally have relatively low population densities. In total 17 % of Europe\u2019s population (118 million people), and 13 % of the EU population (63 million) live in mountain areas. From 1990 to 2005, population density in mountains as a whole increased considerably but at country level it varied significantly. Although agriculture and forestry remain important for cultural identity and as a source of employment, especially in southern and eastern Europe, the service sector is actually the greatest source of employment in a large majority of EU countries. The economic isolation often associated with mountain areas has been partly overcome by EU initiatives such as the Trans-European Transport Network. Temperatures and snowlines have been rising in Europe\u2019s mountains, affecting mountain species and habitats. Climate change, changes in land use and hydropower development all impact the water retention and runoff in mountains, which in turn affect lowlands.

The key data have been extracted from the National Action Plans and made available for further analysis and comparison in a database. The main information is also presented in graphs and tables in a data report. The available data from the 19 National Action Plans show that: Electricity will make up 45 % of total renewable energy production, with wind power supplying 41 % of renewable electricity;43 % of all renewable energy production will be used for heating and cooling, with biomass accounting for 80 % renewable heating and cooling output;Transport will make up the smallest proportion of renewable energy production (12 %), but is the fastest growing element between 2005 and 2020.

We can no longer take these benefits for granted. Understanding the full value of what we are losing is a precondition for halting biodiversity loss. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of EEA All over the world, humans are altering the natural environment: clearing forests, ploughing fields, draining wetlands and building cities and roads. For the individuals involved, such activities and investments can generate valuable returns. But they also impose costs \u2014 many spread across society \u2014 by reducing the ability of ecosystems to provide services that sustain our lives and economies. 'Biodiversity loss has an impact on everything from food, water and energy production, to life-saving drug sources, to cultural and aesthetic benefits. We can no longer take these benefits for granted', says Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. 'Understanding the full value of what we are losing is a precondition for halting biodiversity loss'. Many economists believe that the core problem is that no markets or property rights regimes exist for many of the services that nature provides. Since we don\u2019t pay for the services, their value isn\u2019t reflected in our decision-making. Judgments about whether to alter the environment focus only on the private benefits, not the more broadly dispersed costs. Fortunately, the economists also offer a response to the problem, which involves determining the monetary value of ecosystem services. If we know the value then it can be reflected in decision-making and guide our stewardship of the natural world. \u2018The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity\u2019 (TEEB) study was launched with these considerations in mind. The latest TEEB report \u2018TEEB for Local and Regional Policy Makers\u2019 was presented today at an international biodiversity conference \u2018Biodiversity in a Changing World\u2019, organised by the Belgian Presidency of the European Union. To coincide with the publication of the new TEEB report, the EEA presented on a map viewing platform 35 sustainable development initiatives where the value of ecosystem services was taken into account during the decision phases of the initiatives. Background information on the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity The importance of ecosystem services for human well-being was highlighted in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) in 2005, which reported that at global scales, 60\u00a0% of the services examined in the study (15 out of 24) are being degraded or used unsustainably. Human activity has been responsible for most of the damage\u00a0\u2014 largely through the effects it has had on biodiversity and the integrity of ecological systems. These findings were at the heart of the policy discussions during the G8+5 Summit in May 2007, in Potsdam, Germany, where Heads of States asked for a comprehensive evaluation of the costs of biodiversity loss. Progress on this complex evaluation was first presented in May 2008 by the first TEEB report on 'The economics of ecosystems and biodiversity: An Interim Report'.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/putting-a-value-on-nature"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0534", "date": "2010-09-09", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Recession accelerates the decline in EU greenhouse gas emissions", "text": "The exceptionally deep recession of 2009 affected all economic sectors in the EU. Consumption of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) fell by 5.5 % in 2009 compared to the previous year. The strongest impact on greenhouse gas emissions came from the sharp 12.7 % drop in coal use. At the same time, renewable energy use (excluding biomass) increased significantly, rising by 8.3 %. In relative terms, the largest emission reductions occurred in industrial processes reflecting lower activity levels in the cement, chemical and iron and steel industries. The decreased demand for energy linked to the economic recession was accompanied by cheaper natural gas and increasedrenewable energy use, which together contributed to lower emissions. However, the relatively colder winter of 2009 increased the residential sector\u2019s heating needs, partly offsetting the total reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The 2009 verified emissions from the sectors covered by the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) decreased by 11.6\u00a0% compared to 2008. Sectors covered by the EU-ETS therefore achieved bigger emissions cuts than other sectors. Looking ahead, it's apparent that, following the EU's deep recession in 2009, economic recovery may result in higher emissions in 2010 compared to the preceding year or at least less rapid emissions cuts. Source: EEA and European Topic Centre \u2014 Air and Climate Change The EEA estimates for 2009 do not take into account the effects of carbon sinks and emission reductions achieved through the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s flexible mechanisms. They are based on the publicly available verified EU-ETS emissions for 2009 and other national and European sources, available as of mid-July 2010. Several European countries have published their own estimates for 2009 emissions, which were also used to improve the EEA estimates for the EU-15 and the EU-27. What next? The 2009 estimates will be used to track progress towards EU targets in the annual EEA report on greenhouse gas emission trends and projections in Europe, due later this year.The verified EU-ETS emissions for 2010 will be published in April 2011, giving an early indication of the overall trend for the 2010 emissions.The official 2009 greenhouse gas emissions for the EU will be available in June 2011 in the 'EU Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990\u20132009 and Inventory Report 2011', compiled by the EEA and submitted to the UNFCCC by the European Commission. Background on EU emission reduction commitments Under the Kyoto Protocol, the EU-15 has a common commitment to reduce emissions on average by 8 % between 2008 and 2012 compared to emissions in the 'base year'. The base-year emissions for the EU-15 have been fixed to 4 265.5 million tonnes CO2\u2011equivalent. Unlike the EU-15, the EU-27 does not have a common target under the Kyoto Protocol and therefore the EU-27 does not have an applicable base year against which to compare emission changes. Emission changes compared to 1990 are applicable to the EU-27 as it has made a unilateral commitment to achieve at least a 20 % reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990.

Whatever the causes, coastal regions today host almost half of the inhabitants of EU countries with a sea border. They host homes and workplaces, industries, holiday destinations and recreation areas. With an immense variety of habitats, ranging from salt-adapted scrubs and grasslands, cliffs and rocky shores, sandy beaches and tidal areas, estuaries and lagoons, they are also home to numerous species, many a key source of food and economic prosperity for Europe. Ninth in the series of '10 messages for 2010', the EEA\u2019s new assessment on coastal ecosystems presents key findings on the state of biodiversity in coastal zones and explores the main causes of coastal ecosystem degradation. As transition zones between land and marine environments, coastal zones are affected by changes and pressures from both sides. Truly sustainable coastal management can only be achieved using an integrated and ecosystem approach, with coordinated action at global, regional and local levels, taking into account the pressures and socio-economic realities both on land and at sea. Key findings The main causes of changes to coastal ecosystems are coastal erosion; sprawling economic sites and infrastructure linked to urbanisation and tourism; and creating and managing forests as well as water bodies. Coastal erosion is largely caused by sediment starvation as a consequence of river dams, although intensive development and sand mining can also contribute to coastal habitat destruction. Half of Europe\u2019s coastal wetlands are expected to disappear (approximately 4500\u00a0km2) as a result of sea level rise linked to climate change. About 10 % of Europe\u2019s coastline is already protected by sea defences. Climate change is also expected to affect river flows and species in coastal wetlands and estuaries. Higher water temperatures might also shift the balance in favour of invasive alien species. Urbanisation put Mediterranean coastal wetlands under constant pressure in the period 1990\u20132000, particularly in Spain and southern Italy.High nitrate and phosphate loads in water environments lead to blue-green algae blooms, which can choke all other aquatic life through high oxygen consumption and threaten human health in bathing areas.Increasing exploitation of sand and gravel from coastal zones or over-exploitation of fish stocks also put considerable pressure on coastal ecosystems.More than two thirds of coastal habitat types and more than half of species typical of coastal ecosystems have an \u2018unfavourable\u2019 conversation status. \u00a0Policy frameworks in place In 2002, the European Commission recommended implementing \u2018Integrated Coastal Zone Management\u2019 acknowledging the uniqueness of coastal zones. The EU Water Framework Directive, adopted in 2000, requires surface water bodies (lakes, streams, rivers, estuaries and coastal waters) to be ecologically sound by 2015. The EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, adopted in 2008, urges the creation of a network of marine protected areas by 2012 and stipulates that marine ecosystems must reach a good environmental status by 2020. Coastal habitats and species are also covered by the European Union\u2019s two key nature conservation directives: the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive. Several international conventions, including the OSPAR Convention (Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic), Barcelona Convention (Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution), and Bucharest Convention (Convention for the Protection of the Black Sea against Pollution) also enhance regional cooperation. More policy-specific responses, such as the ongoing reform of the EU\u2019s Common Fisheries Policy, should also have a strong positive impact on coastal economies.

Increasingly, however, they are threatened by land abandonment, intensification of agriculture, infrastructure development, unsustainable exploitation and climate change. Eighth in the series of '10 messages for 2010', the EEA's new assessment on mountain ecosystems indicates that managing mountains sustainably relies on effective policies and actions at regional and local levels. Mountain ecosystems cover 36 % of the continent (29 % of the European Union). Around 40 % of this area is forested. Compared with lowlands, the variation in altitudes, temperatures and precipitation have resulted in a richer variety of plant and animal species in mountains. Key pressures and policies Intensified agriculture and land abandonment: in lower altitudes, non-intensive traditional farming has created and maintains semi-natural habitats, supporting a wide range of grassland species. More than half of Europe's High Nature Value farmland, typically associated with low-intensity agriculture and grazing, is found in mountain areas. Any change to agricultural intensity threatens such habitats and species. Land abandonment occurs across the EU and threatens ecosystems such as grasslands, which are highly dependent on human management.Climate change: average temperatures increased by approximately 2 degrees in the Alps between the late 19th century and early 21st centuries. This is twice the average rate in the Northern hemisphere and has caused a significant decrease in glacier volume. Higher temperatures also mean less snow and more rain in the winter, resulting in more runoff in winter and less in spring and summer. Where they are able to move uphill or northwards, flora and fauna can retain the bioclimatic conditions to which they are adapted. For mountain plant species, however, migration is obviously more difficult and more than half could face extinction by 2100.Infrastructure development: construction of highways and motorways increases the fragmentation in mountain areas, isolating and limiting the movement of many species. In certain locations, the development of skiing infrastructure can make soil more vulnerable to water erosion.Unsustainable exploitation: Fuel wood harvesting and timber trade in the Caucasus mountains irreversibly reduce both biodiversity and the goods and services on which local people depend. Hunting and poaching of rare and endangered species in the Carpathians have reduced populations, threatening their long-term viability. Mass tourism often favours the introduction of invasive alien species.Policy frameworks: international and regional agreements and processes, including the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Alpine Convention, indicate that there is adequate recognition at the European level of the need for international cooperation.

SOx is an important air pollutant that acidifies ecosystems and forms harmful fine particulate matter in the atmosphere. Since the early 1990s a combination of measures has helped reduce emissions, including introducing low sulphur fuels and fitting pollution control equipment in European industrial facilities. Lower emissions from public power plants in Bulgaria, Poland and Spain contributed to the 20 % annual emission reduction in 2008. Spain, for example,\u00a0reduced its SOx emissions by using less coal to generate electricity and instead relying on natural gas and renewables such as wind, photovoltaics and biomass. CO, NMVOCs and NOx are main contributors to the formation of ground-level ozone, a harmful pollutant that can trigger respiratory problems, contribute to premature mortality and also damage plants, reducing agricultural crop yields. EU-27 emissions of these ozone precursors fell in 2008 in a number of Member States, including France, Spain and UK, particularly from public power plants. Emissions from road transport also fell significantly in these Member States, partly reflecting reduced freight transport on roads in the second half of 2008 due to economic recession.\u00a0 Other key findings In 2008 EU-27 emissions of fine particulate matter fell by 13\u00a0% (PM2.5) and 8\u00a0% (PM10) compared to 2000. Emission trends have not improved much in the last five years, with emissions actually increasing slightly (by 0.2 %) in 2008 compared to the previous year.NOx emissions from road transport have decreased by 40\u00a0% since 1990, mainly due to the introduction of three\u2011way catalytic converters in passenger cars and stricter regulation of emissions from heavy goods vehicles across Europe. Road transport nevertheless remains the most important source of the ozone precursors NOx and CO, contributing 41 % and 34 % of EU-27 emissions in 2008.In contrast to the road transport sector, NOx emissions from aviation have increased significantly. Since 1990, the share of total EU-27 emissions that derive from domestic and international flights has trebled to more than 5 %.For the first time, the annual EU inventory report also presents information on emissions of toxic heavy metals. EU-27 emissions of mercury, cadmium and lead have dropped by 60\u00a0% or more since 1990, reflecting improved control of emissions from sources such as electricity production, industry and road transport. However, the rate of decrease in total emissions of these three toxic heavy metals has slowed over the last five years. \u00a0 EU-27 emission trends for the main air pollutants, particulate matter and heavy metals (European Union air pollutant emission inventory report, p.7) \u00a0 What is the LRTAP Convention? The Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) addresses some of the major environmental problems caused by air pollution in the member countries of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). The Convention has 51 Parties and aims to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution including long-range transboundary air pollution. The EEA assists the EU by preparing the inventory to be reported under the LRTAP Convention each year.

Seventh in the series of '10 messages for 2010', the EEA's new assessment on agricultural ecosystems recommends that policy promote creating and maintaining more diverse agricultural landscapes. After all, healthy agro-ecosystems are a necessity for high and sustained productivity. Until the latest reforms, the CAP's primary focus was on the quantity of food produced. This accelerated the spread of intensive farming practices in more productive land and the abandonment of the less productive areas. Both of these trends have adversely affected biodiversity and have not yet been reversed despite the introduction of agri-environment measures. Although intensively farmed land supports a certain level of biodiversity, it generally lacks significant areas of 'High Nature Value', which are essential for preserving biodiversity. Europe's more traditional, low-intensity farming systems with high nature value are gradually disappearing. Even when abandoned, agricultural land is often replaced by less diverse vegetation or forest. Key trends and policy suggestions Biodiversity underpins processes and ecosystem services essential for agriculture, such as soil formation, pest control, maintaining soil fertility and regulating the water cycle.Pressures on soil biodiversity are increasing. Soil erosion is exacerbated by human activities such as overexploitation of agricultural land. From 1980 to the mid-1990s, common farmland bird populations fell by almost 50\u00a0%. Since then their populations seem to have levelled off. Grassland butterfly populations have decreased by 60 % since 1990 and the decline is continuing.Mechanisation, drainage and introduction of irrigation crops have simplified the agricultural landscape and cleared small woodlands, ponds and hedges to allow heavy machinery to move. Re-introducing such buffering elements into intensely farmed systems would create a more diverse landscape, providing a mosaic of habitats and thereby boosting biodiversity.Intensive farming has also favoured genetically uniform crops and livestock breeds vulnerable to pests and diseases. Long and diverse crop rotations, diverse regional distribution of crops and selecting crops better matched to the natural fertility of the soil could all contribute to fostering biodiversity, while maintaining a high level of productivity.The upcoming CAP reform offers a good opportunity to address existing shortcomings and integrate biodiversity issues more effectively.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/how-europe2019s-agriculture-can-boost-biodiversity"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0539", "date": "2010-06-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Take a look at your water environment", "text": "Excessive levels of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in water bodies can cause algal blooms and an associated loss in aquatic life.

Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA Environment Commissioner Janez Poto\u010dnik said, 'Over the last thirty years, EU and national legislation has significantly improved the quality of Europe's bathing waters but our work does not end here. Despite our decade-long track record of high quality, we need to keep up the effort constantly to both improve and maintain what we have achieved.'

Efforts to improve the quality of bathing waters should be seen in the context of Europe's efforts to achieve good ecological and environmental status in accordance with the EU Water and Marine Framework Directives. 2009 results confirm a long-term upward trend Of the 20 000 bathing areas monitored throughout the European Union in 2009, two\u2011thirds were on the coast and the rest were at rivers and lakes. Compliance with mandatory values (minimum quality requirements) at coastal sites increased from 80 % in 1990 to 96 % in 2009. For inland waters, the increase was even greater, rising from 52 % to 90 %. Between 2008 and 2009 there was a slight deterioration in the number of bathing waters meeting minimum standards, with reductions of less than 1 percentage point (pp) for coastal sites and 3 pps for inland bathing waters. Compliance with the more stringent 'guide values' between 2008 and 2009 increased by slightly less than 1 pp for coastal sites to reach 89 % but decreased by less than 3 pps for inland waters to 71 %. Such annual fluctuations are not unusual by the standards of recent years. Almost all the coastal bathing sites in Cyprus, France, Greece and Portugal complied with the more stringent guide values [1]. Only 2 % of EU coastal bathing sites were banned in 2009, mostly in Italy. Although inland bathing sites show greater variation in water quality, a large majority of the inland sites in Finland, France, Germany and Sweden also complied with guide values. Fourteen Member States monitoring under the new Bathing Water Directive To determine their quality, bathing waters are tested against a number of physical, chemical and microbiological parameters. Member States must comply with the mandatory values set out in the Bathing Water Directive [2] but may choose instead to adhere to the stricter (non-binding) guide values. In 2006 a new Bathing Water Directive [3] took effect, which updated the parameters and monitoring provisions in line with the latest scientific knowledge. The new Directive places greater emphasis on providing information to the public on the quality of bathing areas. Member States have until 2015 to implement the new Directive fully but fourteen Member States (Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden) already monitored their bathing areas during the 2009 bathing season according to the new Directive\u2019s requirements .

Our policies and tools seem to be working' said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. 'Although we are expecting an even sharper decline in 2009, caused mainly by the recession, we need to ensure that the downward trend in emissions continues and that Europe boosts its climate investments, with the ultimate aim of achieving a more resource-efficient economy.' The combination of high coal and carbon prices accompanied by a drop in natural gas prices in 2008 induced heat and electricity producers to replace more polluting coal by gas and as a result, reduce their GHG emissions. The use of biomass and other renewable sources (wind and hydroelectric power) has also increased significantly in 2008. The economic recession, which started during the second half of the year, also contributed to emission reductions from several sectors including the manufacturing and construction, and road transport sectors. Road transport emissions were also affected by high oil prices, the continued decline in gasoline consumption and a reversal of the upward trend in diesel sales. The annual reductions for EU-15 and EU-27 revealed in the inventory report fall within the brackets of the 2008 preliminary estimates, published by the Agency\u00a0 in August 2009. Key findings The EU-27's emissions have been declining steadily since 2003 to reach 4 940 billion tonnes CO2 equivalents in 2008. Compared to the 2007 emissions, this represents a reduction of 99 million tonnes or 2 %. With the 2008 emissions 11.3 % below its 1990 levels, EU-27 has already achieved more than half of its unilateral reduction target of 20 % by 2020 through domestic emission reductions alone.In this first year of the Kyoto Protocol's commitment period, EU-15 cut its emissions by 76 million tonnes CO2 equivalents, corresponding to a drop of 1.9 % from 2007. This brought the EU-15 emissions 6.9 %, or 295 million tonnes, below Kyoto base-year levels, already in 2008, not accounting for carbon sinks and the use of Kyoto flexible mechanisms.For the first time since 1992, emissions from international aviation and maritime transport fell in EU-27, partly due to the economic recession. These two sectors account for about 5.9 % of total greenhouse gas emissions in EU-27 but are not accounted for in relation to measuring progress towards Kyoto targets.Spain accounted for one third of the net reduction in EU-27, mainly due to a substantial replacement of coal by natural gas and a sharp decline in gasoline consumption in road transport, complemented by an increase in renewable energy generation.The EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) covered 43 % of total EU-27 greenhouse gas emissions in 2008. In 2008, emission levels under the EU ETS were about 3 % lower than 2007 levels. The recently published 2009 EU ETS data, reveal that verified emissions in 2009 decreased by 11.6 % compared to 2008 levels, and reflects the impact of the economic recession.\u00a0 What next? At the end of the summer 2010, the Agency will publish preliminary estimates for the 2009 total EU emissions. This will be followed in the autumn by more comprehensive reports analysing emission trends, policy effectiveness and progress towards meeting the Kyoto and other EU emission targets.

The baseline is intended to solve these problems and provide policymakers with a starting point for measuring the state of biodiversity inside the EU and unveiling major information gaps. It provides a framework for articulating linkages between species numbers, habitats status and ecosystem services, and uses facts and figures that are scientifically robust and have been validated and/or peer reviewed in the Member States. Information on species and habitats will be organised into main ecosystem types (coastal, wetlands, grasslands, forests and so forth). After 2010, these data, which will be regularly updated,\u00a0will provide a clear historical record of progress. Most importantly, the baseline will also provide information on ecosystem services. The baseline outlined today will be fully developed before the end of the year and will support the development of biodiversity sub-targets to be set by the forthcoming revised EU Biodiversity Policy. BISE: a unique platform for biodiversity information BISE is the European information portal designed to facilitate access to existing information about nature and biodiversity, presenting existing data in a far more comprehensive manner than before. As well as information about EU policy and legislation in the area of nature, there is a wealth of material about the state of the EU environment and ecosystems and the threats they face, information about research in biodiversity that is going on around the EU, and access to information about the state of biodiversity reporting in Member States, designed to encourage greater cooperation. What's more? The serious and continuing loss to Europe's biodiversity is a reflection of the ongoing decline in ecosystems, natural capacity and their ability to perform regulating functions. The EEA has recently released a technical report \u2018Ecosystem accounting and the cost of biodiversity losses \u2014 the case of coastal Mediterranean wetlands\u2019, which explains how we can use land and ecosystem accounting techniques to describe and monitor the consequences of biodiversity loss. The EEA published today a new technical report 'Towards an early warning and information system for invasive alien species (IAS) threatening biodiversity in Europe'. Invasive alien species have over the last decades become a major driver of biodiversity loss, second only to habitat fragmentation. Europe is particularly affected by alien species, which are invading the continent at an unprecedented pace. The report is a contribution to the establishment of an \u2018Early Warning and Rapid Response System (EWRR)\u2019, which is a framework designed to respond to biological invasions through a coordinated system.

A species' survival depends not only on its own ability to adapt but often on that of its cohabitants. After all, the disappearance of one species or arrival of another in an ecosystem could mean less food or more predators. Unfortunately, human activity, mainly our consumption of natural resources, is causing an unprecedented decline in global biodiversity. Cities, as the home to many species, are ecosystems in their own right. They consume, transform and release material and energy. They develop, adapt and interact with other ecosystems. Unlike other ecosystems, however, cities are our primary habitat: three out of four Europeans live in urban areas. Many city dwellers associate green spaces with higher quality of life. But the importance of urban green spaces does not stop at recreation. They also filter large amounts of water after heavy rainfall and soften the effects of heat waves or other extreme events. The new EEA assessment on urban ecosystems \u2014 the sixth in a series of '10 messages for 2010' \u2014 reveals that with the right policies and tools, urbanisation does not need to be a threat to biodiversity in cities and beyond. Short of green space? Think vertically Vertical gardens are not a new concept but their function has evolved. The 'hanging gardens of Babylon' might have been designed to produce more food and please the eye but today's vertical gardens are also used to insulate buildings, absorb urban noise and reduce dust, thereby improving air quality. Vertical gardens enlarge the potential habitat for city dwelling animals. For non-urban species, they reduce the distances between 'natural areas', facilitating movement and increasing their chances of survival. To raise awareness about biodiversity in cities and the benefits it delivers, the EEA facade, overlooking one of the most prominent squares of Copenhagen, will be covered by 5 000 plants drawing a map of the European continent. 'Europe in bloom: a living fa\u00e7ade' illustrates the diversity of flowering plant species across Europe using 20 annual plant species of varying colours.

Many private motor vehicles in the region are old and highly polluting, which increases pollution problems. Urban areas have sprawled; so has construction for tourism along the coastlines. This is one of the main threats to the region\u2019s rich biodiversity. The generation of municipal waste has risen steadily in recent years. It is currently estimated to be at levels similar to those in the EU-12. Municipal waste management is weak in many parts of the region and many waste facilities are old. Abandoned landfills, accumulated industrial waste and mining waste, are also a serious problem in some areas. Agricultural land abandonment has biodiversity impacts. At the same time, agricultural production and fertiliser use are increasing; indicating that farming in the region has become more intensive.

Only 16 expect to achieve their respective NOx ceilings, with road transport bearing most of the blame. The road transport sector contributed around 40 % of total EU-27 NOx emissions in 2008 and although its overall emissions have decreased since 1990, the reduction has not always been as large as originally anticipated. This is partly because the sector has grown more than expected and partly because vehicle emission standards have not always delivered the foreseen level of NOx reductions. Several Member States, including Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom, expect to exceed their respective NOx ceilings by small margins (less than 5\u00a0%). In contrast, France and Spain expect to exceed their ceilings by 261\u00a0kilotonnes and 236\u00a0kilotonnes respectively \u2014 equivalent to surpluses of 32\u00a0% and 28\u00a0%.

WM projections take into account currently implemented and adopted policies and measures. Where Member States have instead reported only 'business as usual' (BAU) projections, it is assumed for comparison with the ceilings that these are equivalent to a WM projection. Not all Member States have fully incorporated the effects of the recession into their projections for 2010. For these countries, decreased economic activity may improve the chances of meeting their obligations. What does the NEC Directive cover? The EU NEC Directive sets pollutant-specific and legally binding emission ceilings (limits) for four main air pollutants: sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and ammonia (NH3). These pollutants harm both human health and the environment by contributing to the formation of ozone and particulate matter and leading to acidification and eutrophication. Member States must meet the NEC Directive\u2019s ceilings by 2010 in order to deliver the originally agreed health and environmental benefits. What next? The Thematic Strategy on Air (TSAP) adopted by the Commission in 2005 lists a revision of the NEC Directive as an important action to achieve the health and environmental targets of the TSAP by 2020. This revision is expected to propose stricter emission ceilings for 2020 in order to protect health and the environment further. It could also, for the first time, introduce a ceiling for fine particulate matter (PM2.5). In the absence of new legislation, however, the NEC Directive remains in force and requires that future emissions stay below national ceilings after 2010.

Volcanic aerosol, a suspension of fine solid particles or liquid droplets in the air, is created during eruptions and can be transported thousands of kilometres. Particles in the volcanic aerosol may carry pollutants with the potential to harm human health and ecosystems. So far, monitoring stations in Europe have only detected a few episodes of ambient air concentrations of particulate matter and sulphur dioxide of volcanic origin, in particular at elevated mountainous locations, for example at Zugspitze in Germany (2659 m). The threat to public health in the European Union is therefore considered minimal at present. On Iceland, however, the situation is different: concentrations of particulate matter are markedly higher than usual in some areas. That potentially represents a significant threat to humans and farm animals, according to the Icelandic Directorate of Health, which closely monitors pollution levels. In Europe, rain and snowfall are expected to remove volcanic debris from the atmosphere. Detecting this process requires the chemical content of precipitation to be analysed, which takes time. Should these data indicate high pollutant levels, the current assessment of risk for human health and ecosystems may need to be reassessed. The EEA maintains a public air quality information system, AirWatch, within its 'Eye on Earth' portal. It displays near real-time measurements of concentrations of three air pollutants (ground-level ozone, particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide) from approximately 1 000 monitoring stations in 32 countries, as well as updates from citizens. Because ambient air concentrations and fallout can vary across short ranges within Europe, the EEA also advises the public to refer to national or local air quality authorities, which may have additional or new information on local conditions.

Partly", "text": "On its tenth anniversary, the EEA's TERM report presents an overview of transport's impact on the environment, built on an analysis of 40 policy-relevant indicators. The report's findings for the period 1997\u20132007 present a mixed picture, with some improvements in air pollutants and serious concerns regarding persistent growth in transport\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. 'Over the last ten years we have concentrated on measures to improve mobility whilst decoupling transport emissions from economic growth. Today, we can see that the extensive investment in transport infrastructure has enabled us to travel further to meet our daily needs, but has not led to a decrease in the amount of time that we are exposed to noise, congestion and air pollution,' said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of EEA. 'In the future we will need to focus not only on the mode of transport, but also the reasons why people choose to travel, because ultimately mobility is inextricably linked to our quality of life.' Transport, including international aviation and maritime transport, accounts for around a quarter of total EU greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike some sectors, transport's impact on the environment continues to be closely linked to economic growth. Trends and findings Freight transport tends to grow slightly faster than the economy, with road and air freight recording the largest increases in the EU-27 (43 % and 35 %, respectively, between 1997 and 2007). The share of rail and inland waterways in the total freight volumes declined during that period.The current economic slowdown has reduced transport volumes but transport is expected to resume its growth as soon as the economy starts to grow again. Passenger transport continued to grow but at a slower rate than the economy. Air travel within the EU remained the fastest growth area, increasing 48 % between 1997 and 2007. Car journeys remained the dominant mode of transport, accounting for 72 % of all passenger kilometres in the EU-27.In EEA countries, greenhouse gas emissions from transport (excluding international aviation and maritime transport) grew by 28 % between 1990 and 2007, and now account for around 19 % of total emissions. Despite recent reductions in air pollutant emissions, road transport was the largest emitter of nitrogen oxides and the second largest contributor of pollutants forming particulate matter in 2007.Among 32 EEA countries, only Germany and Sweden are on track to meet their 2010 indicative targets for biofuels use.Road traffic remains by far the largest source of exposure to transport noise. The number of people exposed to damaging noise levels, especially at night, is expected to increase unless effective noise policies are developed and implemented in full.

Besides unsustainable management practices, air borne pollution and climate change, forests are also threatened by fragmentation due to rapidly spreading urban areas and transport networks. Both the healthy functioning of forest ecosystems and the biodiversity they foster are at risk. Forests protect soil from erosion, regulate water flows and capture carbon from the atmosphere. Around and within urban areas, they are essential for providing fresh air, reducing dust and noise. They also serve as microclimate buffers against urban heat. The wellbeing of numerous plants and animals, including many species protected by European Union legislation, is directly linked to forest ecosystems. Moreover, forest patches also play a critical\u00a0role in facilitating species' movements through their connectivity with other ecosystems. Main findings About one-third of the land area of EEA and collaborating countries is forest, with the largest wooded areas located in Finland, France, Spain and Sweden.Only 5 % of forests in EEA countries are undisturbed by human intervention. In the wider European region covered by 'Forest Europe', such forests account for almost a quarter of the total forest area, with more than half of the undisturbed forest located in the Russian Federation.Old growth natural and semi-natural forests are particularly valuable for biodiversity and carbon storage.More than half of the forest species of 'European interest' and over 60 % of forest habitat types identified by the Habitats Directive are reported to be in 'unfavourable conservation status'.Twenty-seven per cent of mammals, 10 % of reptiles and 8 % of amphibians linked to forest ecosystems are threatened with extinction in the EU region.Climate change is first expected to affect the range of tree species, with greatest impacts on those situated at latitudinal and altitudinal extremes. Increased periods of drought and warmer winters are likely to weaken forests further against invasive species.Although certain tree species may produce higher timber yields, genetic variety in regionally adapted forests is essential for adapting to new environmental conditions such as climate change.Factors such as forest ownership structures and the importance of forestry to national economies can significantly influence forest ecosystem management targets, thereby affecting biodiversity. Forty per cent of forests in EEA countries are state owned. The remaining 60 % is private property.

More traditional, low-intensity farming systems that support biodiversity, known as High Nature Value (HNV) farmland, continue to disappear. With an annual budget of roughly EUR 53 billion, the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is an important factor in shaping Europe's agriculture. Its future role and objectives are currently the subject of broad debate. The EEA technical report \"Distribution and targeting of the CAP budget from a biodiversity perspective\" stresses that EU spending could be better targeted to support HNV farmland, thereby boosting biodiversity. Despite recent reforms, most CAP payments still go to the most productive agricultural land and relatively little is spent to support HNV farms, which often have lower incomes. All policy incentives to conserve HNV farmland, including a possible redesign of the CAP, have to be seen in the wider socio-economic context of agriculture and should take the delivery of ecosystem goods and services into account. These include, for example, food provision, water regulation, carbon storage and landscape amenity value. Significant differences among Member States The five case studies included in the report (addressing the Czech Republic, Estonia, Extremadura in Spain, France and the Netherlands) suggest fundamental differences in CAP implementation in EU-15 and EU-12. In the three old Member States studied, single farm payments constitute over 85 % of total CAP expenditure and generally favour more intensive production systems. In the new Member States studied, single farm payments (in the period under study) amounted to just 60 % of the total and were distributed more evenly across different types of farmland. The two new Member States studied provide significant funding for biodiversity-rich grassland and other types of HNV farmland through rural development spending. Considerable farmland in some of the new Member States is not registered for CAP support payments. This mainly comprises small farms and marginal land where HNV farming is likely to dominate. Background on the report The report reviews whether CAP payments are likely to help maintain High Nature Value farmland. It follows up an earlier assessment, published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and EEA in 2004. \u00a0 Links EEA report on High Nature Value Farmland in 2004European Commission\u2019s post-2013 CAP debateStudy on public goods provided by agricultureJRC report on High Nature Value Farmland in Europe", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/better-targeted-agricultural-spending-could-enhance-biodiversity-protection"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0556", "date": "2010-03-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Summer ozone: record low concentrations in 2009", "text": "Eighteen EU Member States reported exceeding the information threshold (ozone concentrations over 180 \u00b5g/m3), with Belgium, Greece, Italy and Portugal recording the largest number of exceedances. As in most previous years, no station in northern Europe registered information threshold exceedances. Eight EU Member States (Bulgaria, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom) reported exceeding the alert threshold (ozone concentrations of 240 \u00b5g/m3). The record lows in 2009 came despite average summer temperatures close to those measured in the extremely hot summer of 2003, which witnessed the highest number of exceedances in the last decade. The differing results in the two summers may be attributable to several factors because ozone formation is determined by various meteorological conditions, as well as the chemical composition of the atmosphere. It seems likely, however, that reductions in anthropogenic ozone precursor gas emissions in Europe contributed significantly to the general decrease in peak ozone concentrations. For the first time since 1997, no concentration higher than 300 \u00b5g/m3 was reported. The highest one-hour ozone concentration (284 \u00b5g/m3) was observed in France. In contrast to previous summers, in 2009 there were no widespread multi-day episodes. Summer 2009 was characterised by ozone episodes of between two and five days followed by spells with few exceedances. Whereas ozone forms a protective layer in the stratosphere, at ground level it is a harmful air pollutant that affects human health. Sources of ozone precursor emissions include power plants, cars and trucks, and certain paints and solvents. In the summer, ozone concentrations are worsened by relatively light winds and higher temperatures.

Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA Eye On Earth was launched in May 2008 with WaterWatch, an application presenting water-quality data on an interactive site powered by Bing Maps. With this new update, Eye On Earth gets not just a fresh look and feel for both air and bathing water information, it also becomes one of the newest applications built on Windows Azure and SQL Azure hosting the Geo Observatory Data Store. The site's user interface provides interactive information from Europe-wide to street level, based on data from air-quality measurement stations and citizens' input. It translates scientific data into easily understandable terms. In addition to near real-time data on specific air pollutants available from air-quality measurement stations, AirWatch presents air-quality information based on Europe-wide modelling covering larger areas. This allows users to get an indication of the air quality anywhere in Europe and not only in the proximity of measurement stations. Users will also see how other viewers described the air in a particular area. \"Our environment is changing.

Our partnership with the EEA is a powerful example of different organisations \u2014 public and private sector \u2014 combining their separate areas of expertise towards a shared challenge.\" By linking locally relevant information from near real-time public observations to scientific measurements, the AirWatch and WaterWatch applications create an important new channel for policy-makers and citizens across Europe to communicate environmental data. This feedback loop, facilitated through the smart application of Microsoft technology, provides a vital connection point between Europe's people and the environment. It signals a new era in user-centric environmental innovation. Eye On Earth also includes features developed by Microsoft Services in concert with partners such as mBlox Inc. The EEA works with mBlox as its short message service (SMS) transaction partner for the Eye On Earth portal, leveraging its mobile transaction network that can instantly send a message to more than 3 billion people across nearly 200 countries. \"SMS is an ideal component of the Eye On Earth service, as it is environmentally friendly and the ubiquity of SMS means that the service is accessible to everyone through mobile phones and the internet, irrespective of international borders,\" said Andrew Dark, CEO of mBlox. \"It's good to see continued innovation and a commitment to interoperability through cross-browser support from the EEA,\" said James Governor, RedMonk industry analyst. \"SMS support dramatically lowers barriers to access for environmental quality information for 500 million citizens.\" In coming weeks, Eye On Earth will be made available in 24 additional European languages. Moreover, the portal will continue to be enriched with other environmental information from across Europe, covering themes such as biodiversity and noise.

Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director Whereas the Protocol requires that the EU-15 reduce average emissions during 2008\u20132012 to 8 % below 1990 levels, the latest projections indicate that the EU-15 will go further, reaching a total reduction of more than 13\u00a0% below the base year. Commenting on the findings, EEA Executive Director Professor Jacqueline McGlade said: \"It is encouraging that Europe's climate-changing emissions are expected to continue decreasing, outperforming the objectives set by the Kyoto Protocol. Such an accomplishment should encourage all countries to agree on much larger reductions of global emissions, sealing a global deal in Copenhagen this December. Commitments to deep emission cuts are urgently needed to preserve our chances to keep planetary temperature increases below 2\u00baC.\" The EEA report shows that the reductions in the period 2008\u20132012 will be achieved through a combination of existing and additional policies, the purchase by governments of credits from emission-reducing projects outside the EU, the trading of emission allowances by participants in the EU emission trading scheme (EU ETS) and forestry activities that absorb carbon from the atmosphere. The trading scheme primarily covers large carbon-emitting industries, which represent about 40\u00a0% of EU greenhouse gas emissions. Looking further ahead, almost three quarters of the EU's unilateral target to cut emissions to 20 % below 1990 levels by 2020 could be achieved domestically (i.e. without purchase of credits outside the EU). The report highlights the importance of the EU ETS in helping Member States meet their targets. It also stresses, however, that governments need to focus on reducing emissions in the sectors not covered by the ETS, such as transport, agriculture and households. How could the EU achieve the projected reductions? The report foresees a variety of factors contributing to the EU-15's total reduction of more than 13 %: Existing policies and measures for the period 2008\u20132012 could account for 6.9 percentage points of the total reduction. If Member States implement additional measures as planned, the total reduction could reach 8.5 %, although this will largely depend on combined efforts in four main emitting countries (France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom).The use of Kyoto's flexible mechanisms by governments could contribute an additional 2.2 percentage points reduction.Absorbing carbon dioxide through enhanced carbon sinks (e.g.improved forest management) will contribute with an additional 1\u00a0percentage point reduction.Purchase of emission allowances and credits by EU ETS operators is expected to deliver a further 1.4\u00a0percentage point reduction. Emission reductions may be furthered by economic recession Five EU-15 Member States (France, Germany, Greece, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have already reduced domestic emissions below their targets. Only Austria expects to fall short of its commitment under current conditions and will have to intensify its efforts to reduce emissions in non-ETS sectors. All other Member States and EEA member countries with emissions targets under the Kyoto Protocol anticipate that they will meet their commitments. Member States' projections have started to take into account the recent economic downturn but the report finds that GHG emissions may still be overestimated in the short term. As such, the recession could bring about further cuts in emissions. \u00a0Projected gap between EU-15 GHG emissions and Kyoto units (emission rights) during the Kyoto commitment period 2008\u20132012 (click for larger image) Note: EU-15 figure in absolute terms (\u2013\u00a0217 Mt CO2-eq.) not represented due to significantly higher scale.Countries are ranked by increasing absolute gap between their 2008\u20132012 projected emissions in the sectors not covered by the EU\u00a0ETS and their corresponding Kyoto target.

Within this overall target, each EU-15 member state has a differentiated reduction target; some should reduce emissions while others are allowed a limited increase. New Member States have individual targets except Cyprus and Malta, which have no targets. Countries can achieve these targets by various means.Base-year emissions: Under the Kyoto Protocol the GHG emission level in the 'base year' is the relevant starting point for tracking progress of domestic emissions for EU-15 and all Member States which have a Kyoto target. The EU-27 does not have a Kyoto target and an aggregated base year for the EU-27 is therefore not applicable in any discussion of progress towards Kyoto targets. It is important to clarify that the base year is not a 'year' per se, but the emission level from which emission reductions will take place. For carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, 1990 is used as the 'base year' for all EU-15 Member States. But for fluorinated gases, the EU-15 Member States can choose to use the emission levels in 1995 instead. Twelve of the 15 Member States have chosen to use 1995 as their base year for fluorinated gas emissions. In practice, EU-15 base-year emissions can be considered close to 1990 emissions.EU Emissions Trading Scheme: The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is the European Union's main climate change policy tool, which helps industries to cut their CO2 emissions in a cost-effective way. It requires a cap on emissions for all large CO2 emission sources.Domestic policies and measures: Domestic policies and measures take place within the national boundaries of the country (the promotion of electricity from renewable energy; improvements in energy efficiency; promotion of biofuels in transport; reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from cars; recovery of gases from landfills and reduction of fluorinated gases).Kyoto mechanisms: The Kyoto Protocol envisages market-based mechanisms that allow industrialised countries to meet their targets by benefiting from emission reductions in other countries. Under these mechanisms, Member States can trade emissions between themselves or acquire credits from emission-cutting projects they finance abroad. These mechanisms also help the transfer of low-carbon technologies to other countries and promote sustainable development.

With this new register, we take an important step in placing more environmental information at their fingertips. Anyone can now see how much pollution is being released to air and water from facilities in their neighbourhood or region. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said: \"Transparency is a vital tool for improving our environment. I welcome the opening of this register. It demonstrates a genuine commitment by the public authorities and industry to share information with citizens and increase openness. I thank them for their cooperation.\" Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency, said: \"To achieve the public participation objective set by the Aarhus Convention, people first need to know what is happening to their environment and what is at stake. With this new register, we take an important step in placing more environmental information at their fingertips. Anyone can now see how much pollution is being released to air and water from facilities in their neighbourhood or region.\" What does the register cover? In order to improve public access to environmental information, a new E-PRTR register has been set up, containing data reported by individual facilities. It provides details for 2007 of pollutants released from specific facilities to air, water and land. Its scope covers for instance 30 % of total NOx (nitrogen oxides) emissions (i.e. most emissions from sources other than transport), and 76 % of total SOx (sulphur oxides) emissions to air in the EU-27 countries and Norway. The register also shows the amount of waste and waste water transferred to other locations, including transboundary transfers of hazardous waste, and gives preliminary information on pollutants from 'diffuse' sources released to water, such as nitrogen and phosphorus loss from agriculture. The website has a powerful search engine that allows visitors to search using one or more criteria and a map tool. For example, visitors can search the amount of hazardous and non-hazardous waste transferred from facilities in a country (waste search), or releases from a specific industrial site by name or location (facility\u00a0 search). What kind of information can be obtained? E-PRTR reveals, for example, that: Often a small number of facilities make large overall contributions to the total amount of pollutants released in Europe. For instance, just five large combustion plants were collectively responsible for more than 20 % of all E-PRTR sulphur oxide emissions to air in 2007. Sulphur oxides contribute to both environmental acidification and the formation of health-damaging particulate matter. More than 54 million tonnes of hazardous waste were transferred from E-PRTR facilities. Most hazardous waste is recovered or disposed of within the country where it originates; just a small fraction of it (approximately 6 %) is transported across borders. Background The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (the 'Aarhus Convention') grants the public rights to access environmental information. In 2003, parties to the Aarhus Convention adopted the Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTR), which entered into force on 8 October 2009. The European Community is a signatory to the Protocol and has passed a Regulation (EC No 166/2006) to implement it. The Regulation defines minimum levels of activity and pollution above which information must be reported. It also goes beyond the PRTR Protocol by requiring Member States to report information on an additional five pollutants and imposing more stringent reporting thresholds for another six. From 2010 onwards, the information in E-PRTR will be updated in April each year. In addition to the 27 Member States of the European Union, it also includes data from Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The website, including the information on diffuse source releases, will gradually be improved in coming months. The former European pollutant register EPER covered 50 pollutants released to air and water from 56 industrial activities in 12 000 facilities in 26 countries (EU-25 and Norway). EPER required countries to report only every third year and included information from just two reporting years \u2014 2001 and 2004.

The NOISE (Noise Observation and Information Service for Europe) database provides, at the click of a mouse, a picture of the numbers of people exposed to noise generated by air, rail and road traffic across Europe and in 102 large urban agglomerations. Noise is ubiquitous but its role as a key form of pollution with serious human health consequences is still underestimated. Prolonged exposure to even low levels of noise can trigger hypertension and disrupt sleep. A first glance at Europe's noise exposure map is far from soothing: it is estimated than half of the population in urban areas with more than 250 000 inhabitants endure levels above 55 dB Lden (the lower EU benchmark for an average 24-hour period) as a result of ambient road noise. Just over 41 million Europeans are exposed to excessive noise from road traffic alone in the largest cities. Member States need to step up efforts in noise reporting Compiling information from 19 of the 32 EEA member countries, the NOISE database represents a major step towards a comprehensive pan-European service. Following the adoption of the Environmental Noise Directive (END), Member States were given until December 2007 to deliver relevant data. Users of the NOISE database can view the extent of data reported in accordance with the directive on a colour-coded map. Adopted in 2002, the END aims to moderate noise exposure in built-up areas. The Directive also covers noise in public parks or other quiet areas in an agglomeration, in quiet areas in open country, and near schools, hospitals and other noise-sensitive buildings and areas. It does not apply to noise caused by residents or noise from domestic activities, noise at work places or inside means of transport. About the noise indicators Lden is an indicator of the overall noise level during the day, evening and night, which is used to convey the annoyance caused by noise exposure. Lnight is an indicator for the sound level during the night used to describe sleep disturbance. They are both used for mapping noise in Europe.

The EEA will be cooperating with several partners, including EU institutions and the City of Copenhagen until the end of the international climate conference COP15. The EEA calendar of events offers an overview of all the activities where the Agency is involved. Background As host to the United Nations climate conference COP15 in December 2009, Copenhagen will be at the centre of a crucial discussion about the future of our planet. At the moment, the European Union is committed to reduce its emissions by 20 % in 2020, compared to 1990 levels. In the case of a solid international agreement in Copenhagen, however, the EU is ready to take on a more ambitious target of 30 %. In addition to assisting other EU institutions in their preparations for COP15, the Copenhagen-based European Environment Agency will also inform the general public on key climate issues. Besides regular assessments of Europe's greenhouse gas emissions, the EEA has developed strong expertise on the impacts of and the vulnerability to climate change in Europe.

The NEC Directive status report from the European Environment Agency presents information from the latest reporting round for both Member States and the EU as a whole for the four pollutants covered by the directive: sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and ammonia (NH3). These pollutants harm both human health and the environment by contributing to formation of ozone and particulate matter and leading to acidification and eutrophication. Only Spain anticipates missing three emission ceilings \u2014 those for NOx, NMVOC and NH3. Additional forecasts published separately by Spain in July, and which take into account the economic slowdown, confirm further that even if additional actions were implemented to reduce emissions of these pollutants, the ceilings would still be missed. Three Member States (France, Germany and the Netherlands) each anticipate missing two of their four emission ceilings. Of the four ceilings, NOx remains by far the most difficult for many Member States to achieve \u2014 12 Member States (see following table) now estimate they will miss the ceiling for this pollutant. Similar to last year's situation, some Member States including the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany expect to emit only slightly more NOx than their ceilings. Others, such as Ireland, Austria and Belgium, are projected to miss their limits by as much as up to 60 %. Several Member States plan to implement additional measures to reduce emissions which would reduce the number projected to exceed their ceilings. Still, five Member States (Austria, Belgium, France, Ireland and Spain) would still under these circumstances miss their ceilings by significant amounts. The progress toward meeting ceilings for the other pollutants remains largely on track.\u00a0 Effects of the economic recession not yet known The latest data available only covers past emissions up until 2007 and few Member States have yet fully incorporated the effects of the recession into their projections for 2010. However, based on informal information received from countries, it seems certain that for certain pollutants and sectors, emissions for 2008 will be lower than for previous years \u2014 as a result of the recession. Decreased economic activity might also improve the chances of those Member States close to the level of the ceilings, in meeting their 2010 ceilings. Member States must ensure that future emissions stay within their national ceilings after economic recovery as the NEC Directive limits also apply beyond 2010. Achieving the emission limits for the European Community NOx emissions for the EU-27 as a whole are now projected to be 6 % above the aggregated Member State ceilings (known as the Annex I ceiling) and 16 % above the stricter ceiling for the European Community as a whole (the Annex II ceiling) set for 2010. For the other three pollutants (SO2, NMVOCs, NH3) the situation is better, reflecting that most EU Member States are expected to reduce their emissions beyond the level of their ceilings. Only for SO2 and NH3 is the EU-27 expected to register substantial reductions, meeting both the aggregated ceilings.

In its 2010 NMVOC projection, Poland has included emissions from natural sources. Discounting these emissions, Poland anticipates meeting its 2010 ceiling. Background information The NEC Directive requires Member States to report annually information concerning emissions and projections for four air pollutants: SO2, NOx, NMVOC and NH3. These pollutants contribute to the formation of particulate matter and ground-level ozone, which are harmful to human health as well as to ecosystems and vegetation. The pollutants can also be deposited in soils and waters, causing damage to ecosystems by acidification and eutrophication. A proposal from the European Commission \u2014 not yet published \u2014 is expected to include stricter emission ceilings for 2020, and for the first time, national limits on the emissions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The current EEA report is based on the 2008 annual reporting cycle, for which Member States provided final emissions data for the year 2006 and preliminary data for 2007, as well as projected emissions data for 2010. By the end of 2009, the Member States are again required to submit updated 2010 estimates, together with final 2007 and preliminary 2008 emissions data. The report now also provides emissions expressed on a per capita and per GDP basis. The data in this report is also available through the EEA's NEC Directive dataviewer. New country-specific profiles presenting key information and parameters for each Member State are available here. Annex I of the NEC Directive defines both country-based ceilings and aggregated emission ceilings for the EU-27 (which are the sums of the individual Member State ceilings in that Annex). Annex II also defines SO2, NOx and NMVOC ceilings for the EU-27 as a whole. These ceilings are stricter than those in Annex I and are designed with the aim of attaining by 2010 the interim environmental objectives set out in the directive (i.e. reduction of acidification, health- and vegetation-related ground-level ozone exposure by 2010 compared with the 1990 situation).

The Agency and EWP will further cooperate on the implementation of the vision for water in a sustainable Europe, launched in June 2008. As a part of its next \"European Environment State and Outlook Report\" (SOER) due to be released in late 2010, the EEA will present the priorities and problems in implementing the water vision, as well as the joint efforts environmental and non-environmental stakeholders are taking towards the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, EU's main legislation on water quality. The second component of the cooperation will consist of\u00a0 awareness-raising - not only of the public, but also of key actors - to ensure the implementation of the vision as well as the directive. In addition to such initiatives as Eye on Earth \u2013 Water Watch to communicate water quality to the public, the EEA has also developed indicators and benchmarking on water use intended for key actors. The cooperation with EWP will promote such methods to wider audiences while encouraging both businesses and users to adopt them for greater transparency. The final component will consist of improving water information management \u00a0in Europe. Currently, nearly all relevant information on policy implementation is brought together in Water Information System for Europe (WISE), a joint development of the EEA, the European Commission and Member States.

Hosting most of the headwaters of the rivers Danube, Rhine, Po and Rhone, the Alps are also exposed to increasing demand for water to satisfy the needs of agriculture and the tourism sector. The EEA report calls on public and private actors at the regional and local levels to better coordinate water and land use and to share water resources more efficiently across sectors. Success factors for implementing adaptation include technological measures (such as improved irrigation techniques or wastewater and greywater re-use), initiatives to manage water demand (such as awareness raising and reducing water use by households) and ensuring full participation and empowerment of regional and local actors. To supplement the broad projections of more frequent droughts in summer, floods and landslides in winter and higher inter-annual variability of precipitation, the report presents six case studies that illustrate experiences of regional adaptation to key water resource issues related to climate change in Austria, France, Italy, Slovenia and Switzerland.

In addition to specific analyses and recommendations linked to the three case studies, the report includes overall recommendations for more effective management of cohesion spending. Most effective cohesion spending occurs when clear environmental policies and strategies are developed outside the Structural Fund programming and then fully integrated into the programmes. Some regions have encountered difficulties in spending all the resources allocated to them, in particular for innovative environmental projects such as those linking biodiversity protection and rural development. Fewer problems were seen for 'traditional' projects, such as wastewater treatment plants. To address such issues, EU-wide initiatives could be established to promote 'best spending' practices. The report recommends that the funds be used to promote new and more sustainable mobility patterns, as well as minimising the negative impacts of transport and infrastructure projects supported. Moreover, guidelines on green public procurement should be developed to ensure that cohesion spending helps achieve the objectives of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy. Current and future challenges related to adaptation and vulnerability to climate change will also need additional attention. Here, the report highlights a shift in spending priorities. Policy goals for climate change, for example, were given a much higher priority in the spending cycle for 2007\u20132013 than previously. But the report also notes that the link between spending and results has not always been easy to evaluate: for some regions, the right data were not available.

The 2008 emission reductions reflect the effects of the global economic recession which began in 2008, which resulted in reduced industrial output and reduced energy consumption by industry, and correspondingly reduced freight transport. The reductions are also apparent in the verified emissions from EU ETS (Emission Trading Scheme) for 2008, where total EU-27 emissions decreased by 3.9 % between 2007 and 2008. This is the first time that EEA has produced EU-wide estimates of total greenhouse gas emissions just months after the year in question. The EEA estimates do not take into account the effects of changes in land use. They are based on the publicly available verified EU ETS emissions for 2008 and other national and European sources, available as of mid-July 2009. The detailed EEA methodology will be published in the coming weeks. These 2008 emission estimates will be used to better track progress towards EU targets in the annual EEA report on greenhouse gas emission trends and projections in Europe, which will be published later this year. The official 2008 greenhouse gas emissions for the EU will be available in June 2010, when the EEA publishes the EU Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990\u20132008 and Inventory Report 2010, to be submitted to the UNFCCC. Notes Under the Kyoto Protocol, the EU-15 has a common commitment to reduce emissions on average by 8 % between 2008 and 2012 compared to emissions in the 'base year'. The base-year emissions for the EU-15 have been fixed to 4 265.5 million tonnes CO2\u2011equivalent. Unlike the EU-15, the EU-27 does not have a common target under the Kyoto Protocol and therefore the EU-27 does not have an applicable base-year against which to compare emission changes.\u00a0 Emission changes compared to 1990 are applicable to the EU-27 as it has made a unilateral commitment to achieve at least a 20 % reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990.

However, reporting of PM emissions from Member States is less complete than for the other main pollutants. In 2007 the top polluting sources in the EU-27 were fuel combustion in households, passenger cars, heavy duty vehicles, and in power plants. Other findings of the report include: The residential sector is an important source of several pollutants. Energy use by households (the burning of wood, gas, coal etc) is the most important source of PM2.5 and NMVOC, the second most important source of CO and is a significant source of both SOx and NOx. The road transport sector remains a major source of air pollution in the EU\u201127. Heavy duty vehicles are the single most important source of NOx, while passenger cars are among the top 6 polluting sources for CO, NOx, PM2.5 and NMVOC. Power plants producing heat and electricity have reduced emissions significantly since 1990 by improving abatement equipment, switching to cleaner fuels and through improved energy efficiency. However the sector remains a large source of air pollution, responsible for around 60 % of all EU-27 SOx emissions and 20 % of total NOx emissions; Agricultural activities in the EU-27 cause more than 90 % of the EU-27's ammonia (NH3) emissions. Ammonia is a particularly important pollutant with respect to Europe's environment, responsible for eutrophication and acidification of ecosystems. The largest Member States are generally responsible for the most air pollution. France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom contributed the most to EU-27 emissions in 2007. Reducing emissions of air pollutants brings significant social and economic benefits: fewer premature deaths and lower health care costs, as the toll from pollution-related diseases is also reduced. In addition, as emissions of air pollutant fall, Europe\u2019s environment suffers less harm to crop production and to natural ecosystems, along with less damage to infrastructure and public buildings caused by corrosive pollutants. Inventory data accessible for experts and the public The European Environment Agency publishes the data from the report in the air pollutant emissions data viewer, a web-based interface that simplifies access and analysis of the data. The data viewer can show emission trends for the main sectors and allows comparison of emissions between different countries and activities. In addition, the data viewer can produce graphics and key emission estimates. What is the LRTAP Convention? Since 1979, the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution has addressed some of the major environmental problems of the member countries of the United Nations' Economic Commission for Europe. The Convention has 51 Parties and aims to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution including long-range transboundary air pollution. Each year, the European Environment Agency assists the European Commission by preparing the European Community's inventory report which is reported to the UNECE Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution Convention (LRTAP). Which air pollutants are covered by the inventory? Under the LRTAP Convention, Parties (including the European Community) are requested to report emissions data for a number of important air pollutants, including sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), primary particulate matter (PM= and PM2.5), heavy metals (HMs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs).

Every year forest fires burn, on average, about 500 000 hectares in Europe \u2014 twice the area of Luxembourg. About 95 % of the total area burnt lies in the Mediterranean region, with most damage occurring during the summer. Although the number of fires in the last decade has increased in Europe, the area burnt has not risen significantly due to improved fire fighting methods. In fact, disturbances such as naturally occurring forest fires are an element of the normal functioning of ecosystems. By creating open environments that return to forest over \u00a0time, fires create a succession of habitats in which different organisms can thrive. Indeed, many species in both the Mediterranean and the northern (boreal) forests depend on such habitats. Paradoxically, in the boreal region fire control is extremely efficient and it has become necessary to carry out planned burnings to create habitats for several threatened fire-dependant species. The Mediterranean presents a different picture. The current fire frequency due to human activity is considered much larger than the natural rate. This constitutes a problem for human settlements and for ecosystem conditions and biodiversity. Excessively frequent fires degrade habitat quality and destroy ecosystems, including forests, which need time to develop. In addition to losing a part of their habitat, forest animals suffer from greater distances between fragmented forest patches. Less connectivity between small forest areas makes it more difficult for animals to ensure a viable gene pool and survive in the long term. Excessive forest fires also wipe out some of the services and benefits we obtain from forest ecosystems, including wood for buildings, paper and fuel, recreational services and food products. The environmental impact of forest fires is not limited to biodiversity and ecosystem services. They also result in emissions of particles and gases (including CO2) into the atmosphere, outflow of mineral nutrients, and destruction of the organic layer of the soil. Furthermore, they alter the water infiltration rates in the soil, making burnt areas more prone to erosion, soil loss and landslides. Excessive forest fires aggravate the extent of damage caused by such natural phenomena to critical levels. Recurrent fires when combined with droughts, especially in southern parts of Europe, may also lead to desertification. Europe's forests at a glance One-third of Europe is now covered by forests, corresponding to 185 million hectares (ha). The total forest area has increased over recent decades. Around 25\u00a0% of the total forest area is excluded from wood harvesting because of its special importance for biodiversity; EEA members and associated countries have reported an almost 40 % increase in protected forest areas from 2000 to 2005. About 87\u00a0% of forests in EEA member and collaborating countries are subject to some degree of human intervention.

Although Europe has steadily reduced emissions of the air pollutants that lead to ozone formation in recent decades, ozone levels remain largely unchanged in many countries. A new report by the European Environment Agency (EEA), released today, explores the reasons for this apparent contradiction, using data from the European air quality database, AirBase, and computer models to investigate ground-level ozone formation in Europe. Key findings The longest time series in AirBase (14\u201316 years) are available for four countries. These indicate that ground-level ozone has declined significantly in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, falling during the 1990s and leveling off thereafter. No significant trends were identified in Austria and Switzerland. Inter-annual variations in weather conditions have a significant impact on yearly ozone levels. Discerning the effect of reduced ozone precursor emissions therefore requires long time series of data from stable monitoring networks. Unfortunately, extended time series are generally unavailable, particularly in southern Europe where ozone pollution is a major problem. Several unknowns complicate attempts to model ozone levels. Significant uncertainties exist regarding the magnitude and distribution of inter-continental inflows of ozone and its precursors, and the size and distribution of isoprene emissions from plants. The importance of meteorological conditions in ozone formation suggests that predicted changes in climate could also lead to increased ground-level ozone in many regions of Europe. Computer modelling was used to estimate the ozone levels that would arise if precursor emissions declined (as countries reported) or if they held constant at 1995 levels. The ozone levels recorded in 18 countries across Europe correspond more closely to the model output based on the assumption of declining emissions. Ground-level ozone has become a hemispheric or even global air pollution and climate change problem. Ozone abatement should be integrated into local, regional and global strategies and measures that simultaneously address emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases.

It should maintain the emphasis given to the intrinsic value of biodiversity while also recognising the value of healthy and resilient ecosystems and the services they provide. EEA Executive Director Professor Jacqueline McGlade The EEA's report \" Progress towards the European 2010 biodiversity target \", finds that European biodiversity is still under serious pressure and that the policy response is not yet adequate to halt the general decline. Biodiversity faces grave risks at the level of genes, species and ecosystems. On 13 July, the European Commission released a ' Composite report' to the European Council and Parliament on the implementation of the Habitats Directive. Responding to the two reports' findings, EEA Executive Director Professor Jacqueline McGlade said: \"Europe's biodiversity is still under serious pressure and faces grave risks. Although we will miss the target of halting the biodiversity loss in Europe by 2010, some progress is being made. As [EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas] said recently in Athens, the post-2010 target should be ambitious, measurable and clear. It should maintain the emphasis given to the intrinsic value of biodiversity while also recognising the value of healthy and resilient ecosystems and the services they provide\". The next major assessment based on the indicators will be done in 2010. Key findings from the EEA report Substantial progress has been made in protecting habitats. Some 17 % of EU land area is now included in the Natura 2000 network and 16 % protected under national schemes across 39 countries. Around 40-85 % of habitats and 40-70 % of species of European interest have an unfavourable conservation status. Grasslands and wetlands across Europe are particularly at risk. Legislation on atmospheric emissions, freshwater quality and waste water treatment has reduced the pressure on biodiversity. Specific measures have also relieved agriculture-related pressures, although further efforts are required. Water quality has generally improved in fresh waters. Overexploitation of marine fisheries remains a threat to marine ecosystems, with some 45 % of assessed European stocks falling outside safe biological limits. Invasive alien species remain a threat, increasingly so in marine systems. Urban sprawl and abandonment of agricultural land put pressure on natural and semi-natural areas. Forest fragmentation is another key threat and has increased since 1990. SEBI 2010 in brief The SEBI 2010 process aims to ensure consistency between biodiversity indicator sets at the national and international levels, while trying to give a coherent and relevant assessment of the state of biodiversity in Europe. The SEBI 2010 set currently comprises 26 indicators. SEBI 2010 relies on the contribution of more than 120 experts from across Europe, as well as input from intergovernmental organisations and NGOs. Its institutional partners are the European Environment Agency (and its European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity), the European Centre for Nature Conservation, the United Nations Environment Programme's World Conservation Monitoring Centre, the European Commission, the Joint Secretariat of the Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy (PEBLDS), and the Czech Republic (as lead country for the Kiev Resolution on Biodiversity's Action Plan on Monitoring and Indicators). The SEBI 2010 process covers 53 countries across Europe.

Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency This year's theme for World Environment Day is 'Your Planet needs You! Unite to combat climate change' \u2013 a topic that reflects everyone\u2019s individual responsibility to protect the planet, as well as the urgency for nations to agree on a new climate change deal in December 2009. World Environment Day is truly a People's Day: it is the chance for everyone, young and old, with their community or with close friends, to show that they care for the planet. In Denmark, World Environment Day will be celebrated with a public premiere of the new film 'HOME' created by world-renowned photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand. Using the stunning aerial footage that is Arthus-Bertrand's trademark, the film \u2014 shot in more than 50 countries \u2014 makes an urgent appeal for our planet in peril and all its treasures, arguing that we have barely ten years left to reverse its degradation. The premiere in Copenhagen will take place at Kongens Nytorv from 11:00 \u2013 17:00 on 5 June . Along with the premiere in Copenhagen, the film \u2014 partly financed by the French Government \u2014 will be launched at more than 100 locations around the world. Screenings \u2014 including star-studded premieres at the Eiffel Tower and in New York City's Central Park \u2013 will be free of charge, and the film will also be available for free download on YouTube. The screening in Copenhagen is a joint event arranged by the European Environment Agency and the six United Nations agencies located in Denmark. In August, the Danish Film Institute in Copenhagen (Cinemateket) will show multiple screenings of 'HOME' along with special presentations organised by the European Environment Agency. World Environment Day 2009 comes just under 190 days before the UN climate convention meeting in Copenhagen. As millions of people around the world prepare to celebrate the event, and in the spirit of the WED slogan 'Unite to combat climate change', the UN has launched the Seal the Deal campaign to call for world leaders to agree on a climate change deal that will protect people and the planet. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Denmark less than two weeks ago. On that occasion he encouraged private sector leaders to take responsibility for the climate. 'But we all have a responsibility,' Ban Ki-moon says in a World Environment Day statement: \u00a0'On this World Environment Day, I encourage all people to take concrete steps toward making the planet greener and cleaner. Switch off the lights. Take public transportation. Recycle. Plant a tree. Clean up your local park. Hold corporations responsible for their environmental practices. And urge your government representatives to Seal the Deal in Copenhagen'. Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency, says: 'Governments across the world have been striving to avoid a deepening global recession, involving stimulus packages with sums so vast that most of us are unable to comprehend the figures involved. In parallel, our natural world, through the pressures from climate change and ecosystem loss, is on the verge of collapse. Here too, governments are working to develop high level targets and strategies to reign in the worst effects.' 'In both cases there is a common thread; the political, economic and administrative mechanisms leave citizens sidelined,' says Professor McGlade, adding: 'World Environment Day is an opportunity for us all to get involved in something which is critical for our shared future and work in a co-ordinated manner to empower us all to play an active role in protecting our environment.'

Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director Falling emissions since 2005 have largely resulted from the lower use of fossil fuels (particularly oil and gas) in households and services \u2014 these sectors, not covered by the EU Emission Trading System (ETS), are among the largest sources of GHG emissions in the EU. Warmer weather and higher fuel prices were the primary causes for the drop in emissions in 2006\u20132007, with most of the decrease occurring in households \u2014 particularly in Germany. Welcoming the reductions, Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, stressed that EU Member States need to take positive steps to sustain progress in coming years. \"The economic stimulus packages that Governments are currently adopting represent a crucial opportunity to address the climate crisis and the financial crisis simultaneously\", Professor McGlade said. \"A strong Copenhagen agreement later this year would drive forward investments vital to our future prosperity.\" Selected highlights of the report Seventeen EU Member States reduced GHG emissions in 2007. Among EU-15 States, all but Spain and Greece reduced emissions. GHG emissions from international aviation and maritime transport, currently excluded in the national totals, have grown steadily since 1990, reaching 6 % of total EU emissions in 2007. The report includes for the first time information on the use of data and emissions reported under the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) for the purposes of preparing national GHG inventories in the EU-15. Most Member States used the ETS data to improve and refine the estimation and reporting of CO2 emissions. The report also contains, for the first time, key information about Member State emission allowances under the Kyoto Protocol. Inventory data becomes more accessible for experts and the public The European Environment Agency has updated the data in the greenhouse gas (GHG) data viewer, a web-based interface that simplifies access and analysis of the data in the GHG inventory report. The GHG data viewer can show emission trends for the main sectors and allows comparison of emissions between different countries and activities. In addition, the data viewer can produce graphics and key emission estimates. Background on the inventory report The EEA report ' Annual European Community greenhouse gas inventory 1990\u20132007 and inventory report 2009' has been submitted to the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as the European Community's official submission.. The UNFCCC, with 192 Parties, is the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Their common goal is to stabilise GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the climate system.

Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA Commissioner for the Environment Stavros Dimas said: \"High quality bathing water is essential for the well-being of European citizens and the environment \u2014 and this goes for all other bodies of water too. I am pleased to see that the overall quality of water in bathing areas is improving throughout the Union.\" Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency, added, \"Information sources like this report and our web-based viewing tools enable citizens not only to check the quality of the bathing water in their local community or holiday destination, but also to allow them to get more actively involved in the protection of their environment.\" Bathing water quality shows a long-term upward trend Every summer millions of Europeans head for the beach to enjoy the sun and to cool down in refreshing clean water. To allow Europeans to make an informed choice on which beach to choose, the Commission publishes a yearly report on the quality of coastal and freshwater bathing areas as reported by Member States for the beaches located within their territory. This year the report was prepared by the European Environment Agency (EEA), which is also making available on its website maps and tables with detailed information on specific bathing areas.\u00a0 In 2008 the number of bathing waters monitored increased by some 75 sites. Of the 21 400 bathing areas monitored throughout the European Union in 2008 two thirds were on the coast and the rest were along rivers and lakes. The largest number of coastal bathing waters can be found in Italy, Greece, France, Spain and Denmark while Germany and France have the highest number of inland bathing waters. The overall quality of bathing waters in the EU has markedly improved since 1990. Compliance with mandatory values (minimum quality requirements) increased over the 1990 to 2008 period from 80 % to 96 % and from 52 % to 92 % in coastal and inland waters respectively. From 2007 to 2008 compliance increased both for inland and coastal waters (1.1 and 3.3 percentage points respectively). Twelve Member States monitoring under the new bathing directive Bathing areas are zones where bathing is explicitly authorised or where bathing is traditionally practised by a large number of bathers and is not prohibited. To determine their quality bathing waters are tested against a number of physical, chemical and microbiological parameters for which the Bathing Water Directive[1] sets out mandatory values. Member States must comply with the mandatory values but may adopt the stricter standards and non-binding guide values. In 2006 a new bathing water directive [2] took effect which updated the parameters and monitoring provisions in line with the latest scientific knowledge. The new Directive places greater emphasis on providing information to the public on the quality of bathing areas. Member States have until 2015 to fully implement the new Directive but twelve Member States (Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden) already monitored their bathing areas during the 2008 bathing season according to the parameters of the new Directive.

When the world committed in 2002 to reducing the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010, Europe went one step further and pledged to halt the loss completely on its territory.\u00a0 As the magnitude of the task and the challenges become more and more apparent, the EU biodiversity policy develops accordingly. To this end, the European Environment Agency (EEA) along with other institutions will increasingly focus on assisting policy-makers and other actors by delivering relevant and reliable data to address their needs. Over the next five years, through the Shared Environmental Information System, Inspire and the environmental data centres, the EEA has pledged to provide quality-assured data to support European reporting initiatives, most notably the nature directives. The Agency has also committed itself to produce analyses on the state and trends of species and habitats. Some of these studies will be based on a set of 26 indicators, known as 'Streamlining European 2010 Biodiversity Indicators' (SEBI 2010).

Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA Last week was a turning point for biodiversity policy discussions. Two crucial meetings \u2014 the G8 environment meeting in Syracuse, Italy, and the high-level conference in Athens, Greece, organised by the European Commission \u2014 recognised the close links between climate change and biodiversity loss and the fact that neither can be solved without addressing the other.

Ecosystems provide many services to human society, including carbon storage and climate regulation and water flows. Tackling climate change means using natural resources sustainably to maintain ecosystem services. Numerous countries have launched greening initiatives with this in mind. And many governments responding to the current financial crisis have put greening the economy at the centre of their stimulus packages. What is EURECA? The EEA launched the EURECA (European Ecosystem Assessment) initiative to contribute to the follow-up process of the UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. EURECA will address the stocks, flows and value of selected ecosystem goods and services using a variety of policy-relevant scenarios. The EEA will deliver the first assessments in 2011, with more following in subsequent years. EURECA will give particular attention to improving our knowledge of how ecosystems function, the services they provide, involving stakeholders and developing tools for political decision-making in Europe. It will provide a platform for people to exchange knowledge and bring national assessments together at a European level. EURECA timeline The first phase of EURECA was completed at the end of 2008. There will be regular updates of the EURECA findings throughout 2009\u20132013. The aim will be to support and influence a range of important international processes. Building on the SEBI (Streamlining European Biodiversity Indicators) work assessing the 2010 biodiversity target at Convention of Biological Diversity COP10 and the setting of new European targets, EURECA will contribute to the follow-up to the global Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and 'Rio +20' in 2012. Specifically for the EU, EURECA will contribute to the review of the 6th Environment Action Programme and progress reports on the implementation of the EU Biodiversity Action Plan, together with the SEBI indicators. EURECA's long-term perspective and flexible approach will allow updates on the state of Europe's ecosystems to be fed into the European Union's dynamic policy agenda, which will face many new challenges in the coming years, including globalisation, climate change, migration, security of natural resources and demographic changes.

Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA The event, held in Athens on 27 and 28 April, brings together policymakers and experts to explore future priorities and options for EU biodiversity policy. Despite significant progress in certain aspects of biodiversity, recent observations indicate that Europe will miss its target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010. The EEA's core messages are clear: to maintain biodiversity and ecosystems,\u00a0we urgently need to integrate\u00a0them more into key\u00a0sectors, such as agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Currently, the price we pay for goods and services does not\u00a0reflect their\u00a0impact on\u00a0the ecosystems that sustain them.\u00a0In order to\u00a0feed into ongoing policy discussions, more effective tools should be developed to assess\u00a0the state\u00a0of biodiversity and its impacts on other environmental concerns. Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA, called for better ecosystem accounting, which reflects the real value of the natural capital that we deplete through our economic activity.\"External pressures on biodiversity are not uniform or held in place by geographical designations, and we must not focus all our efforts on preserving islands of biodiversity, while losing nature everywhere else\", she said. Policymakers and citizens alike depend on reliable and relevant information in order to take sound decisions and actions. Two key sources of information on the state of biodiversity in Europe, namely SEBI 2010 (Streamlining European Biodiversity Indicators) and Article 17 of the EU's Habitats Directive, were at the heart of the overview presented by Professor McGlade. The complete set of SEBI 2010 findings will be available as an EEA report, to be published online on World Biodiversity Day, 22 May. Additionally, the European Commission will present an overall assessment of Article 17 findings in the coming months. Country summaries and regional assessments are already available through the European Topic Centre on Biodiversity\u2019s website. Snapshot of biodiversity in Europe The overall status and trends are not favourable, despite some progress. Promoting conservation and sustainable farming practices, especially in High Nature Value farmlands, is crucial for biodiversity. Nitrogen surpluses are declining but generally remain high, particularly in lowland western Europe. Pollution levels in the marine environment are stable but about 45 % of assessed European stocks are outside safe biological limits. Wood harvesting is sustainable but deadwood in most European countries remains well below optimal levels from a biodiversity perspective. SEBI 2010 in brief The SEBI 2010 process was started in 2005 to provide a streamlined set of biodiversity indicators for Europe. It does not create new monitoring or reporting obligations for countries. Instead it aims to ensure consistency between biodiversity indicator sets at the national and international levels. The current set includes 26 indicators. SEBI 2010 relies on the contribution of more than 120 experts from across Europe, as well as input from intergovernmental organisations and NGOs. Its institutional partners are the European Environment Agency (and its European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity), the European Centre for Nature Conservation, the United Nations Environment Programme's World Conservation Monitoring Centre, the European Commission, the Joint Secretariat of the Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy (PEBLDS), and the Czech Republic (as lead country for the Kiev Resolution on Biodiversity\u2019s Action Plan on Monitoring and Indicators). The SEBI 2010 process covers 53 countries across Europe.

The data viewer can generate customised graphs and tables showing emissions released by combustion plants, oil refineries, coke ovens, iron and steel plants, and factories making cement, glass, lime, brick, ceramics, pulp and paper in any EU Member State. Data comes from the CITL (Community Independent Transaction Log) and will be updated once 2008 emissions data are complete. The viewer shows, for the first time, emissions data from the second trading period (2008-2012) of the EU ETS. This phase corresponds to the initial commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol during which EU Member States must meet their targets for limiting or reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. The EU ETS viewer has a similar look and feel to some of the popular data viewing tools released by the European Environment Agency, such as the greenhouse gas viewer. About the EU Emission Trading Scheme The EU ETS is the largest multi-country, multi-sector greenhouse gas emission trading scheme world-wide. It is based on the Directive 2003/87/EC and started operating in January 2005. The ultimate goal of the EU ETS is to help combat climate change under the Kyoto Protocol and is the first international trading system for GHG in the world. The scheme covers more than 12 000 installations in the 27 Member States ranging from oil refineries and power plants to cement, iron and ceramic production facilities. Emissions from these sectors account for nearly 40 % of the European Union total greenhouse gas emissions. About the Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL) The Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL) checks and records all transactions of emission allowances between operators in the Scheme.

However, many vehicles rolling off production lines are anything but green, the freight sector still favours the least efficient transport modes and railways across the EU still do not have a unified system. Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director The findings are set out in the report 'Transport at a crossroads', launched today at the European Parliament in Brussels by Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, \"We know the technology exists to tackle impacts of the transport sector on Europe's environment. However, many vehicles rolling off production lines are anything but green, the freight sector still favours the least efficient transport modes and railways across the EU still do not have a unified system.\" \"At a time when we need to tackle our economic and environmental problems through sustainable and green solutions, trends in transport are pointing in the wrong direction; and will continue to contribute to air pollution, rising emissions of greenhouse gas and many negative environmental impacts.\" said Professor McGlade. Emissions of GHG have increased by 26 % or 180 million tonnes, between 1990 and 2006, excluding international aviation and marine transport (EU-15). Representing a higher increase than the annual national emissions for 2006 from Belgium; 132 million tonnes, or Romania; 157million tonnes.(1) Between 1996 and 2006 the total freight volume measured in tonne-kilometres for EU member states increased by 35 % or 650 M tonne-km, significantly more than the total freight transport of Germany. Rail freight and inland waterways saw a decline in market share Between 1995 and 2006 car ownership levels in EU-27 increased by 22 %, or 52 Million cars. Representing an increase equivalent to the entire fleet of UK and Spain put together. The number of kilometres travelled by passengers in EEA member countries grew by 65million kilometres in 2006. Air pollutants from vehicles are declining, but air quality is still a problem across Europe Decoupling transport growth from economic growth Well designed policies to manage demand for transport can reduce transport volumes. This would improve the transport efficiency of the economy and decouple transport growth from economic growth. The report also confirms that price signals play a major role in the choices made by consumers; with a 20% increase in demand for bus services related to a 10% increase in fuel prices. \"We still need clear, measurable, realistic and time related targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, air emissions and noise from transport. Perhaps more critically, consumers have indicated through their reaction to volatile prices last year, that fuel and road pricing clearly has a role to play in tackling transport demand.\" says Professor McGlade. Background on the report The report 'Transport at a crossroads' is the annual publication from the EEA's Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism (TERM), which monitors the progress and effectiveness of attempts to integrate transport and environment strategies. TERM reports have been published since 2000 and offer important insights that can help the development of EU policies. The report aims to cover all EEA member countries.

In addition to these daily peaks above EU thresholds, one in ten Europeans was exposed throughout the year to persistent PM10 levels higher than the EU\u2019s annual mean limit. Across the EU, PM10 is estimated to have caused approximately 373 000 premature deaths in 2005. Large areas of eastern Europe and the Po Valley in northern Italy but also parts of the Balkans, Belgium, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain were particularly likely to record daily levels above the limit, especially in more urbanized environments. Urban areas of the Balkans, the Czech Republic, Hungary, southern Poland and southern Spain were especially likely to report excessive levels throughout the year. The report records similar findings for ground-level ozone, with more than a third of the European population exposed to ozone levels higher than the EU\u2019s target value. Health impacts of ozone appear to be lower than those of PM10, ranging from 75 premature deaths per million inhabitants (for south-eastern and southern Europe) to less than 10 per million (northern and north-western Europe) in 2005. Number of ozone episodes down but\u2026 The second technical report \"Air pollution by ozone across Europe during summer 2008\" asserts that, by several measures, ozone levels during last summer were the lowest since Europe-wide reporting began in 1997. Nevertheless, all EU Member States and eight other European countries exceeded the long-term objectives set by EU legislation. With measurements of 399 and 302 \u03bcg per cubic metre, the highest one-hour concentrations were recorded in Lazio region in Italy. Several measuring stations in Belgium, Greece, Italy, Spain and Switzerland also reported high concentrations of between 240 and 300 \u03bcg per cubic metre. Overview of air quality limits EU air quality legislation sets two legally binding limit values for PM10 mass concentrations: annual mean levels exceeding 40 \u03bcg PM10 per cubic metre; PM10 concentrations exceeding 50 \u03bcg cubic metre on more than 35 days per year. A new air quality directive was adopted in April 2008. For the first time, it sets legally binding limit values for PM2.5 levels (fine particulate matter) to be attained in 2015.

The short-term solution to water scarcity has been to extract ever greater amounts of water from our surface and groundwater assets. Overexploitation is not sustainable. It has a heavy impact on the quality and quantity of the remaining water as well as the ecosystems which depend on it. We have to cut demand, minimise the amount of water that we are extracting and increase the efficiency of its use. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA The EEA report 'Water resources across Europe \u2013 confronting water scarcity and drought' highlights that while southern Europe continues to experience the greatest water scarcity problems, water stress is growing in parts of the north too. Moreover, climate change will cause the severity and frequency of droughts to increase in the future, exacerbating water stress, especially during the summer months. Excluding illegal water use, Europe abstracts around 285 km3 of freshwater annually, representing on average 530 m3 per capita. \"We are living beyond our means when it comes to water. The short-term solution to water scarcity has been to extract ever greater amounts of water from our surface and groundwater assets. Overexploitation is not sustainable. It has a heavy impact on the quality and quantity of the remaining water as well as the ecosystems which depend on it,\" said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of EEA. \"We have to cut demand, minimise the amount of water that we are extracting and increase the efficiency of its use.\" Key findings and recommendations Shifting the management focus from increasing supply to minimising demand needs to involve various different policies and practices: In all sectors, including agriculture, water should be priced according to the volume used. Governments should implement drought management plans more extensively and focus on risk rather than crisis management. Water-intensive bioenergy crops should be avoided in areas of water scarcity. A combination of crop selection and irrigation methods can substantially improve agricultural water efficiency if backed-up with farmer advisory programmes. National and EU funds including the European Union\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy can play an important role in promoting efficient and sustainable water use in agriculture. Measures to raise public awareness, such as eco-labelling, eco-certification, education programmes in schools, are essential to realise sustainable water use. Leakage in public water supply systems must be addressed. In parts of Europe, water loss via leakage can exceed 40 % of total supplies. Illegal abstraction of water, often for agricultural use, is widespread in certain areas of Europe. Appropriate surveillance and a system of fines or penalties should be put in place to address the issue. Authorities should create incentives for greater use of alternative water supplies, such as treated wastewater, greywater, and \u2018harvested\u2019 rainwater, to help reduce water stress. Overview of water use in Europe In Europe as a whole, 44 % of abstraction is used for energy production, 24 % for agriculture, 21 % for public water supply and 11 % for industry. However, these figures mask significant differences in sectoral water use across the continent. In southern Europe, for example, agriculture accounts for 60 % of the total water abstracted and reaches as much as 80 % in certain areas. Across Europe, surface waters, such as lakes and rivers, provide 81 % of the total freshwater abstracted and are the predominant water source for industry, energy and agriculture. By contrast, public water supply relies mostly on groundwater due to its generally higher quality. Almost all water used in energy production is returned to a water body, whereas most of the water abstracted for agriculture is not. Desalination has become a fast growing alternative to conventional sources of water, particularly in water-stressed regions of Europe. Its high energy needs and the resulting brine must be taken into account, however, when assessing desalination\u2019s overall impact on the environment.

Finding, reading and understanding the range of 'signals' regarding the health and diversity of our environment is at the heart of what the Agency does. EEA Signals 2009, which will be published in all 26 EEA languages, takes a story-based approach to provide a snapshot of key environmental topics of special relevance to the year ahead. \"2009 offers a remarkable opportunity to engage the global community and to begin to deal with the environmental challenge proper. We need to move carefully but quickly.\u00a0 The scale of the challenge should neither paralyse us into inaction nor stifle valuable debate. In this context, I welcome the EEA Signals, which is aimed at the broad range of European citizens,\" Minister Bursik said. The stories in EEA Signals are not exhaustive but have been selected on the basis of their relevance to the current environmental policy debate in Europe. They address priority issues of climate change, nature and biodiversity, the use of natural resources and health and the environment. \"As our need to mitigate and adapt to climate change becomes more urgent, so our need to communicate effectively with a wide audience also increases in importance.

Europeans enjoy affordable and convenient access to an increased number of leisure and business destinations around the globe, says the report, but both work and holiday-related mobility is more and more dependant on air travel. Tourism strategies are favouring new forms of vacation such as \u201ccity breaks\u201d, in addition to an increased flow of people flying to meet their families over holiday seasons. Parents choose to drive their children to school due to poor transport alternatives and fears over road safety, contributing to road congestion. The EEA report brings out policy examples that can moderate transport demand and, in some cases, balance the negative effects of greater mobility for citizens and freight. Including aviation in the EU Emission Trading Scheme \u2014as agreed recently by EU Member States\u2014 supports the goal of addressing increased demand for air transport by internalising its external costs. Other findings include the following: Policy makers should ensure citizens are well informed about the carbon footprint of their commuting and holiday travel Labelling schemes for food should be improved, displaying the environmental effects of the chain from \u201cfarm to fork\u201d. Businesses are encouraged to switch to teleconferencing as an effective way to cut on both greenhouse gas emissions and travel costs. Individual travel planning and better land and urban planning can be instrumental in decreasing travel distances \u2014reducing distances between schools and residential areas.

Preliminary results were reported in May this year. The NOx challenge Even taking into account NOx control measures already in place within the Member States, the NOx emissions for the EU-27 as a whole are still projected to be 9 % above the aggregated Member State limits (known as the Annex I ceiling) and 20 % above the stricter ceiling for the European Community as a whole (the Annex II ceiling) set for 2010. Some Member States including the Netherlands, Sweden and Germany expect to emit only slightly more NOx than their ceilings. Others, such as Ireland, Austria and Spain, are projected to miss substantially their targets by as much as up to 50 %. This is partly due to higher-than-expected growth in road transport that has occurred since the ceilings were set. Moreover, the estimated gains from policy measures, which were in discussion at the time, have proven less effective than originally anticipated (e.g. the effectiveness of certain vehicle emission controls). Such factors have led several Member States to change their projections in the last few years and announce that they now expect to miss their NOx targets. However, Belgium and Germany have reported plans to implement additional measures which may allow them to comply with their 2010 emissions ceilings for NOx. The other Member States which are not on track will also need to develop and present such plans. Other ceilings on track For the other three pollutants (SO2, NMVOCs, NH3), most EU Member States are expected to reduce their emissions beyond their commitments. As a result, the EU as a whole is expected to register substantial reductions. In the case of NMVOCs, EU-27 emissions are projected to be 9 % below the Annex I ceiling, but 6 % above the stricter Annex II ceiling.

Background information The NEC Directive sets pollutant-specific and legally-binding emission ceilings for each Member State to meet by 2010. It requires the countries to report annually\u00a0information concerning emissions and projections for the four air pollutants: SO2, NOx, NMVOC and NH3. These pollutants are deposited in soils and waters and damage ecosystems by acidification and eutrophication. They also contribute to the formation of ozone and particulate matter, which are harmful to human health as well as to ecosystems and vegetation. The current EEA report is based on the 2007 reporting cycle, where Member States provided final emissions data for 2005 and preliminary data for 2006, as well as projected emissions for 2010. By the end of this year, they are required to submit updated 2010 estimates, together with final 2006 and preliminary 2007 data. Data in this report is also available through the NECD emissions dataviewer. Annex I of the NEC Directive defines both country-based ceilings and aggregated emission ceilings for the EU-27 (which are the sums of the individual Member State ceilings in that Annex). Annex II also defines SO2, NOx and NMVOC ceilings for the EU-27 as a whole. These ceilings are stricter than those in Annex I and are designed with the aim of attaining by 2010 the interim environmental objectives set out in the directive (i.e. reduction of acidification, health- and vegetation-related ground-level ozone exposure by 2010 compared with the 1990 situation).", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/eu-to-exceed-air-pollutant-limit-due-to-growth-in-road-transport"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0603", "date": "2008-11-28", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Climate change conference opens in Poland", "text": "A total of 192 countries have ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the most important agreement for international actions to tackle climate change.

The sector continues to have significant impacts on the environment, despite the fact that more efficient production of electricity and heat, together with an increased share of renewable energy sources and replacement of coal and oil with gas are gradually contributing to cut emissions of greenhouse gas and air pollutants in Europe. The 2008 Energy and environment report confirms that if Europeans simply stick by current policies and measures, energy consumption will continue to rise by up to 26 % by 2030 \u2014and fossil fuels will remain as the main source of supply. \"Business as usual is not an option for the energy sector\" stated Professor Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director at the launch of the report in the European Parliament in\u00a0 Strasbourg today. The move towards a low carbon society \"isn't happening fast enough to secure the future of our environment\", she said. \"Energy from fossil fuels is the root cause of human induced climate change\" Professor McGlade told the Joint Parliamentary Meeting on Energy and Sustainable Development today. \"The commitment of Europe to a post carbon economy and sustainable renewable energy is essential for energy security and tacking climate change\" she added. The 2008 Energy and environment report reported some positive findings with regard to the growth of the renewable energy sector and its potential to reduce emissions and improve air quality. But renewable sources only represented 8.6 % of the final energy consumption in Europe in 2005 \u2014 some way short of the EU target to achieve 20 % by 2020. Other key findings of the report include: European households have increased their electricity consumption by 31% in the last 15 years, in spite of an average increase by 17 % in end-user electricity prices compared to the mid 1990s. Over 54 % of the energy used in Europe in 2005 was imported from outside its borders. Russia is the largest single energy exporter to the EU, supplying 18.1 % of the EU-27 total primary energy consumption in 2005. Between 1990 and 2005, the EU-27 experienced an average GDP growth rate of 2.1 %, while reducing its energy-related CO2 emissions by a total of about 3 %. During the same period, CO2 emissions increased by 20 % in the US and doubled in China. \u00a0 Notes for the editors: The 2008 Energy and environment report (available on the EEA website) assesses the key drivers, environmental pressures and impacts from the production and consumption of energy, taking into account the main objectives of the European policy on energy and environment including: security of supply, competitiveness, increased energy efficiency and renewable energy, and environmental sustainability.

Speaking at the International Conference to mark the 10th Anniversary of the Aarhus Convention, Professor McGlade commended the agreement as a \"cornerstone in our ability to respond\" to global environmental challenges, saying the Convention \"has paved the way for a strengthened participation in environmental protection\". The EEA is developing tools to bridge the gap between researchers, decision-makers and citizens. The Global Citizen\u2019s Observatory for Environmental Change launched by the EEA earlier this year is an example of useful data to the public, and of involvement of the public. The observatory provides near-real time information on bathing water quality, and lets the public voice their own opinions on the quality of beaches and bathing water. The Aarhus Convention gave citizens from 35 European countries the right to receive information on the state of the environment and on the state of human health and safety where this is a consequence of environmental deterioration.

The report quantifies the benefits to be gained through the optimal use of the EU's domestic bioenergy potential. Substantial emission reductions possible Bioenergy produced within the EU could lead to greenhouse gas emission reductions of up to 8 % in 2020 compared to the EU-25's 1990 levels, and up to 13 % in 2030, the report says. Around 9.5 % of Europe\u2019s final energy demand in 2020 could be met from bioenergy. This corresponds to almost half of the 20 % target being discussed by the European Union. In 2030, bioenergy\u2019s share in the gross energy consumption of the EU-25 could reach 16 %. In this scenario, bioenergy would meet 18.1 % of European demand for heat, 12.5 % of electricity demand and 5.4 % of transport fuel demand (7% of the diesel and gasoline demand in road transport) in 2030. The key role of policy Increasing bioenergy production might have adverse effects on the environment, including soil erosion, threats to biodiversity and water resources, and changes in land use. Such adverse effects might jeopardise the EU's overall environmental goals. On the other hand, an appropriate choice and management of energy crops can actually decrease soil erosion or water pollution risks from agricultural practices, and provide certain biodiversity benefits. Measures to protect soil and water resources as well as biodiversity are best taken at local and regional levels. This report does not take into account potential imports of biomass and the possible impacts of EU bioenergy targets on the environment outside the EU. A complete understanding of the overall environmental impact and greenhouse gas balance of EU bioenergy policies requires a broader evaluation of their direct and indirect effects around the globe. More information Bioenergy is obtained from biomass \u2013 mainly biological plant material such as trees and crops, and organic waste. In addition to energy, plant biomass provides a wide range of products from food, feed, clothing, paper to construction materials.

A few Member States are still off their Kyoto track. However, if the expected outstanding performance of other Member States is taken into account, the EU-15 as a whole should meet its Kyoto commitment. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA The report, \"Greenhouse gas emission trends and projections in Europe 2008\" evaluates historic emissions from 1990\u20132006. It also looks at projections of future emissions during the Kyoto Protocol commitment period (2008\u20132012). Overall, projections from Member States for the Kyoto period indicate that the EU-15 could cut emissions by more than 11\u00a0% compared to the base-year. This could be achieved by a combination of domestic policies and measures (in force and planned), carbon sink activities and credits for emission reductions outside EU. \"Emission performance remains mixed in the EU-15. A few Member States are still off their Kyoto track. However, if the expected outstanding performance of other Member States is taken into account, the EU-15 as a whole should meet its Kyoto commitment,\" said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency. \"In addition, the situation would look better for some Member States if their projections took full account of the emission restrictions facing their industries covered by the EU Emission Trading Scheme.\" The report also gives a long-term estimate of the emissions situation in Europe. Although emissions are projected to continue decreasing until 2020 in the EU-27, the 20\u00a0% reduction target compared to 1990, endorsed by European leaders in 2007, will remain out of reach without the implementation of additional measures, such as the EU energy and climate change package proposed by the European Commission in January 2008. Data show that the 15 EU Member States sharing a common target under the Kyoto Protocol (EU-15) achieved a reduction of their greenhouse gases by 2.7\u00a0% between the base year and 2006. The policies and measures in place as of today will not be sufficient for the EU-15 to meet its Kyoto target, as they are expected to push down emissions between 2006 and 2010 to an average level only 3.6\u00a0% below the base-year emissions. If the additional measures planned by 10 Member States were fully implemented and on time, a further reduction of 3.3\u00a0% could be obtained. The full effect of the EU Emission Trading Scheme is not reflected in all Member States' projections. Most EU-15 Member States intend to use carbon sinks \u2014 such as planting forests that absorb CO2 \u2014 to achieve their Kyoto target. The total amount of carbon dioxide that could be removed annually between 2008 and 2012 is relatively small (1.4\u00a0% compared to 1990), although it is somewhat higher than the projections made in 2007. Ten EU-15 Member States have planned to use the Kyoto Mechanisms (see notes to the editor below) to achieve their targets. This is expected to reduce emissions by a further 3.0\u00a0%. The EEA report singles out the case of those countries that have promised \"significant emission reductions in a limited time frame (2006\u20132010) from policies and measures that have not been implemented yet\". In addition, countries which project significant emission reductions from 2006 to meet their target by 2010 will actually have to sustain their efforts and further reduce emissions until 2012. In the end, some Member States might make use of Kyoto mechanisms more intensively than they are currently planning. The overall EU-15 Kyoto target of \u2013\u00a08\u00a0% corresponds to differentiated emission targets for each Member State. In 2006, four EU-15 Member States (France, Greece, Sweden and the United Kingdom) had already reached a level below their Kyoto target. Eight additional EU-15 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Portugal) project that they will achieve their targets, but projections from three Member States (Denmark, Italy and Spain) indicate that they will not meet their emission reduction goals. However, the report notes that gaps between targets and predictions are much narrower than the projections made in 2007. Ten of the 12 Member States that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 have individual reduction targets of 6 or 8\u00a0%. Only Cyprus and Malta do not have a target. In the EU-12, the Member States project that they will achieve their Kyoto targets despite projected increases in emissions between 2006 and 2010. Slovenia is the only one of these Member States planning to use the Kyoto mechanisms to meet its target. The executive summary of the report and the country profiles are already available online. The full report will be published in November. \u00a0 Overview of progress for EU Member States and other EEA member countries National projections for 2010 (1) Planned measures by 2010 EU-15 Member States EU-12 Member States Other EEA member countries Countries meeting their Kyoto or burden sharing target Existing domestic policies and measures Germany (2) Greece (2) Sweden (2) United Kingdom (2) Bulgaria Czech Republic (2) Estonia Hungary Latvia Lithuania Poland (2) Romania Slovakia Iceland Existing and planned domestic policies and measures France (2) Croatia (2) (3) Domestic policies and measures Use of Kyoto mechanisms Austria (2) Belgium Finland (2) Ireland (2) Luxembourg Netherlands (2) Portugal (2) Slovenia (2) Liechtenstein Norway Countries not meeting their Kyoto or burden sharing target Domestic policies and measures Use of Kyoto mechanisms Denmark (2) Italy (2) Spain (2) Switzerland No Kyoto target Cyprus Malta Turkey Note: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1) National projections provided by 1 June 2008 were taken into account in the report.

Progress towards its Kyoto target is also assessed in the report. Notes to the editor EU Kyoto Targets: The EU-15 has a Kyoto target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 8\u00a0% from base-year levels (see below) by 2012. Within this overall target, each EU-15 member state has a differentiated reduction target; some should reduce emissions while others are allowed a limited increase. New Member States have individual targets except Cyprus and Malta, which have no targets. Countries can achieve these targets by various means. Base-year emissions: Under the Kyoto Protocol the GHG emission level in the 'base year' is the relevant starting point for tracking progress of domestic emissions for EU-15 and all Member States which have a Kyoto target. The EU-27 does not have a Kyoto target and an aggregated base year for the EU-27 is therefore not applicable in any discussion of progress towards Kyoto targets. It is important to clarify that the base year is not a 'year' per se, but the emission level from which emission reductions will take place. For carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, 1990 is used as the 'base year' for all EU-15 Member States. But for fluorinated gases, the EU-15 Member States can choose to use the emission levels in 1995 instead. Twelve of the 15 Member States have chosen to use 1995 as their base year for fluorinated gas emissions. In practice, EU-15 base-year emissions can be considered close to 1990 emissions. EU Emissions Trading Scheme: The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is the European Union's climate change policy tool, which helps industries to cut their CO2 emissions in a cost-effective way. It requires a cap on emissions for all large CO2 emission sources. In the EU-15, the ETS is estimated to cut 3.4\u00a0% from base-year emissions. Domestic policies and measures: Domestic policies and measures take place within the national boundaries of the country and include: the promotion of electricity from renewable energy; improvements in energy efficiency; promotion of biofuels in transport; reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from cars; recovery of gases from landfills and reduction of fluorinated gases. Kyoto mechanisms: The Kyoto Protocol envisages market-based mechanisms that allow industrialised countries to meet their targets by benefiting from emission reductions in other countries. Under these mechanisms, Member States can trade emissions between themselves or acquire credits from emission-cutting projects they finance abroad. These mechanisms also help the transfer of low-carbon technologies to other countries and promote sustainable development. Greenhouse gas emissions are a global problem and reductions can be made where costs are lowest \u2014\u2014 at least in the initial phase of combating climate change. The projected use of Kyoto mechanisms by ten of the EU-15 Member States will reduce emissions by 2010 by 3.0\u00a0% from base-year levels. These countries are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. For more information on Kyoto mechanisms, see the UNFCCC website.

It is therefore possible to observe how land-cover change and fragmentation by road networks affect Europe's most valuable natural areas. Similar analyses can provide insight into the impact on Europe's biodiversity by other factors such as climate change. What initial assessments say on Europe's biodiversity Europe has selected more than 1\u00a0000 species and 216 habitats of 'European interest' defined as being important for the continent's biodiversity. Based on the 2007 country reports submitted to the European Commission, a first analysis of the state of conservation for these species and habitats paints a rather disappointing picture. Only less than half of the protected species and habitats in Europe are considered to be in 'favourable conservation status'. For most of the remaining species and habitats, the conservation status is considered to be either inadequate or bad. Furthermore, for a significant number of species and habitats, the data at hand\u00a0are simply insufficient to reach any assessment. The data also confirm the previous findings with regard to land-cover change as set out in the report\u00a0 The European environment \u2014 State and Outlook\u00a02005, namely that wetlands, dunes and grasslands are among the less well-preserved habitats. In some cases, this degradation is closely linked to local policies and land management in the surrounding areas. The picture is nevertheless mixed. Terrestrial habitats in the Alpine and Mediterranean regions, the coastal and marine habitats in Macaronesia (Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands) and the Mediterranean appear to be enjoying the best conservation status. More information on the state of biodiversity in different biogeographical zones across Europe and in each European country may be obtained from the EEA's Data service. What next? The biodiversity conservation debate is currently moving from increasing the number of protected sites to the effective management and evaluation of the sites. The fact that biodiversity is being lost even in protected areas means that Europe must work towards maintaining and restoring the 'ecological potential' of what is already under protection, while taking the developments in the wider countryside into account. Additional efforts to identify gaps in the data and to assess the effectiveness of current policies are already underway. These gaps must be closed in order to develop the required tailor-made solutions responding to each region's specific problems and needs. Background European countries are legally bound by international and European requirements, including the EU Habitats Directive, to regularly collect and share data on protected areas.

Implementation of adaptation actions has only just started. We need to intensify such actions and improve information exchange on data, effectiveness and costs. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA The report 'Impacts of Europe\u2019s changing climate', based on 40 key indicators, stresses the consequences of both observed and projected changes, including an increased risk of floods and droughts, losses of biodiversity, threats to human health\u00a0 and damage to economic sectors such as energy, transport, forestry, agriculture, and tourism. Adaptation challenges The report highlights that vulnerability to climate change varies widely across regions and sectors in Europe. It shows that the main vulnerable areas in Europe are mountainous regions, coastal zones, the Mediterranean and the Arctic. The report underlines that, in addition to enhanced global greenhouse gas emission reductions, pro-active adaptation measures are also needed to moderate effects. Many of today\u2019s adaptation activities are focused on flood management and defence so there is scope for more action in other sectors. The expected European Commission paper on adaptation will frame a European adaptation strategy. Furthermore, many countries are developing and implementing national adaptation strategies. The report will assist in the development and implementation phase of these plans, for example through the use across all countries of the indicators presented in the report.\u00a0 Too many gaps in climate change information The study also calls for a co-ordinated effort by countries, the European Commission and other organisations to fill key information gaps. We need improved monitoring and reporting of climate data and observed impacts, more detailed spatial and socio-economic scenarios; better information on vulnerability; more information on good practices in adaptation actions and their costs and better information exchange mechanisms. \"This report makes strikingly clear that many regions and sectors across Europe are vulnerable to climate change impacts. Implementation of adaptation actions has only just started. We need to intensify such actions and improve information exchange on data, effectiveness and costs\", says Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. The report proposes the setting up of a European Clearing House on climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to make such data widely available to users, with the support of the EU Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS), the EU Kopernikus programme on global monitoring for environment and security, and in collaboration with the WHO Climate, Environment and Health Information System (CEHAIS). Key findings of the report: Global average temperature has increased almost 0.8 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, with even higher temperature increases in Europe and northern latitudes. Annual precipitation changes are worsening differences between a wet Northern part of Europe and a dry South, with some Mediterranean regions receiving 20% less rain than a century ago. According to satellite observations, global sea level has increased up to 3.1 mm/year in the past 15 years. Uncertainty in the rate of melting of Greenland\u2019s outlet glaciers makes projections of future sea level rise uncertain. Sea level rise can cause coastal flooding, coastal erosion and increased risk of salt water intrusion that could damage coastal ecosystems and wetlands. The reduction in Arctic sea ice has accelerated: in September 2007 the minimum surface was only half the normal minimum measured in the 1950s. Arctic species such as seals, whales and polar bears are under threat. Glacier retreat in Europe\u2019s mountain systems, and the changes in temperature and precipitation, will have widespread consequences. Projections show an overall increase of river floods across Europe but an increase in river droughts in the South. A northward movement of certain fish species \u20141000 km in the past 40 years\u2014can have adverse effects on fisheries, such as reducing cod stocks in the North Sea. Spring phytoplankton blooms in lakes are now occurring up to one month earlier than 30-40 years ago, which may favour harmful cyanobacteria threatening human health and ecosystems. Plants, birds, insects and mammals are moving further north and uphill. By the end of this century, plant species may have shifted several hundred kilometres to the north and up to 60 % of mountain plant species may face extinction. The agricultural growing season is now longer, especially in the North. Although this may favour the introduction of new crops, crop yields will become more variable because extreme weather events are projected to increase. Increasing water demand for agriculture in the Mediterranean region will lead to unsustainable competition for water with tourism and households. The growing season of forests is also changing and the danger of forest fires will increase in southern Europe. Human health is also significantly affected by climate change. The 70,000 excess deaths reported from 12 European countries in 2003 could be an example of health impacts to come. Climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Projected future effects of heat-waves, floods and droughts, worsening air pollution and changes in vectors and plant distribution are likely to harm the health of many people, if global warming is unconstrained. Health system will need to be strengthened and action will need to be taken for particular vulnerable people, like the elderly, children or disadvantaged populations.

Ronan Uhel, Head of Spatial Analysis Group at the EEA Urban sprawl is not driven principally by population growth but by changing lifestyles and consumption patterns as well as lenient, service-driven planning policies. \u201cWe need action to address the three urban-related consumption areas that have been identified as having the highest environmental impacts during their lifecycle: housing, food and drink, and private transport which, together, are responsible for about 65% of material use and 70% of global warming potential,\u201d said Ronan Uhel, Head of the EEA Spatial Analysis group. Structural policies play a key role in either promoting or preventing urban sprawl. In the European Union, significant \u00a0budget transfers from the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds to member states provide powerful drivers of macroeconomic change to support European integration. But the Agency\u2019s analysis shows that they have also had inadvertent socio-economic effects that have promoted the development of urban sprawl. \u201cAlongside reshaping urban planning policies, a green tax reform is necessary, one that gradually shifts taxes away from labour and investments and towards taxes on pollution and the inefficient use of land, materials and energy,\u201d added Mr Uhel. Quick facts on urban sprawl in Europe Today 72% of Europeans live in urban areas. By 2020, this figure will increase to around 80 %, and in several countries it will be 90 % or more. Today more than a quarter of the European Union\u2019s territory is negatively impacted by urban land uptake, due in particular to urban sprawl, which is affecting towns and cities of all sizes across Europe. In the past 10 years alone, the equivalent of five times the size of Greater London has been given up to further sprawl of European cities. Highly urbanised, Europe consumes much more than its biological resources can produce. Therefore it relies not only on its own resources but to a large extent on the resources from other parts of the world. For example, the Council of Greater London has calculated the land and ecological footprint of their city to be equivalent to 293 times its area.

If taking your kids along, try using a skateboard, skipping rope or rollerblades! Remember how much fun it was when you were a kid. Car pool! If you live far away from school, instead of driving your kids to and from school each day, start a car pooling initiative with the other parents and share the responsibility. It will save you time, petrol and help the environment.\u00a0\u00a0 Keep your tyres properly inflated. This will reduce wear and tear on them and increase their longevity, thereby saving money. It also saves precious raw material: it takes 27 litres of crude oil to produce a new tire. Under-inflated tyres also increase fuel consumption by up to 10%. Check your tyres at least once a month. It just takes a few minutes. Slow down! When driving your car, drive steadily and anticipate what is coming up. Avoid rapid accelerations and breaking as much as possible. This will decrease your car\u2019s fuel consumption.

Water is a life-sustaining resource but 'the added complications of climate change, an increase of temperatures and lower river flows will lead to a decrease of water quality', she added. Sustainable water management is essential to guarantee sufficient provision of clean and safe water to ecosystems and the people who depend on them. An increasing number of Europeans \u2014 and not just in the Mediterranean basin \u2014 will most likely be affected by recurrent droughts which could be aggravated by water scarcity due to consumption patterns. Professor McGlade warned against ill-advised decisions in favour of unsustainable large reservoirs, water transfer schemes and desalination plants as solutions to concerns around water availability.

However, other studies show that pollution continues to undermine local air quality, particularly in urban areas. The report identifies road transport, manufacturing industries and construction, the residential sector and agriculture as the main sources of air pollution in Europe today. Exposure to air pollutants may damage health in the short and long term, affect natural ecosystems, and corrode buildings and materials. Particulate matter from sources such as vehicle exhausts and residential heating can affect the lungs and harm people of all ages, but it is known to pose an extra risk to those with existing heart and respiratory problems. Air pollutants are also responsible for the acidification of forests and water ecosystems, and eutrophication of soils and waters \u2014 leading to limited supply of oxygen in rivers and lakes. Between 1990 and 2006, nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions decreased by 35\u00a0%, although the change of total NOx emissions between 2005 and 2006 was small, with a decrease of just 1.8\u00a0%, due to reductions that occurred in Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. Nitrogen oxides are one of the main contributors to the formation of ground-level ozone, high levels of which can trigger severe respiratory problems. It also makes an important contribution to acidification and eutrophication. Electricity and heat production (e.g. at power stations) constitutes the main source of sulphur oxides (SOx) emissions (58.4 %), followed by manufacturing industries and construction sources (14.3 %). SOx is an acidifying pollutant which can also aggravate respiratory diseases. In contrast, agricultural activities are responsible for the vast majority of ammonia (NH3) emissions in EU-27. NH3 is an important pollutant which causes acidification and eutrophication. Livestock manure, together with emissions from the application of fertilisers account for more than 90 % of the NH3 generation. Each year, the European Environment Agency assists the European Commission by preparing the European Community\u2019s inventory report which is reported to the Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution Convention (LRTAP). What is the LRTAP Convention? Since 1979, the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution has addressed some of the major environmental problems of the member countries of the UN Economic Commission for Europe. The Convention has 51 Parties and aims to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution including long-range transboundary air pollution. Which air pollutants are covered by the inventory? Under the LRTAP Convention, Parties (including the European Community) are requested to report emissions data for a number of important air pollutants, including sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), primary particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), heavy metals (HMs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). \u00a0 EU-27: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

Mining activities have considerable impacts on the environment, as materials are extracted directly from the ground in surface excavations, such as quarries or pits. More importantly, extraction of aggregates can substantially alter the landscape and affect groundwater reserves. There are also associated impacts in terms of energy use from the extraction and transportation of these materials. While the study acknowledges that there is potential to extend taxation in the area of natural resource management to other sectors, it also reflects that the four countries surveyed in the report have achieved mixed results. Italy and the Czech Republic showed weak evidence of improved landscape following the introduction of the tax, whereas Sweden has succeeded in reducing demand for natural gravel \u2014 an invaluable resource to guarantee groundwater quality. The report, presented today at the 16th annual conference of the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (EAERE) in Gothenburg, Sweden, also shows that taxes could encourage innovation and support research and development, in an attempt to balance economic growth with the protection of environment and health. The report states that adopting environmental taxation schemes is helping to improve the quality and reliability of extraction data, which can then be used to encourage changes in quarry management activities. In the United Kingdom, for example, the tax on raw construction materials gives the sector added confidence when purchasing materials, since part of the levy revenues have been used to support the development of quality standards for recycled aggregates. Taxes work better as part of a policy package Other concerns highlighted by the report Effectiveness of environmental taxes and charges for managing sand, gravel and rock extraction in selected EU countries include the need to avoid tax distortions across country borders. Coordination is imperative to prevent an overload of extraction in regions with lower or no tax schemes, underlines the study. Furthermore, taxes 'need to be used as part of a package of policies', the report says, to ensure more effective environmental improvements. In recent years, the EEA has published several reports assessing policy effectiveness and has become increasingly engaged in exploring the link between society's needs and the final impact of policies.

In addition, users can calculate the true emissions of CO2 and other pollutants in order to choose the greener alternative for an itinerary within Europe.

Electricity demand remained largely stable in households. Emissions from road transport continued to grow, releasing 6.5 million tonnes of CO2 or 0.7 % more than in 2005. The rise was mostly driven by increased use of diesel for freight and passenger transport. Emissions of greenhouse gases from international aviation and shipping activities continued to rise sharply in 2006. Contributions from these sectors, currently not included under the Kyoto Protocol, rose by nearly 5 million tonnes (aviation) and 10 million tonnes (international shipping). The Annual European Community Greenhouse gas inventory 1990\u20132006 and inventory report 2008 published today, also includes the following key findings: The net reduction in GHG emissions observed for EU-27 was mainly due to reduced emission of nitrous oxide (12 million tonnes CO2-equivalents) from chemical plants;Overall emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the most important greenhouse gas,\u00a0remained stable in the period 2005\u20132006;Heavier use of coal for power and heat production resulted in an increase of 15.4 million tonnes CO2 from this sector in 2006. Poland alone accounted for an increment of 7.6 million tonnes of emissions from this sector;Denmark and Finland experienced the biggest relative increase in GHG emissions (with 10.9 and 16.3 % respectively), due to heavier use of solid fossil fuels for power generation;EU-15 Member States cut emissions by 0.8 % (or 35 million tones) in 2006 and account for 81 % of the EU total. In 2006, EU-15 emissions were\u00a02.7 % below their levels in the base year (1990 in most cases). \u00a0 Table 1\u00a0 Greenhouse gas emissions in CO2-equivalents (excluding carbon sinks) and Kyoto Protocol targets for 2008\u20132012 \u00a0 (1) The base year under the Kyoto Protocol for each Member State and EU-15 is further outlined in Table 1.4 and 1.5 in the report. As Cyprus, Malta and EU-27 do not have targets under the Kyoto Protocol, they do not have applicable Kyoto Protocol base years. The new EEA GHG data viewer The European Environment Agency has developed a new greenhouse gas (GHG) data viewer which simplifies access and analysis of the data contained in the greenhouse gas inventory report. The GHG data viewer can show emission trends for the main sectors and allows for comparisons of emissions between different countries and activities. In addition, the web viewer can produce graphics and key emission estimates.

But how can we measure the extent of the loss and the threat it poses? Many European countries have developed, or are developing, their own indicators to measure changes in biodiversity in their territory. At the same time, progress is also being measured at the global level. Ensuring consistency between indicators at national, regional and global level is essential. The SEBI 2010 process brings together national administrations, NGOs and international organisations, and has compiled a first set of 26 indicators. Based on these indicators, an assessment report on Europe's progress towards the 2010 target will be published by the EEA in 2009. The award ceremony took place on Monday 16 June 2008 in Sevilla, Spain. What the SEBI 2010 indicators tell us Some well-monitored species, for example butterflies, are experiencing \u00a0a worrying decline. The European Butterfly Indicator for grassland butterflies shows a dramatic reduction of abundance by almost 50 % since 1990.Protected areas have been increasing, both in numbers and area. Almost one million square kilometres have been designated in 37 European countries.Europe consumes more than its land and water area can produce and produces more waste than its environment can absorb. SEBI 2010 background The SEBI 2010 process was started in 2005 to provide a streamlined set of biodiversity indicators for Europe. It tries to ensure consistency between biodiversity indicator sets at national and international levels without creating new monitoring or reporting obligations. SEBI 2010 relies on the contribution of more than 120 experts from across the pan-European region and from international intergovernmental organisations and NGOs. Its institutional partners are the European Environment Agency (and its European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity), the European Centre for Nature Conservation, UNEP's World Conservation Monitoring Centre, the European Commission, the Joint Secretariat of the Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy (PEBLDS), and the Czech Republic (as lead country for the Kiev Resolution action plan on biodiversity indicators).

We can no longer take these benefits for granted', says Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. 'Understanding the full value of what we keep losing is a precondition for halting biodiversity loss'. Biodiversity loss does not only mean loss of species, but also loss and degradation of ecosystem functions. Human impact can undermine or change the productivity of ecosystems, the way nutrients cycle within them, or alter the balance between different species groups, undermining the ecosystems' capacity to deliver services. Once we focus on the direct link between biodiversity and the benefits we derive from ecosystem services, the real costs of biodiversity loss to society become clear. Every week, implications of this loss, such as the rise in food prices, make the headlines. Several factors are at play: changing and rising demand across the world, reductions in food supply due to climate change as well as growing competition for agricultural land to be used for food, fuel, timber and housing. All of these factors put strains on ecosystem services. Linking society, economics and the environment Ecosystem accounts provide a single framework to link all the social, economic and environmental resources on which our well-being depends. Ultimately, they help us to understand the costs of such change, either in monetary terms or in terms of risks to human health or livelihood. As a contribution to the debate on the economics of biodiversity, the EEA is currently carrying out an extensive ecosystem accounts study on Mediterranean wetlands with the aim of showing the utility of this approach. A briefing, an executive summary and a poster highlighting first outcomes for selected sites such as the Camargue Delta (France), the Do\u00f1ana Park (Spain) or the Amvrakikos Bay (Greece), are presented today at a side event during COP 9 (the ninth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity) in Bonn, Germany. The study will be completed and published later in the year. Background information on the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity The importance of ecosystem services for human well-being was highlighted in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) in 2005, which reported that at global scales, 60\u00a0% of the services examined in the study (15 out of 24) are being degraded or used unsustainably. Human activity has been responsible for most of the damage\u00a0\u2014 largely through the effects it has had on the biodiversity and the integrity of ecological systems. These findings were at the heart of the policy discussions during the G8+5 Summit in May 2007, in Potsdam, Germany, where Heads of States asked for a comprehensive evaluation of the costs of biodiversity loss. Progress on this complex evaluation is presented today by an interim report on 'The economics of ecosystems and biodiversity' to the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Bonn, Germany.

A new EEA report points out the growing demand for forest resources, identifies major threats to the forest ecosystems across Europe and provides suggestions on how forest management could be improved to help halt loss of forest biological diversity.\u00a0 Although the European forest area is on the rise, in contrast to many other parts of the world, as much as 87\u00a0% of the total area covered by forests is subject to some degree of human intervention. Consequently, the way that forests are managed has a direct impact on biodiversity.\u00a0 Most European countries have appropriate legislative and administrative frameworks to ensure sustainable use of forests. However, Europe will need to continuously adapt its forest management to future climate change and other challenges. Arising challenges and the EEA's suggestions Production of wood and other traditional forest resources will have to be balanced against other kinds of goods and services from the forest ecosystems. This will require increased information on forest ecosystems and forest biodiversity. Demands on forests as a resource for bioenergy will grow. Any use of forests for bioenergy should not damage biological diversity and ecosystem conditions. Scattered or fragmented forest areas must be linked into habitat networks to protect biodiversity in forests. The Natura 2000 network is an essential component of the European Union's efforts in this field. Genetically modified trees may offer benefits as well as risks to biological diversity and humans. Europe must follow a precautionary approach towards genetically modified trees. Climate change will affect forest ecosystems and increase current threats to forests. Adaptation should ensure the connectivity of the forest landscape and protected forest areas to allow migration of species. Forests are significant carbon sinks, but measures developed to increase the carbon sequestration should not negatively impact forest biological diversity. Forest fires in the Mediterranean and other types of damage to forests need to be brought down. Long-range air pollution and nitrogen deposition are still significant problems.

These pollutants harm both human health and the environment by contributing to formation of ozone and particulate matter and leading to acidification and eutrophication. \u00a0The NEC Directive sets pollutant-specific and legally-binding emission ceilings (limits) for each country to be met by 2010. As was noted last year, the emission ceiling for NOx remains the most difficult for many MS to meet. Hungary, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom now indicate that they will not reach their NOx ceilings by 2010 on the basis of policy measures they have put in place to date. This means that 13 out of 27 Member States anticipate missing their NOx ceilings -unless they take further measures to reduce emissions. Five Member States (Denmark, France, Portugal, Spain and now also Poland) indicate they will miss their respective NMVOC ceilings; two countries their NH3 ceilings (Germany and Spain) and one, the Netherlands, its SO2 ceiling. Overall, 15 countries have now indicated they will miss at least one of the four emission ceilings. It is however noted that several Member States (Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands) reported data indicating that, by implementing additional measures, they could still reach their 2010 emissions ceilings. In addition, by 2010 a number of countries will have successfully reduced emissions of certain pollutants significantly beyond the levels required by the NEC Directive ceilings i.e. they will have over achieved compared to their original commitments for these pollutants. The data reported in 2007 includes for the first time data for the two new Member States, Bulgaria and Romania, which joined the European Union on 1 January 2007.

These costs are increasingly shaping the climate policy debate but the report highlights the fact that methodological issues and uncertainties remain in cost estimation. Based on a review of existing information, the report also analyses the economic costs of climate change at a sector level in Europe, considering natural ecosystems, coastal zones, agriculture, energy, tourism, human health, water availability and the built environment. Whilst detailed information is still limited, the report reveals that projected changes in climate are expected to have wide ranging impacts and economic effects. The overall net economic effects are still largely uncertain, however, there is a strong distributional pattern, with more adverse effects in the Mediterranean and south-eastern Europe.\u00a0 The study also concludes that adaptation has an extremely important role in reducing these economic costs. However, a review of EEA member countries shows that whilst almost all countries are making progress in terms of recognizing the importance of adaptation, only a handful are progressing an economic perspective. It is crucial that countries begin to exchange information, share experience and learn lessons from each other, the report says. A major element of the report is a review of the main methodological issues in estimating the costs of inaction and the costs of adaptation. The study shows that the evidence and understanding of the costs of inaction are still incomplete. Different assumptions and choices in the methodology lead to a very wide range of estimates. A number of challenges and research needs are identified which should be addressed in order to improve our understanding of the economic costs of climate change. Ultimately, the report calls for improved information on climate change impacts and adaptation strategies, and recommends greater information sharing among EEA member countries.

A three degrees rise in summer could lead to a loss of about 80 % of the alpine glaciers. Snow and glaciers are important for the availability of water, especially in summer when the water retained gradually melts. Reduced run-off will reduce water supplies for Europeans living in catchment areas of, for example, the Alps or the Pyrenees and affect agriculture, industry and power generation. Winter tourism generates huge amounts of revenue for Europe's economy. For example, it makes up 4.5 % of Austria's GDP. As most ski resorts rely on stable snow conditions, they are likely to be hit by higher winter temperatures. Melting of snow and ice in remote areas like the Arctic will also affect Europe. As the white surfaces are replaced by darker ones, more heat from the sun will be absorbed. Also, there is more organic carbon and methane stored in the Arctic permafrost than in the atmosphere. Consequently, thawing of the permafrost will release these greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Thus, the effects in the Arctic will accelerate global warming. Lower lying regions may be severely affected by the rise in the sea level. In European coastal zones, we find 16 % of the continent's inhabitants and 280 cities with more than 50 000 people. Sea level now rises 3 mm/year and is projected to continue to rise due to past emissions of greenhouse gases. However, the long-term effect of the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica remains largely uncertain. If emissions continue to grow, the melting of these ice sheets could lead to the sea level rising by metres over the next centuries, even with only a partial melt down. The EU has proposed to limit the global warming to two degrees over pre-industrial time to avoid such adverse effects. This will require substantial reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases. However, some effects are unavoidable. Therefore, adaptation measures are needed in vulnerable sectors and regions. The EU Commission will publish a Green Paper on adaptation to climate change in July this year.

Many species are already on the move, expanding northwards as temperatures rise,' says Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. The impact of climate change on biodiversity varies extensively from region to region. The most sensitive natural ecosystems in Europe are found in mountain regions, coastal zones (the Baltic wetlands, in particular), the Arctic and in various parts of the Mediterranean. Many species and ecosystems in these regions are likely to have difficulty in adapting to climate change. 'Europe's landscape is already experiencing massive change at our hands as we build on and develop our land resources at a rapid rate. Between 1990 and 2000, more than 800 000 hectares, of Europe's land was built on. That is an area three times the size of Luxembourg. Combine this development with the impacts of climate change and it\u2019s not difficult to imagine the pressure that our future environment will be under,' Professor McGlade said. The EU has proposed to limit global warming to no more than 2 \u00b0C above the pre-industrial level, since there is strong scientific evidence that a temperature rise beyond this threshold would greatly increase the damage to natural systems not to mention human society. Substantial global greenhouse gas emission reductions are needed to achieve this target. However, even with a global temperature increase limited to 2 \u00b0C adaptation will still be required in many affected sectors. Climate change is very likely to alter conditions of suitability for many species in current conservation areas. This poses a major challenge for conservation, because current conservation policy is underpinned by the idea of static species ranges. The ability of countries to meet the requirements of EU Directives and other international conventions is likely to be compromised by climate change, and a more dynamic strategy for conservation is needed for sustaining biodiversity (IPCC 2007). This has important consequences for the successful implementation of the Natura 2000 network which covers over 18 % of the EU-25's terrestrial area. Towards boosting nature's adaptation capacity, the recent Commission's Biodiversity Communication calls for the strengthening of the coherence, connectivity and resilience of the EU's network of protected areas. Specific measures to help the most at-risk habitats and species to adapt are also called for. Furthermore, the Commission is planning to publish a Green Paper on adaptation to climate change in Europe covering all sectors that are affected by climate change in June 2007.

Professor Jacqueline McGlade The IPCC report, 'Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability', is the second of three major reports planned by the UN panel of international scientists. The report says climate change is already affecting the global environment and that drought, flooding and changes to seasonal patterns will increase as global temperatures increase. However, the extent of the impacts will be closely linked to the increase in temperature. The report underlines the fact that many of the most vulnerable regions are in developing countries in Africa, Asia as well as island communities around the globe. However, the entire global community will be affected. As a result, effective adaptation measures must be coordinated, according to Professor McGlade. 'The trans-boundary nature of climate change means that successful adaptation strategies will take time and will require coordination at local, national, regional, and international levels,' she said. Professor McGlade stressed, however, that the focus must still remain on controlling and reducing increases to the global climate as a first priority. 'We can delay and reduce some of the effects of climate change by cutting emissions of greenhouse gases \u2014 the drivers of global temperature increases. However, real cuts must start now as there will be a lag time before reductions have a positive effect. Failure to do so could lead to major adverse, possibly irreversible impacts that are beyond the capacity of many regions to adapt to,' she said. The IPCC report presents observed and projected changes that include: Increasing global ice melt leading to enlargement and increased numbers of glacial lakes, with increased risk of outburst floods Increasing ground instability due to thawing in high-Alpine mountain and other permafrost regions Growing risk of ice and rock avalanches in mountain regions Enhanced run-off and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow-fed rivers Lake and river warming \u2014 affecting thermal structure and water quality Earlier spring events: leaf unfolding, bird migration and egg-laying, for example: Shifting ranges of plant and animal species Changing Arctic and Antarctic flora and fauna with far-reaching disruptions of the food chain. The IPCC report also shows that some adaptation is already occurring. However, more extensive adaptation is required in vulnerable regions and sectors (such as water resource management; human health; agriculture; building sector).

The study projects a significant decrease by 2020 in net greenhouse gas emissions from municipal waste, with a reduction of more than 80 % (down to 10 million tones) compared to the late 1980s. The reduction will be driven by greater recycling volumes, increased amounts of waste recovery and incineration combined with energy production. Europe\u2019s success in diverting waste away from landfill is also considered a key factor bringing down emissions. Municipal waste, however, is set to grow by 25 % from 2005 to 2020. The EEA warns that increasing waste amounts could lead to saturation and increase GHG emissions due to inefficient management. Keeping municipal waste to the minimum remains the preferred action for reinforcing past and future improvements in waste treatment. Decreasing current amounts could turn this sector into a sink, reducing total net GHG emissions. Restricting waste volumes delivers both immediate and long-term benefits to citizens, including reduced air pollution (with particles and nitrogen oxides) and less noise from collection and transport. In 2005 emissions from waste management represented 2 % of EU's total GHG output. Methane, one of the six greenhouse gases controlled by the Kyoto protocol, is mostly generated by landfill operations in the waste sector. Landfill is considered the worst option for disposal, with harmful effects on the environment and health. Incineration, on the other hand, could contribute positively if combined with high rates of energy recovery and strict emission controls, while recycling remains one of the priorities for waste management. These conclusions are the result of an integrated analysis addressing, for the first time, the effects of municipal waste management on the net emissions of GHGs across Europe. The EEA and the European Topic Centre for Resource and Waste Management have used an EU-wide economic model for projecting waste volumes to 2020, combining analysis of recycling, incineration and landfill management with relevant legislation and life-cycle information for calculating GHG emissions. The EEA analysis aims to provide useful information in view of the current revision of the EU Waste Framework Directive.

It represents a decrease over only one year and may not be representative of the trend over a longer period Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA The EEA has taken the decision to release the main messages of the report early because of growing public and political interest in the issue of climate change. The key points of the report are: EU-15: Emissions of GHGs decreased by 0.8 % between 2004 and 2005. EU-15: Emissions of GHGs decreased by 1.5 % compared to 1990. EU-27: Emissions of GHGs decreased by 8 % compared to 1990 levels. Which sectors are mainly responsible for the GHG cuts? In absolute terms, the main sectors contributing to emissions reductions between 2004 and 2005 in the EU-15 were public electricity and heat production, households and services, and road transport. Emissions from public electricity and heat production decreased mainly due to a reduction in the reliance on coal. The reduced emissions from households and services have to be further analysed, but appear to be due to climatic conditions. The decrease in emissions from road transport has also to be further analysed, but appears to be a combination of reduced fuel consumption and increased use of diesel cars. Which countries show the biggest decreases in GHG emissions? Germany, Finland and the Netherlands contributed most to the EU-15 reduction. Germany: a shift from coal to gas in the production of public electricity and heat was one of the main reasons for the decrease in emissions. In addition, emissions from road transport and from households and services declined substantially. Finland: emission reductions were mainly due to a substantial decrease in the use of fossil fuels in the production of public electricity and heat. Coal use, in particular, decreased. The Netherlands: less fossil fuel was used for the production of public electricity and heat. Notes: What is the annual GHG inventory report? The EEA compiles this report annually using information reported by national governments under the EC GHG Monitoring Mechanism. The report contains domestic GHG emissions data from 1990 to 2005 for the EU-15 and the EU-27. Domestic, in this context, refers to emissions from within each Member State, which are then added up to give an EU total. The data may be subject to change up to May 2007 as a result of initial checks by the UNFCCC secretariat and updates by EU Member States, however, the main trends outlined will not change. What is the significance of this report in the context of the Kyoto Protocol? Official reporting of emissions for compliance purposes under the Kyoto Protocol does not begin until 2010 \u2013 when emissions will be reported for 2008. In the meantime, this report is the most accurate inventory of greenhouse gas emissions for the EU and can be used to track progress towards Kyoto targets. The EU-15 has a common target to reduce GHG emissions by 8 %, compared to the base year* using domestic reductions (cutting emissions from each Member State) as well as Kyoto mechanisms (EU Member States invest in emissions reductions initiatives outside the EU in return for credits). This inventory report suggests that domestic emissions of GHGs decreased by approximately 1.9 % compared to the base year under the Kyoto Protocol. (*The base year for most greenhouse gases under the Kyoto Protocol is 1990 for the EU-15, but some Member States use 1995 as the base year for fluorinated or 'F-gases', one of the so-called greenhouse gases) When will the final GHG inventory report be published? The EEA will not publish more information on the EU GHG emissions situation until mid-June, 2007.

The cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the worst impacts of climate change can be limited to around 1% of global GDP each year with effective, immediate action. The EEA supports Stern\u2019s view that action on climate change will not only cost but will also create significant business opportunities, as new markets are created in low-carbon energy technologies and other low-carbon goods and services. The EEA also supports the Stern report views that: Three policy elements are required for an effective global response: The pricing of carbon, implemented through tax, trading or regulation Policy to support innovation and the deployment of low-carbon technologies Action removing barriers to energy efficiency An international consensus on long-term goals and a global framework for action is also needed. Such a framework should include: widespread emissions trading, more investment and cooperation in research and development, action to reduce deforestation and measures to support adaptation.

The committee is composed of 20 independent scientists from 15 EEA member countries, covering a variety of environmental fields relevant for the Agency's areas of activity.\u00a0 Opinion of the EEA Scientific Committee on the environmental impacts of biofuel utilisation in the EU\u00a0 Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector are rising steadily, caused by the continuing growth of transport volume. More than 90\u00a0% of the total transport emissions are due to road transport. Policies and measures have so far not been sufficient to stop further emission growth. Owing to the increasing urgency of these problems, mandatory biofuel quotas have been introduced in the expectation that in the medium term the growth in transport emissions can be reduced and that the emissions can be subsequently stabilised. In 2003, the Biofuels Directive set the objective of replacing 2\u00a0% of vehicle fuel supply by 2005 and 5.75\u00a0% by 2010. The 2005 target was not met and it seems unlikely that the 2010 target can be reached. Nevertheless in 2007 the EU target for biofuels was increased to an ambitious 10\u00a0% level by 2020, under the conditions of production being sustainable and second generation technologies being commercially available. Despite the fact that the first targets were missed, the pace of biofuel production in the EU and of biofuel imports from third countries is picking up. This gives rise to increasing concern by the Scientific Committee regarding additional environmental pressures inside and outside the EU. Our concerns can be summarised as follows: \u2022 Biofuel production based on first generation technologies does not optimally use biomass resources with regard to fossil energy saving and to greenhouse gas reduction. Technologies for direct heat and electricity generation should be preferred because they are more economically competitive and more environmentally effective than biofuel production for vehicles. \u2022 Biomass utilisation implies combustion of very valuable and finite resources from our living environment. These resources ought to be preserved wherever possible. Therefore biomass utilisation must necessarily go hand in hand with energy efficiency improvements. This is not yet the case for the majority of applications in the automotive and residential sectors. \u2022 The EEA has estimated the amount of available arable land for bioenergy production without harming the environment in the EU (EEA Report No 7/2006). In the view of the EEA Scientific Committee the land required to meet the 10\u00a0% target exceeds this available land area even if a considerable contribution of second generation fuels is assumed. The consequences of the intensification of biofuel production are thus increasing pressures on soil, water and biodiversity. \u2022 The 10\u00a0% target will require large amounts of additional imports of biofuels. The accelerated destruction of rain forests due to increasing biofuel production can already be witnessed in some developing countries. Sustainable production outside Europe is difficult to achieve and to monitor. The overambitious 10\u00a0% biofuel target is an experiment, whose unintended effects are difficult to predict and difficult to control. Therefore the Scientific Committee recommends suspending the 10\u00a0% goal; carrying out a new, comprehensive scientific study on the environmental risks and benefits of biofuels; and setting a new and more moderate long-term target, if sustainability cannot be guaranteed.

For example, the German environmental portal \"PortalU\" brings together data from several several hundred thousand webpages and more than 120 public agencies. Italy is developing an environmental information and monitoring system (EIMS Italy). Such initiatives will be the building blocks of SEIS, which will ensure that policy makers and citizens alike can easily find and access the latest data available through not only the European Environment Agency (EEA) portal but also national portals. A portal for sharing ozone information is already in place. High concentration of ozone at ground level is a health hazard. It can cause breathing difficulties and damage lungs, especially in children and people with asthma or other respiratory illnesses. Every hour, the EEA receives ozone data from some 700 measurement stations across Europe. Within hours this information is presented online in form of maps (Ozone live map). Why do we need to know?

The proposed package, including effort sharing amongst EU Member States, is an important step in the context of the post-2012 global climate change negotiations EEA Executive Director Prof. Jacqueline McGlade 'The rapid response of the Commission to the decision of last March's European Council shows a clear determination to sharply reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by at least 20 % between 1990 and 2020. The proposed package, including effort sharing amongst EU Member States, is an important step in the context of the post-2012 global climate change negotiations'. These discussions are expected to conclude in Copenhagen by the end of 2009. The Climate action and renewable energy package is a bundle of legislative proposals intended to fight global warming and limit the increased dependence of the European Union on imported energy. The package addresses renewable energies, including biofuels; how the overall EU greenhouse gas target will be shared between Member States; a revision of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), and a directive proposal on how to implement carbon capture and storage at power generation plants. The EEA strongly supports the proposal for an overall binding target of a 20 % share of renewable energy in the total final energy consumption in the EU, recognising that a significant increase compared to the current level is needed to achieve the 2020 climate objectives, while, at the same time, contributing to enhance the security of energy supply in Europe. 'The key to getting the most out of these targets is to ensure that the highest possible GHG emission reduction is achieved, particularly if we want to see 10 % of road transport running on biofuels by 2020. I believe that there is now a need for further discussion on the sustainability criteria for biofuels in the legislative proposal. These criteria must ensure that biodiversity, water and soil are protected, and not just within Europe, but also in developing countries which are likely to become major biofuels exporters.' The Commission package improves the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), the largest GHG emission trading scheme worldwide. This system is a pioneer tool to achieve carbon emission reductions from large installations using fossil fuel. Further efforts to link the EU ETS to other similar trading systems in third countries also contribute to worldwide greenhouse gas reduction measures. 'Setting an EU-wide cap on emissions from the trading sector and an increased use of auctioning of carbon allowances can help meet the 2020 emission reduction targets in a cost-effective way'. Professor McGlade confirms that climate change adaptation and mitigation are top priorities for the EEA. She underlines that decision makers will continue to get timely and accurate information on these important issues.

These pollutants can harm human health and the environment. The NEC Directive sets pollutant-specific and legally-binding emission ceilings (targets) for each country to be met by 2010. It also lays down the requirements for the Member States to annually report their latest air emission data and their projected emission estimates for the year 2010. Each year the EEA publishes a summary of this information. The most recent data shows that only 11 Member States (Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovak Republic and the United Kingdom) presently expect to meet their respective national ceilings defined in the Directive. The remaining thirteen Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden) project to miss ceilings for at least one of the four pollutants if additional actions to reduce emissions are not taken. Seven of the latter countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Malta, Slovenia, and Sweden) are considering implementing 'additional' actions in order to meet the 2010 targets.

Man-made emissions of all air pollutants fell substantially in the 32 EEA member countries the report says. This was mainly due to the effectiveness of EU policies limiting air pollution from the power/heat generation sector, industry and from road transport. However, measured concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and ozone, have not generally shown any improvement since 1997. Particulate matter Particulate matter is an umbrella term for a 'basket' of potentially harmful chemical components that form particles in the air including: organic chemicals, acid aerosols, trace metals, sea salts and windborne soil dust.\u00a0Because of their small size the particles are easily inhaled by humans and have a damaging effect on health. Exposure to PM can shorten life expectancy and increase the numbers of premature deaths, hospital admissions and emergency room visits (e.g. respiratory diseases, increased risk of heart attack). Fine particulate matter, with a diameter size below 2.5 micrometer (PM2.5), is now generally recognised to be the main threat to human health from air pollution. Ozone Ozone (O3) is formed in the ground-level atmosphere by reaction between NOX and volatile organic compounds in the presence of heat and sunlight. Ozone pollution is thus a major concern during the summer months. If inhaled by humans, ozone can be harmful to the upper respiratory tract and the lungs. Possible causes of high PM and ozone levels High PM and ozone levels in the air, as observed in 2003, can also partly be explained by weather conditions, the report says. Reduced precipitation, high springtime temperatures and stable atmospheric conditions (all conditions which occurred in 2003) lead to higher pollutant concentrations in the air. Other causes of this phenomenon could include additional pollution coming from natural sources and pollution transported from countries outside Europe, the report says. Key points of the report Estimates indicate that up to 43 % of the European urban population were exposed to PM10 concentrations in excess of the EU air quality limit value between 1990\u20132004. The worst affected areas were Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary as well as in the Po Valley in Italy and southern Spain. Up to 60 % of the European urban population was exposed to ozone concentrations in excess of the EU air quality limit values between 1990\u20132004. Exposure of crops and forests to ozone exceeded limit/critical values over very large areas of central and southern Europe. Human exposure to certain other potentially harmful air pollutants, sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and lead, has decreased markedly due to effective European air quality policies. This is particularly true with policies reducing emissions of SO2 from power and heat generation as well as CO and lead emissions from passenger cars.

Shedding light on this, the EEA and its Topic Centre have developed a set of country factsheets containing information about national waste management within the EU-25. The fact sheets provide insights about: national legislative frameworks on waste types of policy instruments being used data on waste policies for reducing waste generation and shifting waste management away from landfill The factsheets show that three groupings of countries exist with similar systems and levels of recycling, incineration and landfill in Europe (see \u2014 below). Success criteria for diverting waste from landfill seem to be combinations of landfill bans, landfill taxes and separate collection schemes in those countries with high material recovery and incineration with energy recovery. Three country groupings defined by waste diversion strategy EU-level waste legislation is instrumental in determining the overall objectives, but country-level implementation determines the waste management strategy. To gain insights into whether a strategic shift in broader waste management has occurred, and why, the EEA is currently analysing the approaches and combinations of policy instruments that countries are taking in the management of their municipal waste, particularly in the context of the Landfill Directive.

The report was launched at the Sixth Ministerial Conference 'Environment for Europe' taking place in Belgrade. 'The economic restructuring in these regions offers a unique opportunity to 'leapfrog' towards more sustainable production patterns and also to guide consumption patterns towards sustainability before consumption reaches the levels observed in Western Europe' said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. The report provides detailed analysis in selected economic sectors: industry, food, building, transport and waste. The analysis is illustrated with examples of implementation of sustainable consumption and production (SCP) initiatives at the local level, through 18 city studies commissioned specifically for this report. Many SEE and EECCA countries face similar problems and there is huge potential to share knowledge and experiences and work towards a common path to sustainability. Cities have acted as potential catalysts for change as shown by a large number of local sustainability initiatives. These need support from national policy, if they are to spread throughout the region. Elements left-over from the past have the potential to support more sustainable production and consumption patterns in some of the countries studied. These include: widespread existence of district heating systems, railway infrastructure, and operational reuse and recycling systems; tradition of using public transport, low car ownership and extensive collective transport networks; various business opportunities exist for more sustainable practices, such as organic farming or improvement of energy efficiency of buildings. However, rapid economic growth since the beginning of the decade presents potential environmental challenges as consumption and production increase, the report says. 'Policy effort should not only focus on the technical 'fix'. Experience from western countries shows that technological improvements and efficiency gains are not sufficient on their own. They must be supported by measures, both economic and information based, aimed at influencing consumer behaviour. Without this, technological and efficiency gains risk being undermined by the \u2018rebound effect\u2019 where increased consumption resulting from reduced prices cancels out technological gains,' Professor McGlade said.

'Information on environmental technology is now widely needed to help policy-makers, companies and citizens determine how to best tackle some of our key environmental problems. Whilst it exists, much of the information is dispersed at national levels and not easy to find. Given the Agency's working remit as a European environmental information provider, this was a critical gap that we needed to help fill.' said EEA executive director Jacqueline McGlade. The web-based atlas covers knowledge centres, major technology installations and private companies all over Europe. It has been developed in coordination with the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety. The environmental technology atlas reflects the technology areas referred to in the German presidency position paper 'A new quality of life: a New Deal for economy, environment, and employment', namely: energy generation and power stations, energy efficiency, recycling and waste management, mobility and transport, water and wastewater, environmental engineering/systems engineering, life sciences and nanotechnology. The European companies listed in the atlas deal with either pollution management, resource management, integrated activities or monitoring. As the name suggests, the environmental technology atlas is a map-based tool. The user is presented with a European map and can zoom quickly into the geographical area of interest. This feature is further enhanced through the integration of the atlas with Google Earth, enabling the chosen locations to be shown on top of a satellite image of the area. Searches can also be more highly specified by using thematic filters and keywords, allowing the user for instance to search solely for private companies engaged in waste management technology in Germany and France. Data has been collected from a wide range of national business directories, yellow pages, and Chamber of Commerce member lists. What is launched in Essen is primarily the new tool. While there are already several thousand data entries included at the time of start-up, much of the further population of the atlas is to be a bottom-up process: the atlas offers businesses and organisations free of charge listing \u2014 which they can do online by filling in a simple form.

Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA Professor McGlade was speaking after the launch of 'Mitigation of Climate Change', the third in a series of reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report, written by a panel of international scientists on behalf of the UN, focuses on measures to counter climate change. 'We have seen the cost of inaction in terms of people's lives and our environment in the past with examples such as the collapse of fish stocks, the use of asbestos in buildings, acid rain and lead in petrol. It pays to act now to secure the long term', she said. The IPCC report stresses the urgency of the situation, estimating that there are only two decades to implement effective greenhouse gas reduction measures to control and limit global temperature increases. The largest emission reduction potential is in increased energy efficiency in electricity and heat generation, in building insulation and by substantially expanding renewable energy. Investments in energy supply in developing countries, modernisation of energy infrastructure in developed countries and policies to increase energy security create opportunities to achieve emission reductions, the report says. Technology, existing as well as new innovations, will also have a key role to play, according to the IPCC. However, these technologies will only thrive if appropriate incentives are created and investments in research and development are increased. 'We need to create the right economic environment with the necessary incentives leading to more investment in competitive, environmentally friendly technologies. We have already seen this approach working. For example, strong taxation of petrol in Europe and high regulatory standards led to cars that have been almost twice as fuel efficient as cars on America's roads, in recent decades', Professor McGlade said. The IPCC report also stresses the need to establish an effective, global emissions trading scheme, which would set a realistic price on CO2 emissions. This will also help create incentives for producers and consumers to invest in products, technologies and processes with low or zero emissions. A broad range of instruments\u00a0\u2014 standards, taxes, charges, tradable emissions permits, voluntary agreements\u00a0\u2014 are available to establish markets for low CO2\u00a0 or zero emission technologies, according to the report. 'The EEA has long advocated a gradual shift away from taxes on labour and investment towards taxes on pollution and the inefficient use of materials and land. We also need reforms in the way that subsidies are applied to transport, housing, energy and agriculture. We need subsidies encouraging sustainable practices and efficient technologies', Professor McGlade said.

The way we perceive landscapes, the attraction we feel to some of them, and our feelings when conflicts arise over the use of land, are all matters of extreme importance for conservation and future human welfare. A landscape is essentially a photograph of what is going on; it reveals, in short, who we are. At the same time landscapes are also dynamic expressions of continually changing natural processes (climatic, physical, biological) and changes caused by human activity. Landscape analysis requires the consideration of different factors not equally easy to apply. The spatial dimension must be considered, as must the temporal component. It is especially important to know both where and when change is happening, given the uneven distribution and value of ecological goods and services across Europe, the vast range of activities that impact on them and the changing character and intensity of these impacts over time. Land and Ecosystem Accounting (LEAC) is a powerful tool that helps us to better understand and protect the environment. Land and ecosystem accounts are systemic descriptions of how related assets change over time and space (where an asset is anything valuable or useful). It works by providing a single overview where the social, economic and environmental resources on which our wellbeing depends can be linked within a single framework. \u201cLand and Ecosystem Accounting provides the overview that we need to better protect and maintain our natural capital; both now and into the future\u201d, said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA.

However, today, even where there is little or no population pressure, a variety of factors are still driving urban sprawl.

France, Italy and the United Kingdom showed the most significant emission cuts in this sector. Milder winters are likely to have led to lower energy consumption in homes. On the other hand, CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production increased by 14.0 million tonnes in EU-27. The recent downward trend shown by EU-27 was offset by\u00a0a major revision of the 1990 emission data. As a result, this year's report shows that EU-27 recorded 0.5 percentage points less progress compared to 1990, although total GHG emissions have clearly decreased. Some Member States and the EU are therefore obliged to intensify efforts to cut climate-changing gas emissions. The EEA will present a more detailed analysis\u00a0\u2014 based on the consolidated numbers\u00a0\u2014 in June 2008.

The upcoming EU Action Plan on Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) \u2014 possibly combined with an Action Plan on Sustainable Industrial Policies \u2014 should include 'clear sustainability targets' according to the recommendations developed by the participants of the conference. Concrete steps to get the prices right and a directive on green public procurement were additional top-priority recommendations identified by the experts ahead of the EU Action Plan. Internalising costs through environmental fiscal reforms, identifying models and examples of sustainable living and developing long term visions of sustainable consumption and production were the top-priority recommendations identified for national authorities, in cooperation with business and civil society. At the global level, participants advocated for the United Nations within its Marrakech Process (1) to encourage national governments to integrate sustainable consumption and production objectives into ministries beyond environment. The conference also singled out the need to develop a world-wide communication strategy to promote sustainable consumption and production and to involve also private financial institutions. The EEA is already making its contribution: responding to the recommendations, the Agency is for example assessing worldwide impacts from consumption in Europe through integrated economic and environmental accounting, identifying indicators of sustainable consumption and production, and analysing the factors driving consumption change.

The study Climate for a transport change urges policy-makers to set challenging, but realistic targets for this sector, while addressing transport demand 'in a serious and unbiased way'. 'I am convinced that we can limit the spiralling growth of emissions from the transport sector', says Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. 'The unrestrained growth of transport activities creates too many side-effects which concern us all, such as noise and air pollution. It is also inflicting severe damage upon Europe\u2019s biodiversity.' 'EU transport policy must act upon this growth of emissions', says Professor McGlade. 'If transport, and particularly road transport, had followed the trends of other economic sectors, we could have shown international leadership by having reached our greenhouse gas emission targets under the Kyoto Protocol several years ago.' The report, presented today in Brussels to the European Parliaments\u2019 Committee on Climate Change goes well beyond the provision of emissions data from the transport sector and urges integration of land use and transport in urban planning. Across the EU-15, cities account for roughly 80 % of traffic congestion costs, including loss of working hours. 'Transport has been a free-rider for too long when it comes to the fight against global warming and carbon emissions. Governments and citizens need to rethink radically their approach to transport policy \u2014 if nothing else, out of self-concern in protecting their health. We cannot continue to give privileges to less efficient transport modes', says Professor McGlade. This EU-wide study reveals that voluntary commitments by car manufacturers to improve efficiency in vehicles have not resulted in sufficient gains. In addition, the occupancy rates of private vehicles have gradually been going down. Approximately 12 % of the overall EU emissions of CO2 come from fuel burnt by passenger cars. International aviation and maritime transport activities are not included in the Kyoto protocol commitments, in part because of the difficulties to allocate emissions to a specific country.

Energy crops are expected to use more of Europe's farmlands over the years to come and environmental limits will be needed to avoid damaging impacts on the environment overall. Soaring energy prices and strong political support are driving the increase in production of biomass. This should not contribute to further ecological strains -already arising from current agricultural production, says the study. The report analyses the 'environmentally compatible' potential of biomass production in 25 EU Member States and warns that Europe's biodiversity, waters and soils could be threatened unless significant protective measures are put in place. The EEA report presents a range of recommendations for making energy cropping compatible with the environment, including: Devoting at least 30 % of agricultural land area to 'environmentally orientated' farming. A large number of Member States are already on track to achieve the minimum share by combining organic farming and High Nature Value farmland, particularly in Southern and Eastern Europe.At least 3 % of intensively cultivated land should be set aside as ecological compensation areas. This measure could halt the loss of bird populations by providing non-cropped habitats and maintain links between zones covered by European ecological networks such as Natura 2000.Certain types of extensive farming, such as permanent grassland, dehesas and traditional olive groves, should not be converted to arable energy crops. The report also promotes some general approaches to minimise the impact of biomass production on Europe's environment. For example, new crops 'should not require irrigation, intensive pesticide and fertilizer use' and should not be grown in monoculture, supporting farmland diversity. The report reviews specific policy mechanisms for encouraging environmentally sound bioenergy cropping. These include rules for energy cropping practices, incentives for environmentally friendly energy crops and advice to farmers. Policy efforts will be required to ensure that food, feed and biomass production in agriculture become environmentally compatible.

As a result, the full cost of producing and consuming goods and services is not reflected in their ultimate market price. These ignored costs should be added to the current production output and imports of countries, sectors and companies enabling us to calculate the full cost of goods and services (FCGS), she said. These two additional measures could be a valuable tool for policy-makers, enabling them to take more informed decisions on the costs of action versus inaction, on environmental costs and where to target ecological tax reform.

EEA Executive Director Prof. Jacqueline McGlade The report, 'Greenhouse gas emission trends and projections in Europe 2007', presents an evaluation of data between 1990 and 2005. More importantly, the report evaluates Member State projections of future greenhouse gas emissions and provides a good indication of progress towards Kyoto targets. The report is of particular relevance in the context of the rapidly approaching 'first commitment period' of the Kyoto Protocol which runs from 2008 to 2012 (1). (See notes) EU-15 Emissions in 2005: According to the new report: EU-15 emissions decreased by 0.8 % between 2004 and 2005 EU-15 emissions reached a level 2 % below the Kyoto base year (2) 'On New Year's Day 2008 the serious business of Kyoto begins for real. All available measures should now be implemented. Significant emission reductions will take place through the emissions trading scheme, the EU's 'cap and trade' programme for carbon (3). As the scheme matures and expands we will see it establishing itself as a blueprint for a global carbon market \u2014 an important part of any post-Kyoto agreement,' said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. Within the shared Kyoto target, each EU-15 Member State has a differentiated emissions target, which can be achieved by a variety of means. The 12 new EU Member States are not part of the joint EU-15 target but all, except Cyprus and Malta, have individual targets under the Kyoto Protocol. Looking ahead \u2014 the Road to Kyoto: Based on Member State projections, the report says that existing domestic policies and measures (4) will reduce EU-15 greenhouse gas emissions by a net effect of 4.0 % below base-year levels. When additional domestic policies and measures (i.e. those planned but not yet implemented) are taken into account, the EU-15 could reduce emissions by an additional 3.9 %. The projected use of Kyoto mechanisms (5) by ten of the EU-15 will reduce emissions by a further 2.5 %. These governments have set aside EUR 2.9 billion to pay for this. The use of carbon sinks, such as planting forests to remove CO2, will reduce emissions by an additional 0.9 %. As a result, the EU could even achieve an 11.4 % reduction, the report says. All new Member States with a target expect to meet their target. Key instrument: The EU emissions trading scheme will bring significant emission reductions between 2008 and 2012, according to the report. It is expected to contribute a reduction of at least 3.4 %, part of which is already reflected in some Member States projections. This would represent a further reduction of at least 1.3 % to the total of 11.4 % from base-year emissions in the EU-15. Notes to the editor: Background to the report The report, prepared by the EEA and its European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change (ETC/ACC), complements the annual evaluation report of the European Commission to the Council and European Parliament. For more information see the Commission website. The EEA report covers 33 countries including: EU-15 Member States: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom. New Member States: Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia. Acceding countries: Croatia, Turkey. Other EEA member countries: Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, Switzerland. An individual annex is provided for each country covered by the report. Data source: The report is based on data and information submitted by the countries to the European Commission and the EEA by 1 June 2007. For the past trends, it is entirely based on EEA Technical report No 7/2007 Annual European Community greenhouse gas inventory 1990-2005 and inventory report 2007. See press release (15 June 2007). EU Kyoto Targets: The EU-15 has a Kyoto target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 8 % from base-year levels (see below) by 2012. Within this overall target, each EU-15 member state has a differentiated reduction target; some should reduce emissions while others are allowed a limited increase. New Member States have individual targets except Cyprus and Malta, which have no targets. Countries can achieve these targets by a variety of means. Base-year emissions: Under the Kyoto Protocol the GHG emission level in the 'base year' is the relevant starting point for tracking progress of domestic emissions for EU-15 and all Member States which have a Kyoto target. The EU-27 does not have a Kyoto target and an aggregated base year for the EU-27 is therefore not applicable in any discussion of progress towards Kyoto targets. The base year is not a 'year' per se, but the emission level from which emission reductions will take place. For carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide 1990 is used as the 'base year' for all EU-15 Member States. But for fluorinated gases, the EU-15 Member States can choose to use the emission levels in 1995 instead. Twelve of the 15 Member States have chosen to use 1995 as their base year for fluorinated gas emissions. In practice, EU-15 base-year emissions can be considered close to 1990 emissions. EU Emissions Trading Scheme: The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is the European Union's climate change policy tool, which helps industries to cut their CO2 emissions in a cost-effective way. It requires a cap on emissions for all large CO2 emission sources. In the EU-15, the ETS is estimated to cut 3.4 % from base-year emissions. Domestic policies and measures: Domestic policies and measures take place within the national boundaries of the country and include: the promotion of electricity from renewable energy; improvements in energy efficiency; promotion of biofuels in transport; reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from cars; recovery of gases from landfills and reduction of fluorinated gases. Kyoto Mechanisms: The Kyoto Mechanisms help developed countries to achieve their Kyoto targets by gaining credits through carbon cutting activities in other countries. They also help the transfer of low-carbon technologies to other countries. The projected use of Kyoto mechanisms by ten of the EU-15 Member States will reduce emissions by 2010 by 2.5 % from base-year levels. These countries are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. For more information on Kyoto mechanisms see the UNFCCC website. Overview of progress for EU Member States and other EEA member countries Notes: National projections provided by 1 June 2007 have been taken into account in this report. Projected net removal from carbon sink activities (land-use change and forestry). Denmark projects it will reach its target by initiating new national climate initiatives, although these have not yet been identified. In July 2007, Spain adopted a Plan of Urgent Measures against Climate Change. Spain plans that these measures will allow it to fulfil its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.

EEA Executive Director Prof. Jacqueline McGlade The report, the fourth in a series this year, was presented in Valencia, Spain after a week of intense negotiations. It pulls no punches in terms of the possibly catastrophic impacts of climate change, underlining in particular the impacts on poorer nations, who are wholly unprepared. 'While the worst effects of climate change may not hit for many years we must prepare now. Climate change will have profound effects on our natural resources and will also change the way we go about our daily lives. We will not only lose biodiversity but also large parts of our territory, for example low-lying coastal areas and river basins as sea levels rise and the number of river floods increase,' Professor McGlade said. This report provides an integrated view of climate change, its causes, its effects, as well as adaptation and mitigation options, focusing on issues particularly relevant for policymakers. The report provides a more systematic understanding of the timing and magnitude of the impacts of climate change and clearly points out that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the main cause. The IPCC report says that: observations of climate change, its impacts and causes, are alarming; without additional mitigation (by reducing greenhouse gas emissions) climate change will lead to significant risks; adaptation to climate change must start now; reducing the risks of climate change is urgent, possible and affordable. The latest IPCC report is seen as the main input for a key United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference in Bali this December. The meeting will discuss a follow-up to the Kyoto Protocol to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, which was agreed by the UNFCCC in 1997 and came into force in 2005. 'This report further underlines the importance of agreeing on a next step, a post-Kyoto global emission reduction scheme. The Bali meeting should be a watershed \u2014 if we don't achieve a global agreement to cut future emissions there \u2014 it may be too late, Professor McGlade said.

The Agency has worked on developing this set since 2005, in collaboration with countries, international organisations, non-governmental organisations, the European Commission and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). What is now ready is a detailed description of each of the indicators, complete with methodological data, i.e. how to calculate and use them. Some of the indicators such as the abundance and distribution of selected species directly track the impact on a part of Europe's biodiversity. Others reflect threats to biodiversity such as the presence of invasive alien species. Some, like the status of commercial fish stocks look at sustainable use of biodiversity resources and some, like fragmentation of natural and semi-natural areas, address the issue of ecosystem integrity. Taken as a whole, the set can help policy-makers assess the impact that various economic sectors and sectoral policies have on Europe\u2019s biodiversity. One challenge when developing the set of indicators has been to find indicators with good geographical coverage, that is to say indicators which can be calculated for many pan-European countries. Other challenges have been to boil the set down to a manageable number of indicators, and to choose the ones that are most helpful to reach policy objectives. As the availability of data from public bodies varies, use has been made of data from non-governmental environmental organisations (NGOs). Monitoring, conservation and assessment of biodiversity depend to a much greater degree on NGO activities than what other environmental issues do. Funding for biodiversity monitoring also lags behind national investments in other environmental issues, like air and water quality, and air emissions. The Agency hopes that the existence of the set of biodiversity indicators and the recognition in the Biodiversity Declaration will motivate countries to improve their data collection. Policy background Fifteen years after the adoption of the UN's Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1992, the recognition of biodiversity loss has gained in political profile both at global, national and regional levels. This has resulted in commitments for action by heads of states, initiated in 2001 in the European Union. While at global level, the target is 'to achieve a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss', the one set at EU and pan-European level is even more ambitious, namely to 'halt the loss of biodiversity' by 2010. The SEBI 2010 activities are relevant in several policy contexts: European Union: by implementing the biodiversity indicators, the EU follows up on the message from a major stakeholder conference in 2004 on what was needed to reach the 2010 objectives. This message was later endorsed by the EU Environment Council. The biodiversity indicators also support the Lisbon Agenda, the sustainable development strategy, the habitats and birds directives and the biodiversity strategy; Pan-European: as a follow-up to the 2003 Kiev Resolution on Biodiversity, SEBI 2010 supports the UNECE Environment for Europe process and the PEBLDS; Global: the EU biodiversity headline indicators are based on the CBD indicators, customized to the European needs. Therefore SEBI 2010 also responds to CBD Decision VII/30 on the future evaluation of progress with the convention; National: many countries have also developed indicators to monitor their biodiversity. SEBI 2010 proposes indicators that may be adopted at the national level if this has not yet been done, though there is no obligation for countries to do so.

Jeff Huntington, head of the environmental assessment programme at the EEA The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol sets outs cuts in emissions of certain gases by 2012, after which new commitments are needed. Emissions from international aviation and shipping are the fastest growing source of greenhouse gases. EU carbon dioxide emissions from international aviation and navigation have increased by 96 % and 50 %, respectively, between 1990 and 2005. However, both sectors are exempt from the Kyoto Protocol. Developed countries are instead requested to work through two UN bodies, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to limit emissions from these sectors. The ICAO and the IMO have had little success in cutting emissions from the two sectors and there has been a great deal of debate surrounding their exclusion from the Kyoto Protocol. The Oslo workshop, co-organised by the Norwegian government and EEA, focused on identifying potential technical obstacles to including international aviation and shipping from future international commitments to limit climate change. The workshop found that no genuine technical obstacles existed that could not be solved. 'If we are going to meet the long term targets of minimizing global warming to a maximum of two degrees Celsius, emissions from international aviation and shipping have to be included in future international agreements like those from all other sectors,' said Jeff Huntington, head of the environmental assessment programme at the EEA.

It was recommended that at the national level, priority action should be taken to internalise environmental costs through an environmental fiscal reform, to identify 'beacons' of sustainable living and to develop a long term vision of sustainable consumption and production. Finally, participants recommended that the United Nations' process to develop a 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production \u2014 the so-called Marrakech process \u2014 should encourage national governments to integrate sustainable consumption and production objectives into ministries beyond environment. Further the Marrakech process should develop communications strategies and campaigns with national organisations to reach out to consumers for actions and involve financial institutions in its process. Responding to the recommendations, 'the EEA will implement a number of concrete steps, including identifying indicators of sustainable consumption and production, analysing the effectiveness of green public procurement in selected Member States and providing information on the impacts of consumption to citizens across Europe' said EEA Executive Director Prof. Jacqueline McGlade.

'Governments from all countries, developed and developing, have achieved a major step forwards in protecting the ozone layer and at the same time combating climate change in an effective way', says Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director at the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen. HCFCs are chemicals replacing more ozone-damaging chemicals such as CFCs (chloroflurocarbons) in air conditioning and some forms of refrigeration equipment and foams. CFCs are already being phased out under earlier decisions. There is mounting evidence that HCFCs contribute to global warming. These gases are not covered by the Kyoto Protocol which does address all other main greenhouse gases from human activities. Thus apart from helping restoring the ozone layer the phasing out of HCFCs also reduces global greenhouse gas emissions and helps tackling climate change. The agreement to accelerate the phase out happened under the 20 year-old UN Montreal Protocol, a treaty to protect the Earth\u2019s ozone layer. Developed countries agreed to reduce production and consumption by 2010 by 75 per cent and by 90 per cent by 2015 with final phase out in 2020. Developing countries have agreed to cut production and consumption by 10 per cent in 2015; by 35 per cent by 2020 and by 67.5 per cent by 2025 with a final phase-out in 2030.

The latest in a series of assessments of the pan-European environment published by the EEA over the past 15 years, the report assesses environmental progress in 53 countries \u2014 an area with a total population of more than 870 million people. The region includes: Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia (EECCA), South East Europe (SEE), as well as Western and Central Europe (WCE). Improved implementation of existing policies and the setting of clear, realistic targets is a key recommendation of the report. However, a shared environmental information system is also urgently required to deal with a prevailing lack of reliable, accessible and comparable environmental information across the region. 'We need to further strengthen the will to act on environmental issues across the pan-European region. This requires a better understanding of the problems we face, their nature and distribution across societies and generations. Analysis, assessment, communication and education will help overcome this 'information gap' and will better equip those who need to act,' said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. Most of the environmental pressures in the region stem from economic activities such as agriculture, tourism, transport and energy, the report says. Current patterns of consumption and production also place an increasing demand on natural resources, putting our environment at further risk. Associated impacts are wide-ranging: water, air and soil quality differ greatly across the pan-European region. More than 100 million people do not have access to safe drinking water and sanitation. In many countries in Eastern Europe, Caucasus, Central Asia and South East Europe the quality of water supply and sanitation has deteriorated over the past 15 years with the rural population being most affected, the report says. Despite some success with air pollution, current levels \u2014 mainly nitrogen oxide, fine particles and ground-level ozone \u2014 are estimated to shorten average life expectancy in Western and Central European countries by almost a year and to threaten the healthy development of children. In Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia, the situation is assumed to be similarly bleak: here most air polluting emissions have increased by 10 % since 2000 as a result of economic recovery, increases in volume of transport and persisting poor effectiveness of air pollution policies. The report, which includes a comprehensive assessment of the marine environment across the pan-European region, expresses particular concern regarding over-fishing, eutrophication and mounting pressures on coastal environments. Major accidental oils spills have decreased in European seas. However, oil discharges from day to day activities are still significant. For biodiversity, the target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010 will not be met without considerable additional efforts. More than 700 European species are under threat from extinction, including a number of iconic species such as the Iberian lynx and the snow leopard, as a result of habitat destruction, degradation and disturbance. Impacts of climate change on society and natural resources are already visible worldwide. They are projected to become even more pronounced \u2014 even if global emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced drastically. The report stresses the urgency of adaptation to the potential risks of future climate change impacts. 'Ministers have designated the Belgrade conference to be a 'conference of delivery'. Our report shows that there has been progress. We have reduced some air pollution and have improved wastewater treatment. However, in an era of change, major concerns remain, such as climate, biodiversity and environment-related health threats. To respond to these complex environmental issues, we need continued cooperation across the pan-European region as well as targeted financial and technical support,' Professor McGlade said. Notes to the editor: View the full report here: http://www.eea.europa.eu/pan-european/fourth-assessment Europe's environment \u2014 The fourth assessment The result of unprecedented cooperation in sharing information the report, 'Europe's environment \u2014 The fourth assessment', aims to provide up-to-date and reliable information on the interactions between the environment and society and to highlight progress towards environmental targets at the pan-European level. From Kiev to Belgrade The 'Environment for Europe'(EfE) process now brings together 56 countries across three continents to jointly address environmental challenges. The process is a unique partnership of the member countries within the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) region. The EfE process also includes organisations of the United Nations system represented in the region, other intergovernmental organisations, regional environment centres, non-governmental organisations and other major groups. In support of this process, the EEA has prepared a series of assessments of the environment for the pan-European region to provide policy-relevant, up-to-date and reliable information on the interactions between the environment and society. The first comprehensive assessment of the state of the pan-European environment was presented in Sofia in 1995. Updated assessments were presented at the Ministerial Conferences in Aarhus in 1998 and Kiev in 2003. This is the fourth report in the series. Where possible, the report evaluates progress, primarily against the objectives of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community and the Environment Strategy for Countries of Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia. The report, 'Europe's environment \u2014 The fourth assessment' covers 53 countries: Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, FYR Macedonia, Malta, Republic of Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and Uzbekistan.

Figures from 2003 from Eurostat showed that 31 % of Copenhagen citizens walked or cycled to work. A survey made by Copenhagen municipality in 2005 showed this figure to be 59 %, but included journeys to school. During the European Mobility Week, events dedicated to sustainable mobility will be organised in more than 1 300 cities. Among the activities will be debates on the necessity for changes in behaviour in relation to mobility. These will focus in particular on the use of private cars in urban areas and the need to give up road space to other means of transport in order to improve mobility in cities and towns. Mobility Week 2007: reclaiming the streets The overall theme of the European Mobility Week this year is 'Streets for people'. The aim is to convey the message that increasing road space for cars is not the answer to existing transport challenges. On the contrary, the organisers insist, reducing road space for cars can be both a sustainable and efficient solution that does not sacrifice individual mobility \u2014 and that also allows for a healthier lifestyle for all citizens. Under the 'Streets for people' theme, local authorities are encouraged to give up road space to non-motorised traffic such as bicycles and pedestrians. The theme also highlights the need to improve air quality at local level, something which is a major concern for the European Union and its Member States. The European Mobility Week is an annual event organised by a consortium of three city-networks (Eurocities, Energie-Cit\u00e9s, Climate Alliance) in partnership with national ministries and agencies, European and international associations and organisations as well as the European Commission. This is the sixth anniversary of European Mobility Week. The EEA's Mobility Week engagement is part of the Agency's improvement activities under the EMAS environment certification scheme. This is an EU-initiated scheme for environment certification of companies and organisations. The Agency was awarded an EMAS certificate three years ago. In order to keep the certificate, the organisation in question has to undergo an annual auditing and keep working continuously to maintain and improve its environmental performance.

Cases on tobacco smoking and lead in petrol are forthcoming. Although the EEA does not have specific expertise in EMF, the case studies of public hazards analysed in the ' Late lessons' publication show that harmful exposures can be widespread before there is both 'convincing' evidence of harm from long-term exposures, and biological understanding of how that harm is caused. 'There are many examples of the failure to use the precautionary principle in the past, which have resulted in serious and often irreversible damage to health and environments. Appropriate, precautionary and proportionate actions taken now to avoid plausible and potentially serious threats to health from EMF are likely to be seen as prudent and wise from future perspectives. We must remember that precaution is one of the principles of EU environmental policy,' says Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. Current evidence, although limited, is strong enough to question the scientific basis for the present EMF exposure limits, according to the BioInitiative Working Group.

EU-15: Emissions of GHGs decreased by 2.0% in 2005 compared to the base year[1] under the Kyoto Protocol. EU-15: Emissions of GHGs decreased by 1.5% between 1990 and 2005 EU-27: Emissions of GHGs decreased by 0.7% (37.9 million tonnes CO2 equivalents) between 2004 and 2005 EU-27: Emissions of GHGs decreased by 7.9% compared to 1990 levels [1] The base year for most greenhouse gases under the Kyoto Protocol is 1990 for the EU-15, but almost all Member States use 1995 as the base year for fluorinated or 'F-gases' Which EU-15 countries show the biggest decreases in GHG emissions? Germany, Finland and the Netherlands contributed most to the EU-15 reduction in absolute terms (see table in Notes to the Editor). Reduction of CO2 emissions drove the overall decrease of greenhouse gas emissions in these countries. Germany reduced emissions by 2.3% or 23.5 million tonnes CO2 equivalents: a shift from coal to gas in the production of public electricity and heat was one of the main reasons for the decrease in emissions. In addition, emissions from road transportation and from households and services declined substantially. Finland reduced emissions by 14.6% or 11.9 million tonnes CO2 equivalents: emission reductions were mainly due to a substantial decrease in the use of fossil fuels in the production of public electricity and heat mainly due to electricity imports. Coal use, in particular, decreased. The Netherlands reduced emissions by 2.9% or 6.3 million tonnes CO2 equivalents: less fossil fuel was used for the production of public electricity and heat. The household and service sector used less fuel due to a warmer winter Other EU-15 countries which saw emissions decrease between 2004 and 2005 are: Belgium, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, Sweden and UK. Which sectors are mainly responsible for the GHG cuts? In absolute terms, the main sectors contributing to emissions reductions between 2004 and 2005 in the EU-15 were public electricity and heat production, households and services, and road transport. CO2 emissions from public electricity and heat production decreased by 0.9% (-9.6 million tonnes) mainly due to a reduction in the reliance on coal. CO2 emissions from households and services decreased by 1.7 % (7.0 million tonnes). Important decreases in emissions from household and services were reported by Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. One general reason for the decrease is the warmer weather conditions (milder winter) compared to the previous year. CO2 emissions from road transport decreased by 0.8% (6 million tonnes). This is mainly attributed to Germany, and is due to increased amounts of diesel oil driven cars, the effects of the eco-tax and fuel buying from outside Germany (fuel tourism). Which EU-15 countries have seen the biggest increases in GHG emissions? In absolute terms, Spain increased greenhouse gas emissions the most between 2004 and 2005 (see table in Notes to the Editor). In Spain, the increase in greenhouse gas emissions by 3.6% or 15.4 million tonnes CO2 equivalents came mainly from public electricity and heat production. This is due to a rise in electricity generation from fossil thermal power stations (17 %) and a decrease in electricity generation from hydropower plants (-33 %). Other EU-15 countries which saw emissions increase between 2004 and 2005 are: Austria, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Portugal. The EEA GHG data viewer The EEA GHG data viewer is an interactive tool that allows easy web access to the main data contained in the EC Greenhouse gas inventory report. The GHG data viewer enables the user to view and analyse emission trends for the main sectors and their sub sectors. It also facilitates comparison between emissions from selected countries and sectors. In addition, the GHG data viewer enables the production of graphics and the downloading of key emission estimates. EEA GHG Data Viewer Notes to the Editor: What is the annual GHG inventory report? This report is the EU's official submission to the UNFCCC on total domestic greenhouse gas emissions for the period 1990-2005. Domestic, in this context, refers to emissions from within the territory of the EU. It contains information about GHG emissions for the EU-15 and EU-27. It also thoroughly explains the process by which EU emissions are derived and quality checked. The EEA is responsible for compiling and publishing this report annually using information reported by national governments under the EC GHG Monitoring Mechanism. How does the information in the report fit with the EU Emission Trading Scheme? In 2005 the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) covered approx. 47% of the total CO2 emissions and approx. 39% of total greenhouse gas emissions in EU-15. The EU ETS covered approx. 49% of the total CO2 emission and 41% of total greenhouse gas emissions in EU-25. In general, EU ETS information has been used by EU Member States as one input for calculating total CO2 emissions for the Energy and Industrial Processes sectors in this report. However, an explicit quantification of the contribution of the EU ETS to total CO2 emissions at sectoral and sub-sectoral level is not yet available for EU-15 or EU-25. What is the significance of this report in the context of the Kyoto Protocol? The EU-15 has a common target under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by 8 %, compared to the base year. The EU-27 does not have a common Kyoto target. Official reporting of emissions for compliance purposes under the Kyoto Protocol does not begin until 2010 \u2013 when emissions will be reported for the year 2008. In the meantime, this report is the most relevant and accurate source of information on greenhouse gas emissions for the EU. It can be used for tracking the EU's performance when it comes to reducing domestic greenhouse emissions (i.e. emissions within its territory) towards meeting the Kyoto targets. Parties to the Kyoto Protocol are allowed to use carbon sinks as well as the so called 'flexible mechanisms' to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions outside their national territories - as a supplement to domestic reductions. Hence, domestic action is the primary method of achieving the Kyoto targets. This inventory report suggests that domestic emissions of GHGs decreased by approximately 2.0 % compared to the base year under the Kyoto Protocol. Table 1: Greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 equivalents (excluding carbon sinks) and Kyoto Protocol targets for 2008\u201312 (1) For EU-15 the base year for CO2, CH4 and N2O is 1990; for the fluorinated gases 12 Member States have selected 1995 as the base year, whereas Austria, France and Italy have chosen 1990. As the EU-15 inventory is the sum of Member States' inventories, the EU-15 base year estimates for fluorinated gas emissions are the sum of 1995 emissions for 12 Member States and 1990 emissions for Austria, France and Italy. The EU-15 base year emissions also include emissions from deforestation for the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK (\u2018The European Community's initial report under the Kyoto Protocol' (EEA, 2006)).

Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA The EEA report, 'Transport and environment: on the way to a new common transport policy' says that European transport policy must deal with spiralling demand for transport. Between 1990 and 2003, passenger transport volumes in the EEA countries grew by 20\u00a0%. Air transport grew the most, 96\u00a0%, during this period. While emissions from most other sectors (energy supply, industry, agriculture, waste management) dropped between 1990 and 2004, emissions from transport increased substantially driven by this increase in demand. Transport is responsible for 21\u00a0% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the EU-15 (excluding international aviation and maritime transport). Road transport contributes 93 % of the total of all transport emissions. However, emissions from international aviation are growing fastest with an increase of 86 % between 1990 and 2004. GHG emissions (excluding marine and aviation) from transport grew the most in Luxembourg and Ireland between 1990 and 2004 with respective increases of 156 and 140\u00a0%. The average increase in the 32 EEA member countries (see notes) was 25\u00a0%. 'By suggesting that we simply deal with the environmental impacts of transport, the mid-term review of the 2001 White Paper on Transport could be interpreted as a softening of Europe's line on the need to deal with transport volumes. This cannot be the case,' said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. 'We cannot deal with the increasing GHG emissions, noise pollution and landscape fragmentation caused by transport without dealing with the increasing traffic across the spectrum: on our roads and railways, in the air and by sea. Technical advances, such as cleaner, more fuel-efficient engines are very important, but we cannot innovate our way out of the emissions problem from transport,' she said. The report also highlights the significant role that transport subsidies play in terms of directing transport choices. Between 270 and 290 billion Euro is spent annually in Europe in transport subsidies. Almost half of these subsidies go to road transport, one of the least environmentally friendly modes. The EEA will release a detailed study of transport subsidies in March 2007. Pollution from transport is also having a direct effect on our health.\u00a0 Almost 25 % of the EU-25 population live less than 500 metres from a road carrying more than three million vehicles per year. Consequently, almost four million life-years are lost each year due to high pollution levels, the report says.

Prof. McGlade 'These new findings from the IPCC are\u00a0alarming. The recent observations and measurements reflected in the report dispel any doubts that the global climate is changing and that human activities have caused most of the observed changes in the past 50 years.\u00a0International action is needed to address climate change by both enhanced mitigation and adaptation efforts,' says Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. The report assesses the latest scientific knowledge on climate change and constitutes the first part of the IPCC's forthcoming Fourth Assessment Report. It confirms the main findings of the Third Assessment Report from 2001, but many results can now be better quantified and there is even higher confidence in them. The report\u2019s key conclusions are: Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising sea level. It is 'very likely' that increases in man-made greenhouse gas emissions have caused most of the rise in globally averaged temperatures since the middle of the 20th century. It is 'extremely unlikely' that this warming was due to natural climate variability alone. During the last 100 years the Earth has warmed by 0.76\u00a0\u00b0C on average, and the rate of warming has further increased. The 11 warmest years on record have all occurred in the last 12\u00a0years. The second half of the 20th century was the warmest period in the northern hemisphere for at least 1\u00a0300 years. Europe has warmed by about 1\u00a0\u00b0C over the past 100 years, faster than the global average. The best estimates for projected global warming this century of a further rise in the global average temperature range from 1.8 to 4.0\u00a0\u00b0C by 2100 for different scenarios which do not assume that more action is taken to limit emissions. The full uncertainty range for the projected temperature increase this century is 1.1\u20136.4\u00a0\u00b0C. Rates of observed sea level rise almost doubled from 18 centimetres per century in 1961\u20132003 to 31\u00a0cm per century in 1993\u20132003. The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has continued to increase due to man-made emissions, and the rate of increase has further accelerated. Current concentrations of CO2 and methane are the highest for at least 650\u00a0000\u00a0years. Extreme weather events have increased and regional climate patterns are changing. Heat waves and other weather extremes, as well as changes in atmospheric circulation patterns, storm tracks and precipitation, can now be traced back to climate change caused by human activities. Scientists have improved their ability to predict future climate change. Confidence in regional climate change projections has increased due to better models and more powerful computers. The temperature over land and at high northern latitudes will be higher than the global average. In the Arctic it could be on average 6\u00a0\u00b0C \u2013 and possibly as much as 8\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0\u2014 warmer by the end of this century than at the end of the 20th.\u00a0 More information: IPCC webpage IPCC report", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/proof-of-climate-change-unequivocal"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0716", "date": "2007-01-25", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Pressure increases on Arctic environment", "text": "The conference focused simultaneously on the development potential of the Arctic region and the environmental challenges this presents.

The report, \u2018Urban sprawl in Europe\u00a0- the ignored challenge\u2019, shows that many environmental problems in Europe are caused by rapidly expanding urban areas. The global economy, cross border transport networks, large scale societal, economic and demographic changes and differences in national planning laws are some of the major drivers of change to the urban environment. EU policy to co-ordinate and control planning is required, the report says. Urban sprawl occurs when the rate of land-use conversion exceeds the rate of population growth. More than a quarter of the EU territory has now been directly affected by urban land use, according to the report. Europeans are living longer and more of us live alone putting greater demands on living space. We travel further and consume more. Between 1990 and 2000, more than 800 000 hectares of Europe's land was built on. That is an area three times the size of Luxembourg. If this trend continues, our urban area will double in just over a century. Sprawling cities demand more energy supply, require more transport infrastructure and consume larger amounts of land. This damages the natural environment and increases greenhouse gas emissions. Among the consequences are climate change, increased air and noise pollution. As a result, urban sprawl impacts directly on the quality of life of people living in and around cities. \"Urban sprawl is a reflection of changing lifestyles and consumption patterns rather than an expanding population. Increasing demands from housing, food, transport and tourism all demand land. Agricultural land surrounding cities is often under priced and this is an issue facilitating sprawl in the face of the above pressures\", said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. \"EU Cohesion and Structural Funds, key drivers affecting European societies, are also major causes of sprawl across Europe. The impact of funding is especially relevant as the EU and its Member States flesh out how they plan to spend the next EU budget. New Member States, in particular, will see dramatic changes. They should be provided with policy guidelines to help avoid the environmental pitfalls that a sudden injection of funds can encourage,\" Professor McGlade said. The report contains case studies from seven cities across Europe illustrating both good and bad approaches to urban planning over the past 50 years. However, the report stresses that sprawl is not a localised phenomenon and is affecting almost all of Europe\u2019s cities. The report suggests future actions and policies that could tackle the continued spread of sprawl.

It also evaluates projections of European countries\u2019 progress towards their 2010 greenhouse gas emissions targets. \u201cLevels of greenhouse gases would be much higher without current efforts to cut emissions. However, several countries within the EU-15 are not doing enough and could jeopardise the collective effort,\u201d said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA.\u00a0 The EU-15 has a Kyoto target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 8 % on 1990 levels by 2012. Within this overall target, each EU-15 member state has a differentiated emissions target, which can be achieved by a variety of means. Only by implementing all existing and planned domestic policy measures and using Kyoto mechanisms and carbon sinks, can emissions be brought down to 8.0\u00a0%, the EU-15 target, according to the report. However, this projection relies on figures from several Member States suggesting they will cut emissions by more than is required to meet their national targets and this cannot be assured, the report stresses. Looking ahead to 2010, the report says that existing domestic policies and measures will reduce EU-15 greenhouse gas emissions by a net effect of 0.6 % from 1990 levels. When additional domestic policies and measures (i.e. those planned but not yet implemented) are taken into account, the EU-15 could reduce emissions by an additional 4.0 %. The projected use of Kyoto mechanisms by ten of the EU-15 will reduce emissions by a further 2.6\u00a0% at a cost of EUR 2 830 million. The use of carbon sinks, such as planting forests to remove CO2, would reduce emissions by an additional 0.8\u00a0%. Between 1990 and 2004, EU-15 greenhouse gas emissions decreased from most sectors, the report says. However, emissions from the transport sector increased by nearly 26\u00a0% and are projected to increase to 35 % above 1990 levels by 2010, if countries use only existing policies. If additional policies are implemented, Member States project that transport emissions will, at best, stabilise at 2004 levels. The ten new EU Member States are not part of the joint EU-15 target and all, except Cyprus and Malta, have individual targets under the Kyoto Protocol. They are all on track to meet their targets, but this is largely due to the collapse of economies in the 1990s and emissions are now rising again in these countries, the report says.

EU Kyoto Targets The EU-15 has a Kyoto target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 8 % on 1990 levels by 2012. Within this overall target, each EU-15 member state has a differentiated reduction target; some should reduce emissions while others are allowed a limited increase. New Member States have individual targets except Cyprus and Malta, which have no targets. Countries can achieve these targets by a variety of means. EU emissions trading scheme The EU emissions trading scheme is the European Union\u2019s climate change policy tool, which helps industries to cut their CO2 emissions in a cost-effective way. It requires a cap on emissions for all large CO2 emission sources. Note: All Member States should have delivered a national allocation plan (NAP) for the Kyoto period to the European Commission. This plan should include \u201cemission caps\u201d for industries that are included in the emission trading sectors, and should have been delivered by 30th June, 2006. However, not all countries have done so to date and the Commission has not so far published formal opinions on the NAPs. Because the EEA report only includes information on national projections provided by countries by 6th June, 2006, it does not include any new national projection information provided within the recent NAPs.\u00a0 For more information on NAPs see: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/2nd_phase_ep.htm Domestic policies and measures Domestic policies and measures take place within the national boundaries of the country and include: the promotion of electricity from renewable energy; improvements in energy efficiency; promotion of biofuels in transport; reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from cars; recovery of gases from landfills and reduction of fluorinated gases. Kyoto Mechanisms The Kyoto Mechanisms help developed countries to achieve their Kyoto targets by gaining credits through carbon cutting activities in other countries. They also help the transfer of low-carbon technologies to other countries. The projected use of Kyoto mechanisms by ten of the EU-15 Member States will reduce emissions by 2010 by 2.6\u00a0%. These countries are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.

This would lead to a global sea level rise of several meters. The consequences for low-lying countries and cities would be enormous. There is scientific uncertainty about the likelihood of such events, which he recognises. Gore's main point remains clear: whatever the eventual impacts, there is a need to act immediately to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This can be achieved with current technologies and in an affordable way, he says, although he presents few specific examples in the film. The movie also gives a fascinating insight into the moral drive of one man to address this issue. Gore has long been an advocate of environmental matters but has struggled to get his message across. He reflects on this struggle and emphasises how he is still trying to do so: he has presented his slideshow over 1,000 times around the globe.\u00a0 In the end, he states that ultimately it is up to each individual to act upon the messages of the movie. However, it is not until the credits role (interspersed with catchy slogans: \"walk more, buy a hybrid car, demand green energy, expect more from your parents, pray,\" etc.) that any real advice on action is given. Perhaps Al Gore and the film would be more effective if more time was spent on options for action and their implications for individuals? Having said that, the film is convincing and Gore uses data from well established scientific sources, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to back up his points. He also succeeds in using these facts in a very transparent and convincing way. As a result, the film is a good lesson in communicating complicated science simply, but accurately. So see the movie, help get the message across and encourage others to do so too! For more information on the facts on climate change, see the IPCC web site (2001 report) http://www.ipcc.ch/.

The recent hot and calm weather in Europe has provided perfect conditions for algae. While surface waters have remained still and undisturbed, algae blooms have flourished uninterrupted. However, the blooms are also helped by nutrient inputs caused by human activities. Nitrogen and phosphorus are critical nutrients for algae growth. Some algae, especially the blue/green algae found in Scandinavia, can absorb atmospheric nitrogen. Consequently, they can bloom in waters where only phosphorus is present. Nitrogen and Phospherus enter coastal waters as a result of human activities, such as run-off from agricultural land, fish farming and inadequately treated waste water. Phosphorus is found in everyday household products such as detergents, soap and shampoos. It is not unnatural for the population of algae to increase in summertime. And algae are an important part of the food chain, as they provide food for animal (zoo) planktons which are in turn eaten by fish and other aquatic wildlife. However, today's levels of algal blooms appear excessive. Most importantly is that human activities and favourable summer conditions combine to increase the levels of algal blooms. With the likelihood of climatic change bringing warmer summers in the future, today's excessive algae blooms may become more of a common sight in European waters. Health effects of algae:Some algae contain toxins, and therefore represent a health threat to humans and animals. These toxins vary depending on the species of algae. Some types of algae can cause skin and eye irritations, but the main risk comes from swallowing contaminated water. The symptoms of poisoning from toxic algae include nausea, bowel or intestine problems and fever. Nevertheless, adults would have to swallow a considerable amount of water before any adverse health effects would occur. These incidents are highly unlikely and very rare. However, care should be taken with small children. Health authorities recommended that children should refrain from bathing in these waters. Similarly, pets and farm animals could also be put at risk by drinking contaminated water.

Alarmingly, it points to underlying changes in Europe\u2019s marine ecosystems resulting from a combination of climate change, nutrient enrichment, tourism and fishing. Fishing has indirectly helped jellyfish to thrive. As larger fish are removed from the food chain, jellyfish face less competition for their own food. Also, climate change has brought warmer seawater and increased salinity, improving conditions for jellyfish growth. And inputs of nutrients into the sea from industry, households, and agriculture have increased the plankton population on which jellyfish feed. Boneless, brainless, bloodless\u2026\u00a0Boneless, brainless and bloodless yet successfully ocean-going for millions of years, jellyfish are creatures people find both fascinating and disgusting. While smaller jellyfish may feed on food particles in the water, larger species are predators. Competing with fish for food, larger jellyfish have thousands of trigger and stinger mechanisms on their tentacles making them perfectly geared for hunting and defence. European jellyfish are not deadly. However, some species can harm humans by direct contact with their toxins or indirect allergic reactions provoked by stings. The Portuguese-Man-o-War, which is not a jellyfish but a floating colony of organisms, is very harmful. And on rare occasions, its sting has been fatal. Found in European waters, the Portuguese Man-o-War usually lives out in the open sea, away from beaches and does not appear to swarm. However, single colonies have been known to hide among swarms of other species. Marine ecosystem changes Jellyfish have a seasonal lifecycle. Attaching themselves to rocks for part of the year, Jellyfish then swarm in the summer months. The effect of human activities on marine ecosystems and coastal regions exaggerates this natural cycle and can lead to enormous swarms suddenly appearing on Europe\u2019s shores. Moreover, the economic and ecosystem effects of jellyfish swarms are not unsubstantial with disruptions to industry and tourism often resulting. The Swedish nuclear power plant Oscarshamn had to close down a reactor on 29 August last summer following an accumulation of jellyfish in the cooling water. Fish farms in Scotland and Shetland have seen thousands of salmon in jellyfish-clogged fish cages die from lack of oxygen. Several Spanish beaches have had to close down this summer as the waters around the Costa del Sol, the Costa Blanca, the Costa Brava and the Balearic Islands are infested by large numbers of jellyfish. Although some jellyfish are eaten by fish, most fall prey to other species of jellyfish. Therefore, an independent and relatively stable food web of interlinked gelatinous predators exists.

Data from more than 500 air quality monitoring stations is sent to the EEA in Copenhagen every hour and displayed in (near) real time on the new web site. Either by entering a place name or by clicking on a map of Europe, users will be able to follow air quality locally and on a European scale. The web site will also include information on the health implications of the ozone values users are experiencing. \"As a joint European project, Ozone Web reflects the international character of air pollution. It is produced in one place but may have an impact in another many hundreds of kilometres away. The web site is an excellent example of how the EU can create partnerships with member countries to serve and empower its citizens,\" said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, executive director of the EEA. Ozone at high concentrations is a health hazard. It can irritate airways, causing breathing difficulties and damaging lungs after only a few hours of exposure. Up to 30% of Europe's urban population is exposed to ozone concentrations above the threshold levels set by the EU. Ozone pollution is responsible for as many as 20 000 deaths in Europe every year. In the stratosphere - 10 to 50 km above the Earth's surface - ozone protects life on Earth from the sun's ultraviolet rays. Nearer the earth's surface human activities lead to ozone concentrations several times higher than natural levels. When levels of ozone and other air pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter, are high, they can combine to form a harmful smog. However, the highest concentrations of ozone are not always found in city centres where the pollutants that form ozone are usually emitted. This is because an abundance of nitrogen oxide from traffic, often suppresses ozone formation. As ozone may be transported by the wind over distances of 400-500 km a day, the ozone incident may actually occur in suburban and rural areas far away from the source of the pollutants. \"The EU has made it obligatory for countries to alert citizens on a national level when ozone levels reach particular levels. However, Ozone Web goes much further by allowing you to monitor ozone anytime, from anywhere. You can monitor ozone levels in a neighbouring country or at holiday destination, check recent trends and track the spread of ozone across Europe by the wind,\" Professor McGlade said.

During these periods, a number of exceedances of the alert threshold were reported in Europe. The ozone episodes covered a large proportion of Europe including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Switzerland.

Coasts also act as economic gateways to Europe; they are part of the fabric of many societies and are crucial to our quality of life,\" said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, executive director of the EEA. \"However, to protect our coastal areas, we need to value them not as playgrounds or transport lanes with unlimited building, living, recreational and shipping potential but as fragile systems that underpin landscapes and amenities at the core of many communities,\" Professor McGlade said. Population densities along European coast are higher and continue to grow faster than those inland, the report says. Between 1990 and 2000 artificial surfaces (primarily roads and buildings) in coastal zones increased in almost all European countries. The fastest development occurred in Portugal (34 % increase in ten years), Ireland (27 %), Spain (18 %), followed by France, Italy and Greece. The most affected regional seacoast is the Western Mediterranean. Economic restructuring, much of it driven by EU subsidies has been a driver for infrastructure development, which in turn has attracted residential sprawl. Climate change, an ageing, more affluent population, increased leisure and cheaper travel compound these pressures leading to a crises for Europe's coastline, the report says. \"Think of the infrastructure required to get one family from Northern Europe to a beach in Spain: transport policies and subsidies, passport agreements, and funding, to name a few. Now think of the impacts on the final destination. As tourists we may contribute to local income and employment, but we also bring pollution and eco-system degradation to areas that have little policy protection and are ill suited to withstand such an intense level of use. While the impacts may be local, the pressures and solutions need to be on a pan-European scale,\" Professor McGlade said. Despite this challenging situation, new opportunities are being offered to tackle coastal issues in a more holistic way that views our coastlines as mosaics of rivers and their catchments, coastal zones and marine regions. The on-going implementation of 'integrated coastal zone management' (ICZM), reviewed by the European Commission in 2006, is to be welcomed, the report says. \"There is a long history of policy initiatives to protect Europe's coastline but these have never been implemented in an integrated manner. ICZM involves all relevant stakeholders and takes a long-term view of the coastal zone in an attempt to balance the needs of development with protection of the very resources that sustain coastal economies. It also takes into account the public's concern about the deteriorating environmental, socio-economic and cultural state of the European coastline,\" Professor McGlade said.

For Europe, population densities of coastal regions (NUTS3) are on average 10 % higher than inland. However, in some countries this figure can be more than 50 %. There are many regions where the coastal population is at least five times the European average density. Artificial surfaces spread by 190 km2 per year between 1990 and 2000. Due to the irreversible nature of land cover change from natural to urban and infrastructure development, these changes are seen as one of the main threats to the sustainability of coastal zones. 61 % of total land uptake by artificial surfaces was due to housing, services and recreation. The number of invasive creatures in Europe's seas increased substantially between the 1960s and 1980s, particularly in the Mediterranean. Their effect on native coastal ecosystems is becoming difficult and costly to control. The jellyfish Mnemiopsis leydyi is a common example. An explosive growth in its population occurred after its arrival in ships' ballast waters in the late 1980's. This caused devastation in Black Sea fish stocks, oyster and even the indigenous jellyfish population (EEA, 2005b). The jellyfish even found its way into the land locked Caspian sea, causing serious changes to the whole ecosystem (Karpinsky et al., 2005). The global sea surface temperature has warmed by a mean of 0.6 \u00b0C since the late 19th century. The result of sea surface warming is redistribution and loss of marine organisms and a higher frequency of anomalous and toxic phytoplankton bloom events.

The second, and more important, objective is to find our why results of such studies differ. Here, the report looks at how definitions of system boundaries, i.e. how much of the full life cycle system is included in the assessment, and other parameters influence the results. The report uses the findings to discuss the possibilities and limitations of LCA and CBA studies as tools in guiding decisions on waste policy, particularly at European level. The reviewed LCA studies, which pass a quality control test, all reach the same conclusion on treatment options - namely that from an environmental point of view recycling is better than incineration or landfilling. For the CBA studies, it is not possible to set a common quality standard due to large variations between the studies. However, it is noted that the analysed, quality selected CBA studies, do not reach a consensus on what is environmentally the best option. The two ways of approaching the problem are quite different: LCA is based on natural sciences and analyses environmental impacts from \"cradle to grave\" of a specific product or process. CBA is based on welfare economics and attempts to place a monetary value on the environmental and social impacts of a policy, and add them to its commercial costs. Individually, these tools are not able to explain all relevant aspects of a project, and they should rather be seen as complementary. All nine LCA studies conclude that recycling results in fewer overall environmental impacts than both landfilling and incineration. More than half of the nine CBA studies conclude that recycling is the preferred waste management option, whereas incineration and/or landfill are preferred in the remaining studies and scenarios. If the time cost is excluded, the preference for recycling becomes more explicit. Overall, the nine CBA studies differ a lot with regard to both system boundaries and methodology. A key parameter such as the price put on the time individuals spend on recycling tends to influence conclusions a lot. This, and the limited number of studies, makes it impossible to draw any firm conclusions from the CBA studies on what is the preferable option for waste paper management. The EEA report thus notes that the outcome of the studies depends a lot on the implicit assumptions made. Furthermore, while LCA methodology is fairly well developed, there is not yet a generally accepted methodology for CBA studies. This of course complicates comparisons. Also, LCA studies tend to be less bound to national geographical limitations than CBA studies, though they do attempt to say something more general. When offered to policymakers as a support for their decision-making, it is important that they are made aware of such limitations.

Reduced consumption must also play a role in securing supply and protecting the environment. \"In the context of rising oil and gas prices and increasing concerns about energy security, it is timely to stress that environmental sustainability must be treated as an equal to securing energy supply,\" said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, executive director of the EEA. The report, which assesses trends in the energy sector in Europe between 1990 and 2003, was released to coincide with today's Environment council meeting in Luxembourg. The report builds on a set of indicators measuring progress towards integration of environmental considerations within the energy sector, as demanded by the Cardiff process. Environmental pressures from energy production were reduced between 1990 and 2003, the report says. Since 1990 air pollutant emissions from energy production and consumption have been reduced substantially, but further reductions are still necessary to achieve long term air quality targets. Environmental pressures from electricity production were also reduced as a result of a switch from coal to gas as well as abatement measures. However, since 1999/2000 this positive trend has slowed and even reversed in some countries. In particular, energy-related emissions of greenhouse gases have been increasing in recent years. Technological advances, such as more efficient power plants, the introduction of abatement measures (catalytic converters in cars, flue gas desulphurisation in power plants, for example) and increasing renewable energy options (bioenergy, wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal) are being undermined by surges in consumption. This is due to rising demand for transport and electricity, which continue to rely on fossil fuels. The report also notes that an acceptable method of dealing with waste from nuclear power stations has yet to be identified and implemented. \"The role of nuclear power is currently being discussed in some Member States in the context of climate change and energy security. It is important to ensure that a nuclear option does not starve new alternative energy technologies of crucial financial support or undermine an emphasis on energy efficiency,\" Professor McGlade said. The report notes a window of opportunity for an environmentally-sustainable energy sector as many European countries discuss how to upgrade or replace out-dated power plants. \"Ensuring a long-term integrated energy framework is urgent due to the imminent need for investment in energy production infrastructure. This opens up opportunities for an environmentally-sustainable development of the energy sector enhancing renewable energy and energy efficiency, Professor McGlade said.

Web links You can access the report here: http://reports.eea.europa.eu/eea_report_2006_8/en Note: The data in this report covers the period between 1990 and 2003. The EEA recently launched the 2006 greenhouse gas emissions inventory report for Europe. This report contains data on greenhouse gases for 2004 and can be accessed here: Key Trends in Energy Production 1990 -2003 Key trend 1: Energy-related greenhouse gas emissions resume upward trend after decreases in the 1990s, putting long-term reduction targets at risk. Energy-related greenhouse gas emissions fell by 2.6 % between 1990 and 2003, but have been rising slowly since 1999. A major contributing factor to the recent increase is higher electricity production from coal power plants. In addition, there is a long-term trend of growing transport emissions due to increased transport volumes. This has offset much of the improvements achieved in other sectors. Further substantial decreases of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions are required in order to meet long-term emission reduction targets proposed by the EU. Key trend 2: Energy-related air pollutant emissions decline but air quality continues to have adverse effects on health and ecosystems. Energy-related emissions of acidifying substances, tropospheric ozone precursors and particles decreased by 56 %, 41 % and 47 % between 1990 and 2003, respectively. These reductions were driven by the enhanced use of abatement techniques, energy efficiency improvements and fuel switching from coal to natural gas. Since 2000, the decline in some air pollutant emissions has slowed due to a continuing rise in energy consumption and a renewed increase in the use of coal. Despite reduced emissions of air pollutants, air quality in many cities does not yet meet the limit values set by European legislation. Moreover, human health and ecosystems are still adversely affected. Further emission reductions are needed to achieve long-term air quality targets. Key trend 3: Fossil fuels continue to dominate energy consumption but abatement measures and fuel switching have reduced environmental pressures. Combustion of fossil fuels is the main cause of carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions and accounts for almost 80 % of total energy consumption and 55 % of electricity production. Some of these environmental pressures were reduced between 1990 and 2003. One of the main reasons for falling greenhouse emissions was the shift from coal to cleaner natural gas in electricity production, although this fuel switch has slowed since 1999. Oil consumption grew as a result of increased transport volumes and oil continues to be the most important fuel in total energy consumption. The share of nuclear power remained almost constant. Key trend 4: Energy consumption continues to grow, making it more difficult to reduce energy-related environmental pressures Final energy consumption in the EU-25 increased by 11.6 % between 1990 and 2003. This trend is expected to continue unless additional energy saving measures are implemented. Rising personal incomes and changes in lifestyle with subsequent growing transport volumes led to an increase in energy consumption of households, services and transport. Transport is now the largest consumer of final energy. At the same time energy consumption in industry decreased as a result of energy efficiency improvements and a shift from energy-intensive industries to services. Electricity consumption increased particularly rapidly due to its attractiveness and flexibility in end-use, a growth of the services sector and an increase in the ownership of electrical appliances. Key trend 5: Overall shares of renewables in total energy and electricity consumption remain at low levels despite large increases of some renewable options. The production of energy and electricity from renewable energy sources grew steadily between 1990 and 2003, with particularly large increases in wind and solar electricity. However, the increase in the share of renewables in total energy and electricity consumption was limited due to rising energy and electricity consumption and less hydropower production as a result of low rainfall in 2002 and 2003. These factors offset the increase of renewables compared to total consumption. In 2003, the share of renewables in total energy consumption and gross electricity consumption was 6 % and 12.8 %, respectively. A significant further expansion will be needed to meet the EU indicative targets of a 12 % share in total energy consumption and 21 % share in gross electricity consumption by 2010. Key trend 6: Most energy prices have been increasing since around 2000 after significant reductions during the 1990s. Tax levels increased since 1990, but external costs have not been fully internalised. With the exception of transport, energy prices for most fuels decreased during the 1990s before starting to increase again around 2000. This increase is mostly due to rising global oil and gas prices. These price rises led to increased calls for enhanced energy saving measures. Throughout the 1990s, price levels were not high enough to offer much incentive for energy savings. Tax levels increased over the entire period, which may indicate that external costs of energy consumption, due to environmental effects, were internalised to a greater extent than in previous years. Nevertheless, tax levels generally remain below the estimated environmental external costs.

In 2004, about 11 tonnes of greenhouse gases were released on average per person in the EU-25. The 0.4 % increase is comparable to the amount of CO2 emissions released by 3 million people if they were to drive their cars around the earth,\" said Professor Jacqueline McGlade, executive director of the EEA. Spain sees largest increase in GHG emissions Spain and Italy saw the largest emission increases in absolute terms with plus 19.7 (4.8 %) and 5.1 (0.9 %) million tonnes respectively. On the positive side, 2004 saw emissions reductions from Germany (- 9.1 million tonnes, - 0.9 %), Denmark (- 6 million tonnes, -8.1 %) and Finland (- 4.2 million tonnes, - 4.9 %). While, total GHG emissions for the EU-25 were 4.8 % below 1990 figures - the base year to which most GHG's are to be scaled back towards under the Kyoto protocol - the EU-15 has only decreased its emissions by 38 million tonnes (0.9 %) compared to the base year. Transport drives CO2 emissions rise in the EU-15 Emissions of CO2, the most problematic GHG, were 4.4% above 1990 levels for the EU-15. Compared to 2003, CO2 emissions increased by 0.6 %. Road transport was the biggest contributor to this trend with an increase of 12 million tonnes of CO2 (1.5%). However, manufacturing of iron and steel also increased their CO2 outputs with 8 million tonnes (5.4%). In country terms, Spain increased it's output of CO2 most dramatically in 2004 as energy production switched to fossil fuels to make up for a shortfall in hydro power caused by drought. This increase in CO2 drove the overall increase in GHG emissions in Spain in 2004. 'Despite the various policy initiatives, this report highlights that the trend is still going in the wrong direction. Europe must implement all planned policies and measures relating to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The forthcoming National Allocation Plans for 2008-2012 under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme must also be ambitious in the context of national commitments to reduce emissions,\" Prof McGlade said. Notes to the editor: The inventory report is the annual submission of the EU to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It is more detailed on the EU-15 (pre-2004 Member States) as these countries are covered by the 'EU burden-sharing agreement' set out by the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the UNFCCC. Changes in greenhouse gas emissions in EU-15 - sectors The overall 11.5 million tonnes increase in EU-15 emissions between 2003 and 2004 reflected higher greenhouse gas emissions from industry (+16 million tonnes, +1.8%) which was mainly due to higher emissions from iron and steel production as well as refrigeration and air conditioning. Transport emissions increased by 14 million tonnes (+1.7%) between 2003 and 2004. In road transportation the substantial increase of CO2 from diesel oil consumption (+23 million tonnes, +5 %) was only partly offset by the decrease of CO2 from gasoline consumption (-10 million tonnes, -3 %). Greenhouse gas emissions from energy industries were almost stable (+0.1%) which is mainly the net result of opposing trends: CO2 from oil refining increased by 3.9 million tonnes (+3.3 %) CO2 from electricity and heat production decreased by 3.2 million tonnes (-0.3 %): whereas power production increased by 2 % in line with increasing electricity demand within the EU-15, a shift of fuel use in thermal power stations from coal (-1 %) and oil (-14 %) to gas (+9 %) and biomass (+13 %) in combination with increased use of wind power (+32 %), hydro power (+4%) and nuclear power (+1 %) contributed to emission decreases from electricity and heat production. Greenhouse gas emissions from households and the services sector decreased by 9 million tonnes (-1.4%). Emissions in the agriculture sector decreased mainly due to declining number of cattle and lower emissions from agricultural soils. Other reductions were achieved for fugitive emissions from coal mining and from natural gas. Emissions from the waste sector have decreased due to increased methane recovery and less waste land filled. Changes in greenhouse gas emissions in EU-15 Member States Between 2003 and 2004, Spain and Italy saw the largest emission increases in absolute terms (+19.7 million tonnes CO2 equivalents and +5.1 million tonnes CO2 equivalents respectively). On the positive side, 2004 saw emission reductions from Germany (-9.1 million tonnes CO2 equivalents), Denmark (-6.0 million tonnes CO2 equivalents), and Finland (-4.2 million tonnes CO2 equivalents): Spanish emission increases mainly occurred in CO2 from electricity and heat production (+8.9 million tonnes), CO2 from energy consumption in other manufacturing industry (+3.4 million tonnes), CO2 from road transport (+3.3 million tonnes) and CO2 from iron and steel production (+ 2.2 million tonnes, both energy and process related emissions). The strong increase from electricity and heat production reflects a strong increase of thermal electricity production partly due to low hydro power generation. In Italy CO2 emissions increased mostly from oil refining (+2.4 million tonnes) and from road transport (+2.0 million tonnes). The German emission reductions occurred primarily in CO2 from households and services (-9.1 million tonnes) and CO2 from public electricity and heat production (-3.9 million tonnes), whereas CO2 emissions from iron and steel production increased by 5.4 million tonnes. Danish and Finnish emission reductions are mainly due to CO2 from electricity and heat production (-6.0 and -3.7 million tonnes respectively) which reflects higher hydro power production in the Nordic electricity market. Figures and tables The following figures and table give details, for the EU-15, of trends in emissions of the six greenhouse gases up to 2004. Emissions from international aviation and shipping, and emissions from/removals by land use change and forestry, are not covered. Figure 1: Total EU-15 greenhouse gas emissions in relation to the Kyoto target (source: European Environment Agency, 2006) Notes: The linear target path is not intended as an approximation of past and future emission trends. It provides a measure of how close the EU-15 emissions in 2004 are to a linear path of emissions reductions from 1990 to the Kyoto target for 2008-2012, assuming that only domestic measures will be used. Therefore, it does not deliver a measure of (possible) compliance of the EU-15 with its GHG targets in 2008-2012, but aims at evaluating overall EU-15 GHG emissions in 2004. The unit is index points with base year emissions being 100. GHG emission data for the EU-15 as a whole do not include emissions and removals from LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry). In addition, no adjustments for temperature variations or electricity trade are considered. For the fluorinated gases the EU-15 base year emissions is the sum of Member States' emissions in the respective base years. 13 Member States have chosen to select 1995 as base year under the Kyoto Protocol, Austria and France have chosen to use 1990. Therefore, the EU-15 base year estimates for fluorinated gas emissions are the sum of 1995 emissions for 13 Member States and 1990 emissions for Austria and France. The Kyoto target is a five-year average target. This is the reason for plotting the latest five-year average available (2000-2004) in addition to the GHG emission trends 1990-2004. Table 1: Greenhouse gas emissions trends and Kyoto Protocol targets for 2008-2012 (source: European Environment Agency, 2006) The base year emissions in this table are preliminary and the final emissions will be agreed in 2006 within Council Decision (2002/358/EC). The base year for CO2, CH4 and N2O, for the EU-15-15, is 1990; for the fluorinated gases 13 Member States have chosen to select 1995 as the base year, whereas Austria and France have chosen 1990. As the EU-15 inventory is the sum of Member States' inventories, the EU-15 base year estimates for fluorinated gas emissions are the sum of 1995 emissions for 13 Member States and 1990 emissions for Austria and France. Malta and Cyprus did not provide GHG emission estimates for 2004, therefore the data provided in this table is based on gap filling. Note: Malta and Cyprus do not have Kyoto Protocol targets.

The report, 'Air pollution by ozone in Europe in summer 2005' says that Southern Europe was worst hit. Portugal experienced the highest one-hour ozone concentration, and dangerous levels were also recorded in Greece, Italy, France, Romania and Spain. However, the number of times the ozone level went into the red in the summer of 2005 was significantly lower than in the years between 1999 and 2003.

Increasing the use of renewable energies offers significant opportunities for Europe. Securing energy supply and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are two of the most obvious. Europe can produce sufficient bioenergy to meet its renewable energy target without harming the environment. However, this requires an appropriate policy framework according to the new EEA report entitled, 'How much bioenergy can Europe produce without harming the environment?' released today by the European Environment Agency (EEA). Biomass - organic matter that can be used to create electricity, heat and fuel for transport - currently provides two thirds of the renewable energy produced in Europe today. On the other hand, if badly managed, increased production of bioenergy may intensify farming and forestry, impacting upon biodiversity and soil and water resources. The EEA has developed a number of environmental criteria to minimise additional environmental pressures from bioenergy production. Based on these criteria, the environmentally-compatible bioenergy potential for the EU-25 for 2010, 2020 and 2030 has been calculated. The report, which did not analyse costs and logistics, finds that Europe could actually produce 190 Mtoe (million tonnes of oil equivalent) of bioenergy, in an environmentally viable fashion, by 2010. This could reach almost 300 Mtoe by 2030. However, it is crucial that Europe manages any proposed rise in the production of biomass in line with other community policies and objectives aiming to protect biodiversity and reduce waste. The report calls for the implementation of environmental guidelines at local, national and European level to achieve this. There are also possibilities for synergies between the large scale production of bioenergy and the environment. For example, innovative bioenergy crops such as perennial grasses as well as short rotation forestry can combine high yields with relatively low environmental pressures. They can even be beneficial as they add to the diversity of landscapes, the report says.

Forests are recovering, but Europe's biodiversity is still under pressure The condition of forests is improving and some freshwater species are returning, but Europe still has a long way to go in safeguarding its plant and animal species, according to the EEA report 'Progress towards halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010.' released today. The report covers Europe's main ecosystems: farmland, forests, wetlands, mountains, marine and freshwater. It looks at policies affecting biodiversity and reviews progress towards the 2010 target of halting the loss of biodiversity in the EU. Considerable progress is being made for forest ecosystems, and, to a lesser extent, freshwater and wetlands. Water quality in many of Europe's rivers is improving. As a result, some species, such as the common otter and the salmon, are returning to their former habitats in England, Scotland, Denmark and Latvia, the report says. However, farmland habitats, mountain regions and marine ecosystems are not doing as well. Farmland biodiversity has declined seriously in the past decades, and there are few signs of recovery. Bird numbers, for example, have plummeted by a third since 1980. The farmland bird population is a key figure, as birds feed on insects and plants, and are thus considered a good barometer for the general state of biodiversity within farmland eco-systems. The continuing expansion of intensively-farmed areas at the expense of natural and semi-natural habitats is particularly worrying. The report shows that building the Natura 2000 network has boosted the designation of protected areas in the EU. However, land use changes, eutrophication and acidification, climate change and biotechnology continue to be of general concern with regard to Europe's biodiversity.

While greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors decreased, those from transport increased in the EEA countries by more than 22 % between 1990 and 2003. Ireland has experienced an increase of 130 % in greenhouse gas emissions from transport - excluding aviation and maritime - a reflection of its economic growth. Germany, on the other hand, has experienced only a 5 % increase, consistent with its economic experience, the report says. Air passenger transport grew at the fastest rate (96 % between 1990 - 2002), while the share of road and rail remained constant. Relative decoupling of growth in freight transport volumes from economic growth has only been achieved in the EU-10 group of new Member States, where transport volumes grew less than the economy as a whole. Relative decoupling of passenger transport volumes has been achieved in the last six years for which data is available for the EEA countries as a whole, but not for all member countries every year. \"Transport, especially road transport, is becoming cleaner because of increasingly strict emission standards and improved technology. However increases in demand continue to outstrip positive innovations. We are locked into patterns that are not easily changed in the short term. Long term policy initiatives are needed to encourage people to change their habits,\" says Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. Transport is not the only reason for poor air quality. However by exposing people to emissions at street level it can have a serious impact on the health of the general public. Moreover, traffic is a significant source of emissions of fine and ultra-fine particles in cities and there is growing evidence that these particles have serious effects on health. The report foresees that many European cities will continue to fail air quality limits. Ozone incidents - when pollution interacts with sunlight to cause a high level of Ozone (O3) in the lower atmosphere - are frequent now, and air quality limits set for ozone in 2010 are widely exceeded already. The impacts on health are severe: estimates suggest that as many as 370, 000 people die prematurely every year in Europe due to air pollution. And while research into alternative fuels is important, use of so called 'bio-fuels', on a scale where it will significantly reduce total greenhouse gas emissions, will not be a reality for many years. In the meantime, transport will continue putting pressure on the continent's environment, the report says.

Fine or (PM10) Particulates: describes the fraction of airborne particulate matter that is less than 10 microns in size. Fine particles are of the greatest concern since they are capable of being easily transported over long distances on currents of air. Fine particles may also be drawn into the respiratory airways and the smallest particles can penetrate the very deepest parts of the lung. PM10 and other particulate matter may vary considerably in chemical and physical composition. The principal sources of these particles are combustion processes, including traffic and industry. Ozone is formed by a 'cocktail' of pollutants - nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds - which break down due to the action of sunlight, releasing highly reactive atomic oxygen (O) which reacts with atmospheric oxygen (O 2 ) to form ozone (O 3 ). At lower levels of the atmosphere Ozone is an irritant to the eyes and the respiratory system. About the European Environment Agency (EEA): The EEA is based in Copenhagen.

The report suggests more targeted policy to help preserve the Natura 2000 network of protected areas across Europe. Traditional 'extensive' or low intensity farming is essential for maintaining the high animal and plant diversity of these areas, the report says. CAP now includes a range of measures aimed at supporting better environmental management in agriculture and the report notes considerable progress in terms of integrating environmental protection into agriculture policy. \"However, in terms of protecting biodiversity, the pattern of CAP spending is not as good as it should be. Biodiversity suffers more where farming is intensive and fares better where farming is less intensive,\" says Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. The IRENA report also points out that the pattern of spending by Member States reveals that the majority of agri-environment funds are allocated or 'programmed' in areas of intensive farming, many of which are in the North of the continent. The environmental effectiveness of the CAP budget could be improved if Member States programmed more money to be spent in areas of less intensive farming, traditionally in the South. These regions have a higher share of Natura 2000 areas and 'high nature value farmland' which are threatened both by abandonment of farming or its intensification. To avoid these negative trends these regions could benefit from better targeted support from CAP. \"Protecting biodiversity is a top-level policy objective of the EU and the UN. It is important because it encourages the ecological stability of agro-ecosystems and because a variety of flowers, butterflies, birds and animals add to the natural capital of rural areas. CAP's agri-environment spending could provide more environmental benefit if it were targeted on areas of key importance for biodiversity,\" Professor McGlade said. The IRENA report is part of the wider IRENA project which assesses the link between agriculture and environment in the EU-15 on the basis of 35 agri-environment indicators. IRENA stands for \"Indicator Reporting on the Integration of Environmental Concerns into Agriculture Policy\" (see editor's notes). While the report notes considerable progress in terms of integrating environmental protection into the objectives of agriculture policy, it underlines the impact that farming continues to have particularly on soil and water resources. Agriculture is responsible for about 50% of water use in southern Europe and contributes about 50% of total nitrogen pollution in the rivers of the EU-15. Farming also emits 10% of total greenhouse gas emissions and 94% of ammonia emissions in the EU-15. The report stresses that a significant investment into data collection on key environmental issues, farm trends and the spatial distribution of policy measures is necessary for a proper evaluation of the CAP. Only then, will a full assessment of the impact of agriculture policy on the environment be possible. Notes to the Editor: The IRENA project This report is one of the outputs of the IRENA project. IRENA stands for \"Indicator Reporting on the Integration of Environmental Concerns into Agriculture Policy\". It is a joint exercise between several Commission Directorates-Generals including DG Agriculture and Rural Development, DG Environment, DG Joint Research Centre, Eurostat and the European Environment Agency. The project covers the 15 Member States that constituted the EU in 2002. It is a response of the European Commission to the request of the Agricultural Council made in 2001 to develop a set of agri-environmental indicators for monitoring progress towards the integration of environmental concerns into the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The 35 indicators produced are based on a wide range of data sources, collected at different geographical levels (national and regional), and generally cover the period from 1990 to 2000. They are presented in 'indicator fact sheets'. Further information on IRENA reports and results is available at: http://webpubs.eea.europa.eu/content/irena/index.htm Natura 2000 Natura 2000 refers to an EU network of sites designated by Member States to conserve natural habitats and species of wildlife which are rare, endangered or vulnerable in the European Community. The term Natura 2000 comes from the 1992 EC Habitats Directive, it symbolises the conservation of precious natural resources for the year 2000 and beyond CAP and the Environment The European Council in Helsinki (December 1999), adopted a strategy to integrate an environmental dimension into the CAP. The integration requirement implies an active pursuit of coherence and complementarity between agriculture and environment policies. Key Findings of the IRENA project Due to decreased livestock numbers and mineral fertiliser consumption, greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions from agriculture have declined by about 9 per cent since 1990. However, a continuation of these trends will not be enough to meet 2010 ammonia emission reduction targets. In 2002, the agricultural sector contributed around 10% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, mainly methane and nitrous oxide. Agricultural emissions of GHG fell by nearly 9% between 1990 and 2002, mainly due to a reduction of livestock numbers, the lower use of mineral fertilisers, and changes in farm management practices. Agricultural emissions of ammonia decreased by 9% during the same period. The agricultural sector still represented an estimated 94% of ammonia emissions in the EU-15 in 2002. The irrigable area within the EU-12 increased by 12 per cent from 1990 to 2000, mostly in Mediterranean countries where irrigation accounted for about 50 per cent of water use. The figure drops to approximately 7 per cent in Northern Europe. The majority of farmland birds suffered a strong decline from 1980 to 2002. This decline levelled off in the 1990s but species diversity remains at a low level in intensively farmed areas.

This involvement helped bring a specific Swiss expertise relevant to EEA working areas, and ensure pan-European coverage for EEA reporting activities With full membership, Switzerland will take part in the European Environment Information and Observation Network (EIONET), receive a seat on the EEA management board and contribute directly to the Agency budget. Swiss nationals will also be able to apply for jobs in the Agency, and Swiss companies compete for EEA contracts. Besides the EEA membership agreement, the Council also adopted an agreement for the participation of Switzerland in the MEDIA Plus and Media Training programmes; an agreement between the EU and the Swiss Confederation in the field of Statistics and a protocol to the Agreement for the free movement of persons from the new Member States.

The EEA, in collaboration with the European Commission (Directorate General for the Environment), established the network in 2004. Its main purpose is to act as early radar for new environmental policies, and provide advice on the economic aspects contained within policy. The Network is also intended to provide an economic connection to the scientific and research community, and advice is sought on developments in theoretical and applied economics relevant to environment issues facing the European Environment Agency, DG ENV and its partners. Meetings take place once or twice a year in Brussels or Copenhagen, and so far the Network has dealt with issues such as climate change policies and impact assessment. The focus of today's meeting is biodiversity, the cost of inaction and links between environment policy, innovation and competitiveness.

The report says that the Mediterranean's already precarious state with its fragile coastal regions, scarce water supplies, vulnerable coastal ecosystems and large scale natural risks is under severe stress from tourism and urbanisation. It warns both decision-makers and the general public about the cost of inaction and recommends viable, realistic solutions on designing a possible future for the Mediterranean's 430 million inhabitants.

The report, 'Greenhouse gas emission trends and projections in Europe 2005', also shows that projected emission cuts on their own will not be enough. The carbon that is being released will need to be offset in other ways, such as through the Kyoto mechanisms.\u00a0 The Kyoto Mechanisms are systems whereby carbon released in the developed world can be offset by investment in clean technology projects in other developed countries or developing countries where costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are cheaper. \"If all plans for reductions are achieved and the Kyoto Mechanisms are used, the EU 15 could actually hit a 9.3% reduction, which is 1.3 % better than the target \" says Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency.\u00a0 The nine Member States planning to use the Kyoto Mechanisms are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain. They have put aside a combined total of EUR 2,730 million over the period up to 2012 for obtaining emission allowances through the Mechanisms.\u00a0 \"To date, the policies in place need to be implemented to meet the challenge,\" says Professor Jacqueline McGlade, \"There is a low carbon future for Europe but to get there we need to use all the measures at our disposal: investment in renewables, more efficient use of energy and other resources, and the use of financial and legal measures.\" New policies (not yet included in the projections) include the Emissions Trading Scheme: an EU scheme whereby industries emitting C02 can buy emission reductions from other industries if those other industries can reduce emissions more cheaply. Promoting electricity from renewable energy in industry, transport, households and energy efficiency are also key policies. All ten new Member States are either on track to meet or over-achieve their Kyoto targets by 2010. In 2003 emissions were 32% below the 1990 figure. This was due mostly to the closure of heavily polluting and energy intensive industries in the 1990s. However, emissions are expected to increase between 2003 and 2010. Within the EU15, greenhouse gas emissions have dropped in energy production, industry, agriculture and waste. However, emissions from transport - mainly road transport - is now 24% higher than 1990 levels, and this figure is expected to grow to 31% by 2010. The rise in transport emissions is due to the growth in both passenger and freight transport. This has partly offset EU efforts, such as the 1998/99 agreement with European, Japanese and Korean car makers to reduce average CO2 emissions of new passenger cars. See report: \"Greenhouse gas emission trends and projections in Europe\", The EEA report also serves to support and complement the annual evaluation report on progress of the EU to the Kyoto targets, prepared by the European Commission to the Council and European Parliament. Notes to the Editor: Data Source The report is based on data and information submitted by the countries in May - June 2005 EU-15 emission trends 1990-2003 As presented by EEA in a report published in June 2005, by 2003 - the latest year for which complete data are available - greenhouse gas emissions had been reduced by 1.7% in the EU-15 compared with 1990 levels, EU Emissions Trading System The EU Emission Trading Scheme requires all large CO2 emission sources, such as steel, glass and power plants (more than 11.000 throughout the EU) to decrease emissions for 2005-2007 through trading\u00a0 emission allowances with companies where reductions can be done cheapest. So, for example, plants investing in energy savings, would produce lower emissions after the introduction of alternative clean technologies. They could then trade the surplus on their CO2 emissions allowance with companies that either find investing in emissions reduction too expensive or which need to produce greater levels of emissions due to growth. In 2006 'emission caps' - a maximum emissions level - for the trading sector will be set by governments for the Kyoto period. After 2006, companies needing to increase their CO2 emissions will either have to invest in new technologies or trade with other companies for the allowances.\u00a0 By 2006 the effects of the scheme for achieving the Kyoto targets will become clearer. Kyoto Mechanisms The Kyoto Mechanisms help developed countries contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and achieve their targets. They can also help to transfer clean technologies. This is done by cooperation with developing countries through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) or other developed countries through Joint Implementation (JI). This is done through projects which can reduce emissions for lower costs than those in the original countries. For example, the costs of CO2 reductions in a project, such as rural electrification using solar panels in a developing country, are lower than those costs in developed countries. Greenhouse gas reductions made in the developing country are then certified by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's CDM Executive Board\u00a0 and transferred to the developed country to be used as part of its commitment to the Kyoto targets. \u00a0 About the EEA The European Environment Agency is the leading public body in Europe dedicated to providing sound, independent information on the environment to policy-makers and the public.

Ten percent of Alpine glaciers disappeared during the summer of 2003 alone. At current rates, three quarters of Switzerland's glaciers will have melted by 2050. Europe has not seen climate changes on this scale for 5 000 years, says a new report by the European Environment Agency (EEA), based in Copenhagen. 'The European environment - State and outlook 2005', a five year assessment across 31 countries, provides an overview of Europe's environment and points to challenges of which climate change is just one. Other areas of concern include biodiversity, marine ecosystems, land and water resources, air pollution and health. For the first time, the report has a country by country analysis with performance indicators and comparisons for all of the participants: the EU-25 plus Bulgaria, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Romania, Turkey and including Switzerland. The report says Europe's average temperature rose by 0.95 \u00b0C during the 20th century. This is 35 % higher than the global average increase of 0.7 \u00b0C and temperatures will continue to rise. The EU has recognised this and set a target limiting the global temperature increase to 2 \u00b0C above pre industrial levels. 'Without effective action over several decades, global warming will see ice sheets melting in the north and the spread of deserts from the south. The continent's population could effectively become concentrated in the centre. Even if we constrain global warming to the EU target of a 2 \u00b0C increase, we will be living in atmospheric conditions that human beings have never experienced. Deeper cuts in emissions are needed', says Jacqueline McGlade, Executive director of the EEA. Past EU legislation on environment has worked, says the report. We have cleaned up our water and our air, phased out some ozone depleting substances and have doubled rates of waste recycling. We also have cars that pollute less; without the dramatic improvements made by catalytic converters over the past twenty years, certain emissions would have been ten times the level they are now. Yet, it has taken ten to twenty years for these actions to show results, the report says. These environmental success stories are now being overtaken by changes in personal consumption patterns. Europeans are living longer and more of us live alone putting greater demands on living space. Between 1990 and 2000, more than 800 000 hectares, of Europe's land was built on. That is an area three times the size of Luxembourg. If this trend continues, our urban area will double in just over a century. Managing urban sprawl is essential if we are to protect our natural resources, says the report. We travel further and more often and are consuming the planet's natural resources at twice the world's average rate. Transport is the fastest growing contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. For example, air travel is expected to double between now and 2030. As a result, we leave a clear footprint outside Europe, depleting natural resources and damaging the world's environment. Eurobarometer polls show that over 70 per cent of Europeans want decision makers to give equal weight to environmental, economic and social policies. To take these views into account, the report underlines that policy makers must work with each other at European, national and local levels. They must integrate environmental considerations across sectors such as transport, agriculture and energy and set up a framework within which individuals and business can take action. 'Policy makers must be farsighted. We need a gradual shift away from taxes on labour and investment towards taxes on pollution and the inefficient use of materials and land. We also need reforms in the way that subsidies are applied to transport, housing, energy and agriculture. We need subsidies encouraging sustainable practices and efficient technologies', says Professor McGlade. 'With the necessary incentives built in, such reforms will lead to more investment, innovation and competitiveness. We have already seen this in practice in certain countries and sectors. Strong taxation of petrol in Europe and high regulatory standards led to cars that have been almost twice as fuel efficient as cars on America's roads, in recent decades. We have seen the cost of inaction in terms of people's lives and our environment with examples such as the collapse of fish stocks, the use of asbestos in buildings, acid rain and lead in petrol. It pays to act now to secure the long term', says Professor McGlade. Notes to the editor: About the European Environment Agency (EEA): The EEA is based in Copenhagen. The agency aims to help achieve significant and measurable improvement in Europe's environment through the provision of timely, targeted, relevant and reliable information to policy makers and the public. As part of its mandate, the EEA provides a comprehensive review of the state of the European environment every five years. 'The European environment - State and outlook 2005' includes: An integrated assessment of Europe's environment with chapters on: Environment and quality of life The changing face of Europe Climate change Air pollution and health Freshwaters Marine and coastal environment Soil Biodiversity Environment and economic sectors Looking ahead A core set of indicators, which are a small number of indicators that are stable and which can be used to gauge policy effectiveness, such as progress towards the Kyoto targets. An example of a core indicator is greenhouse gas emissions. The indicators provide timely and relevant information on trends and movements taking place within the environment. A country by country analysis based on nine of the core indicators. The analysis provides a comparison of performance in a 'country scorecard', supported by information provided by the countries themselves. The country analyses were prepared in partnership between the countries and the EEA to provide additional country level perspectives on the scorecard analyses. The selection of indicators included in the scorecard is the responsibility of the EEA and does not necessarily reflect the priorities of the countries. To allow a deeper understanding of the issues at country level, some figures included here are from national sources and so may not be fully comparable with data compiled by Eurostat, the EEA or other international bodies.

Because people consume products and services, all of which require resources and generate waste, every one of us places demands on the Earth. Nature can keep up with these demands as long as they stay within the regenerative capacity of the biosphere, the living part of the planet. Ecological Footprint accounting measures the extent to which the ecological demand of human economies stays within or exceeds the capacity of the biosphere to supply goods and services. These accounts help individuals, organisations, and governments frame policies, set targets, and track progress toward sustainability. Such accounting is possible because resource and waste flows can be tracked, and most of these flows can be associated with the amount and type of biologically productive areas required to maintain them. The Footprint of a population is the total amount of biologically productive land and water area that the population requires to produce the resources it consumes and absorb the waste it generates, using current technology. Since people consume resources and ecological services from all over the world, their Footprint is the sum of these areas, regardless of where they are located on the planet. The Ecological Footprint can be applied at scales ranging from single products to households, organisations, cities, regions, nations, and humanity as a whole. The Footprint is used by governments, businesses, and organisations to measure and manage sustainability efforts, from communication and planning to implementation and evaluation of results. \u00a0 The 2005 Edition Ecological Footprint Accounts The development of the 2005 Edition of the National Ecological Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts was sponsored by the European Environment Agency. These new accounts have generated the most accurate Ecological Footprint results to date, which are now available through the year 2002. The greatest improvement since the previous edition has been the addition of detailed trade statistics, which allow us to more accurately track imports and exports of Footprint and biocapacity at the national level. These updated accounts are explained in more detail in the upcoming 2005 European Environment Agency publication \"Europeans use 2.1 Europes - how the planet and the world's largest economy interact.\" This report documents in detail the relationships between Europe and the world's ecosystems, and shows how social, political, and economic forces shape these relationships. It explores how Europe affects the global biosphere as a whole, and how actions external to its borders affect the health of Europe's ecosystems. The report also examines future policy choices and how these might influence the balance between Europe's supply of and demand on ecosystem resources, addressing what decisions made today may mean for the well-being of Europe's citizens tomorrow. Findings The Earth's biologically productive area is approximately 11.2 billion hectares, or 1.8 global hectares per person in 2002 (assuming that no capacity is set aside for wild species). Global hectares are hectares of biologically productive area with world-average productivity. This standardised measurement unit, or 'ecological currency,' makes comparisons of demand and supply possible across the world. In 2002, humanity's demand on the biosphere, its global Ecological Footprint, was 13.7 billion global hectares, or 2.2 global hectares per person. Thus in 2002, humanity's Ecological Footprint exceeded global biocapacity by 0.4 global hectares per person, or 23 percent. This finding indicates that the human economy is in ecological overshoot: the planet's ecological stocks are being depleted faster than nature can regenerate them. This means that we are eroding the future supply of ecological resources and operating at the risk of environmental collapse. More detailed results for EU-25 nations and over 120 other countries around the world are included in the attached data sheets. The Method's Development Created by William E. Rees and Mathis Wackernagel in the early 1990s, the Ecological Footprint methodology has matured considerably over the past twenty years. Development and standardisation of this accounting method are currently coordinated by Global Footprint Network, founded in 2003, and its 50 partner organisations.

It can also help companies develop their competitiveness and competitive markets, create and maintain jobs, and improve the health of the workforce and the wider public. The paper represents the result of work undertaken by the Network's Interest Group on Better Regulation chaired by Chief Executive of the Environment Agency of England and Wales, Barbara Young. The EPAs agreed to contribute to the debate by endorsing a joint statement which reviewed evidence from the World Bank, OECD, national governments and academics on the links between environmental regulation and competitiveness. The EPA Network is an informal grouping bringing together the heads of environment protection agencies and similar bodies across Europe to exchange views and experience on issues of common interest to organisations involved in the practical day-to-day implementation of environmental policy.

The report, which scans existing and emerging pollution issues, draws a picture at the regional level but also provides a profile for each Mediterranean country. As well as pollution from land-based activities and shipping, the report covers emerging threats to the region's ecosystem. These include the rapid expansion of aquaculture - the farming of shellfish and fish, the introduction of new species and continuous biological invasions by harmful algae blooms. Tougher legislation is needed to combat the environmental challenges facing the Mediterranean region. However, without the political will of the countries involved, existing and future legislation will remain ineffective, the report says. \"The Mediterranean, the biggest tourist destination on earth, is under a process of habitat destruction and physical alteration that might go beyond what we have observed. While the rate of exploitation of marine resources seems to have stabilised, the extent of the damage is alarming,\" says Professor, Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. \"The number one priority in environmental management in the Mediterranean region is to enforce the existing environmental legislation\", Professor McGlade says. The main problem in southern and eastern Mediterranean countries is the inadequate treatment of urban waste; a problem exacerbated by the growth in tourism. Here, there is a lack of technologies and economic conditions to deal with environmental issues. In the northern countries, the biggest issue is pollution from chemicals, the report says. \"The report could be used to focus on alternative policy options to help regional and national policy makers develop priority policy actions that would have a positive effect on the Mediterranean marine environment,\" says Paul Mifsud, Coordinator of UNEP/MAP. Mr. Mifsud stated that he is looking forward to the entry into force of the LBS Protocol - the most important regional legal instrument addressing land-based sources of pollution - at a time when new challenges are emerging, threatening the marine environment. All of the participating countries have prepared their National Action Plans aimed at gradually reducing and eventually eliminating pollution from land, Mr Mifsud said. These plans are expected to receive formal endorsement by the Contracting Parties in Portoroz.

The pilot study, 'Effectiveness of Urban Wastewater Treatment Policies in Selected Countries', analyses successes and failures in policy for Denmark, Estonia, France, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain. It explains the relationship between effective wastewater management and the policies behind them. Water pollution caused by 'untreated' wastewater continues despite three decades of efforts to clean up European surface waters. Several EU Member States have not satisfied the requirements of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD), originally adopted in 1991 to cut waste water pollution by 2000. The Dutch model, which is based on high water pollution levies and full costing of sewerage, comes close to satisfying the legislation and is the most cost-effective of the examples in the report. The report suggests that the absence of water pollution taxes in France and Spain will result in these countries failing to reach the 2005 targets cost-effectively. Denmark complies fully with the Directive, with discharges decreasing by 90%. \"The Dutch example shows the financial benefits of finding the 'upstream' solution to tackling waste water pollution rather than paying for clean-up at the end,\" says Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency. Both new Member States in the study, Poland and Estonia, have until 2010 to comply. However, both countries will need considerable EU support if they are going to hit the targets. In several member states water pollution control costs have absorbed more than 50% of all environmental investment in recent decades. New Member States are eligible for considerable EU subsidies (75-85% of cost) from EU Cohesion and Structural Funds. It is estimated that increased support of between 40-50 euro per person will be needed if these countries are to meet the deadlines. \"The risk is that the new Member States will be tempted to build treatment plants instead of taking the more cost-effective path of tackling the problem at source,\" says Professor Jacqueline McGlade. Report: Effectiveness of urban wastewater treatment policies in selected countries Brochure: Policy effectiveness evaluation Notes for Editors: EU Cohesion & Structural Funds: The Cohesion policy aims at reducing regional disparities in economic and social development in the European Union, by strengthening a harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of economic activities and the development of employment and human resources. The Cohesion policy absorbs approximately one third of the EU budget. Policy Effectiveness Evaluations: Policy effectiveness evaluation raises questions about environmental policies: Are policies working? Are they worth the money invested in them, and if not how can they be improved? The EEA has identified policy effectiveness evaluation as a priority area, aiming to measure and to demonstrate the results of policies in order to justify them against broader policy objectives, and thus to support informed decision making. With the aim of gaining practical experience in doing policy effectiveness evaluations and to provide support in selected policy areas, the EEA has carried out pilot studies on the effectiveness of packaging waste management systems, and on wastewater policies.

The 'Effectiveness of Waste Packaging Policies in Selected Countries' report analyses the performance of Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Italy and UK in terms of their compliance with the EU directive on packaging waste. The report evaluates each country's performance in relation to the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive, the key policy initiative in this area. The results show that the Directive has most impact where hard targets have been set. EU targets led to a marked increase in the recycling of packaging waste across all the countries studied. However, overall volumes of packaging waste actually increased in the countries by 7% between 1997 and 2001. In Ireland, packaging waste increased by 36%. The report suggests that the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive fails in its main objective because hard targets have not been set for the volumes of waste packaging created. \"Despite considerable success with recycling, policy in this area has some way to go. We need to step up the focus on waste generation. Targets would make policymakers and the public more aware that the ultimate goal is to avoid waste in the first place,\" says Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA. For recycling packaging waste, Austria comes out top in the league tables going beyond the Directive's targets. Similarly, Denmark and the UK have met their obligations. Ireland, the highest producer of packaging waste per person in the EU (214kg per person annually compared with 122kg in Austria), has nevertheless met its targets for recycling packaging waste.

Biofuels could cover but a small percentage. While hydrogen from renewable resources could play a role in the medium to long term, we can to some extent rely on technologies such as hybrid vehicles in the shorter term.

In her speech, Jacqueline McGlade noted that multi-causality and complexity were often neglected in research looking at connections between environment and health. This is due in part to the sheer complexity of these realities. 'Research however needed to address these complexities if it was to be realistic,' said. Jacqueline McGlade. She went on to add that the EEA planned to do further work on multi-causality and the burden of disease over the next two years in partnership with the JRC.

Day-to-day policy making usually addresses the immediate or short term needs of a society. Policy is often broken into segments such as: Transport, Energy, Agriculture, Environment and so on. PRELUDE suggests that future policy makers must take note of a complex mix of expected environmental changes, unexpected events and the societal responses to both. With the PRELUDE project, the European Environment Agency hopes to encourage longer term planning based on integrated policy making. Irrespective of the storyline behind each of the five scenarios, the key message of PRELUDE is that policy decisions impact on each other in ways that were not always intended. By taking an integrated approach, we start to build policies in one area that compliment policies in another. Based on input from key 'stakeholders' from across Europe, such as farmers, non-government organisations (NGO's), scientific researchers and policy makers, PRELUDE presents five future scenarios following the social knock-on effects of contrasting land use policy. However, while looking forward, we should also learn from the past. Historic precedent tells us that our future will be moulded by a mixture of human decisions and actions as well as a series of often unrelated events and pressures. The latter could be 'creeping changes' such as the cooling of the Atlantic Ocean's gulf stream or more spectacular 'surprises' such as a major ecological disaster. These events are difficult to predict but the chance is that something unexpected will happen. Because of PRELUDE's relatively short time span of 30 years, the basic assumptions on climate change are similar for all scenarios. In some, however, climate change causes major disasters, whereas in others it is more of a background phenomenon. Societal responses are consequently very different. In each scenario, factors, including demographic trends, spatial planning patterns, agricultural policy, climate change and other key driving forces, lead to changes in land use and land cover. This results in a range of impacts on, biodiversity, water quality, flooding, greenhouse gas emissions, soil erosion, and landscape identity. 'There is a severe energy crisis. Serious flooding is forcing people out of vulnerable areas and back into the rural landscape. Despite initial hardships, most people are learning to cope with the challenges. Community spirit is rediscovered as people struggle to rebuild their lives. Small scale farms, many of them organic, spring up. Government policy is changing to support this new lifestyle ...' The above scenario does not immediately spring to mind when we think of a future affected by severe environmental change. People bonding together and rediscovering a 'back to basic's' life in the countryside doesn't sound too bad. Will it happen? We don't know. Notes on PRELUDE The acronym PRELUDE comes from the longer project title: PRospective Environmental analysis of Land Use Development in Europe.

'The European Environment Outlook' report shows that, despite successes in some areas, the EU continues to face significant environmental challenges in terms of meeting its long term environmental commitments. In particular, targets in respect of greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and the use of alternative sources of energy for electricity generation, heat and transport are in danger of being missed. \"Our environment is a complex system. The changes we will experience are also complex with many contributory factors. Climate change is the most obvious dramatic change but increased tourism and, urbanisation are also pressures that our environment has to deal with. However, we must also consider demographics. An ageing more wealthy society with changing consumption habits will continue to make a huge impact on our future environment,\" says Professor Jacqueline McGlade, executive director of the EEA. For many environmental problems, legislation has successfully addressed the 'big polluters', but new concerns are likely to arise from individual consumption and diffuse sources of pollution associated with agriculture. \"Successful responses require policy-makers to continue to shift to more integrated approaches that provide a coherent response across key sectors. That means that policy makers in transport and agriculture, for example, must consider the combined environmental implications of their policies,\" says Professor Jacqueline McGlade. According to the report the EU seems to be on track to meet the targets set for a number of other issues, particularly for air pollution and nutrient emissions. Positive developments are also expected in other areas, for example a reduction in agricultural nutrient surpluses, and a relative decoupling of transport demand from economic growth. Background information The European Environment Outlook report assesses the environmental consequences of key socio-economic developments in Europe, particularly with regard to climate change, air quality, water stress and water quality. The projected developments in the report are discussed in the light of Europe's current policy targets as adopted in the European Union's Sustainable Development Strategy and the Sixth Environment Action Programme.

The idea of both the game and Kids-Zone on the website is to demonstrate that there are relations between environment and health, especially for children. It also shows how seemingly small, individual behavioural changes can have a major impact at European level. The central feature of Kids' Zone is the Eco-Agent. The visitor is invited to become an Eco-Agent. They are then sent out on missions within the areas: chemicals, transport, water, air and climate change. The visitor starts out as an agent-trainee and must gather knowledge and pass tests to finally become a fully fledged Eco-Agent. They can then compare themselves with other agents. The agent can pass tests to raise his/her score - as compared to the other Eco-Agents. Visit Honoloko at http://www.honoloko.com and Kids' Zone of the EEA website at: http://ecoagents.eea.europa.eu.

While political commitment to this has received much attention, there has been less focus on support for EPI from administrations. A new report from the Agency presents an overview of administrative culture and practices for environmental policy integration in Europe, including the EU-25, the candidate and applicant countries, the EFTA countries and the countries of eastern Europe, Caucasus and central Asia. The report builds on EEA's recent state of play review on environmental integration in Europe. To be effective, EPI has to be developed and implemented as a long term and continuous process. This underlines the importance of changing administrative cultures in order to institutionalise EPI and protect it from sudden change. Administrations ensure that policy goals continue to be respected, long after politicians have moved to other issues. The general picture that emerges from this review is one of a small but growing body of practice in getting commitments to EPI reflected in administrations. Various mechanisms are being employed in these efforts. Use of EPI mechanisms is highest in a small group of EU and EFTA countries, notably the Anglo-Saxon, Nordic (including the Netherlands) and German-speaking countries. Within this group, the UK, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands stand out as having made special efforts to imbed EPI in their administrations. The EEA's evaluation uses four questions to evaluate to what extent administrations reflect environmental policy integration in their daily work. - Do regular planning, budgetary and audit exercises reflect EPI priorities? In the Netherlands, Norway and the UK, attempts are made to use budgetary, planning and audit processes to support EPI. However even these countries have difficulties making it work. The greatest scope for making strategic processes work for EPI is in countries that emphasise strategic management initiatives, including new public management. Here, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK are amongst the frontrunners. Little has been made of the potential to use auditing systems to evaluate progress in relation to EPI. The UK is an exception, going even further by extending beyond a purely financial remit. - Are environmental responsibilities reflected in the administration's internal management regime? There is no evidence that EPI is included systematically within management systems. EMAS and similar systems could have a positive effect here. Countries do not seem to allocate responsibility for EPI in all departments and at all levels, though this is important for promoting EPI in administrations. Development of strategic bodies has, however, led to more senior persons being involved. Some restructuring has been done, with environment units now found in several countries' sectoral ministries. All countries have environment ministries, though in some countries these ministries also have other roles. It is hard to say if such models promote EPI. Programmes to build up capacity to cope with EPI are rare. Some countries have earmarked money for sector integration activities, but funding does not keep pace with new demands. Overall figures for investment in EPI have not been assessed. - Is there a strategic department/unit to guide and support EPI? Some countries, notably in the EU-15 and EFTA, have established new bodies to ensure that EPI is promoted at a strategic level, although these bodies are frequently dealing more with sustainable development strategies than EPI. Senior politicians are not always involved in these bodies on a continuous basis, and the bodies also seem to play a relatively passive role. A large number of advisory councils have also been created. Not all EU countries have strategic or advisory bodies, however, nor are there equivalents at the EU level. - Are there mechanisms to ensure environment/sector coordination and communication, i.e. between departments and between levels of governance? EPI communication and coordination mechanisms are rather widespread, and some countries have permanent networks to aid communication. Coordination and communication between levels of governance is a challenge, particularly the downwards communication and coordination in federal countries. Communication can be easier where the environment ministry has a decentralised structure.

Global and European action is needed to meet the challenge of ensuring that global temperatures will never rise more than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This commitment to take the lead towards a \"low emissions future\" was agreed by all countries in the European Union. Serious consequences of climate change already include more frequent and more costly floods, droughts and other extreme weather events that are affecting water resources, ecosystems, agriculture and human health. Europe cannot achieve this goal alone. The report has looked at a contribution that would require a fall in EU greenhouse gas emissions by 40% of 1990 levels by 2030. The report projects substantial changes in the EU energy sector by 2030. The sector is currently responsible for 80 % of all EU greenhouse gas emissions. More than half of the reductions required in the EU would be based on achievable technologies inside Europe, meaning more efficient electricity and heat generation and use of energy in households, industry, services/agriculture and transport, a switch to low-carbon fuels and increases in renewable energy mainly from wind and biomass. The remaining reductions would be achieved by international emissions trading involving the rest of the world. These are the key findings revealed in a new report launched today by the European Environment Agency. The report sets out a number of scenarios assessing what changes would be needed to ensure a low global emissions future at the lowest cost. Professor Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA says: \"Climate change is at the top of the international agenda and many people are now aware of the Kyoto Protocol. But the Protocol is only a first step and the discussions have started as to what we do after 2012 to ensure that we do not exceed the two degree limit. In Europe we know that we cannot do it alone, but our political leaders have reaffirmed their commitment to global leadership on this issue and the Agency has now mapped out possible pathways to delivering on this political commitment. Europe needs to remove environmentally harmful subsidies on energy, improve its energy efficiency and increase its share of renewable energy. It also needs to help develop an efficient global emissions trading market. Europeans need to transfer clean technology to developing countries and invest in more research and development in clean technology. All these actions are required, if we want to meet our political commitment\", says Jacqueline McGlade. The EEA scenario study Modest total greenhouse gas emission reductions since 1990 were the result of a combination of one-off structural changes and specific policies and measures. Since 2000, CO2 emissions in the 15 pre-2004 EU Member States (EU15) have been rising. On present policies, this rise will continue after 2010 with a projected overall 14% rise above 1990 levels by 2030. Various climate action scenarios analysed by EEA would see EU greenhouse gas emissions reduced by 40% by 2030. More than half of these reductions would be based on achievable technologies within Europe while the remaining reductions would be achieved by international emission trading abroad in an effective global emission trading market. The EEA report underlines that an alternative energy system, with energy-related domestic CO2 emissions in 2030 that are 11% below 1990, is within reach if the EU: Improves energy efficiency, particularly in households, services and industry. These are expected to account for almost half of the emission reduction in 2010. Towards 2030 their contribution will decrease to about one third. Changes the way it generates energy. Towards 2030 more than 70% of the CO2 emissions reductions are expected to be achieved in the power generation sector due to a shift to low-carbon or non-carbon fuels. The use of solid fuels is expected to decline substantially and of natural gas to increase rapidly. Combined heat and power will increase its share of electricity production. Removes environmentally harmful subsidies to fossil fuels. Subsidies to energy in the EU-15 were EUR 29 billion in 2001, with 73 % oriented towards the support of fossil fuels. Invests instead in renewable energy sources and sets targets for renewables. In particular wind power and biomass use are expected to increase their share in primary energy sources. Explores new technologies for carbon capture and storage, which can serve as a transition technology towards a low-carbon energy system. Increases research and development in clean technology, for example in hydrogen fuel cells. Raises awareness among the European public, as well as European business, on the contribution they can make in their lives to reduce the energy intensity of the economy. A scenario with larger increases in renewable energy (almost 40% of electricity generation) shows a higher reduction in energy-related domestic CO2 emissions in 2030 of about 21% below 1990. Under all scenarios explored by the EEA, the transport sector still remains a difficult area in which to reduce emissions. CO2 emissions from transport are projected to continue to grow under all scenarios (to 25-28% above the 1990 level by 2030) because of the steady increase in passenger and freight demand. The EEA also explored the costs involved in converting Europe to a low-carbon energy system. Many early initiatives in energy efficiency in the household and service sectors may have low or even negative costs. But significant moves away from fossil fuels could represent an increased cost of about 0.6% of GDP by 2030. However, there is increased evidence that benefits of limiting global temperature increase to 2\u00b0C in terms of avoiding damage from climate change throughout the world, outweigh the costs of measures to reduce emissions. Furthermore a European low-carbon energy system is expected to result in additional ancillary environmental benefits such as a reduction of emissions of air pollutants, enhanced security of supply, and potential beneficial effects for employment. There is a need for further analysis of the macro-economic and sectoral costs and of costs of inaction. Substantial low-cost emission reductions are also projected for nitrous oxide and methane emissions from industry, waste management and agriculture. EEA will publish further details of the underlying scenario assumptions and results during 2005. Notes to the editor Climate change targets The Kyoto Protocol, which entered into force in February 2005 controls industrialised countries' emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20), plus three fluorinated industrial gases: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Under the Kyoto Protocol the 15 Member States of the EU (before 2004) agreed to reduce emissions by 8 % from base year levels by 2008--12, and different emission limitations or reduction targets for each Member State, the \u2018burden-sharing' agreement. The new Member States (except Cyprus and Malta) which joined the EU in 2004 have their own reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol, ranging from 6 to 8 % from their base year levels. All ratifying industrialised countries taken together are committed to an average reduction of 2.8 % by 2008--12 (from the 1990 level). These countries represent about 64 % of total emissions from industrialised countries, since the US and Australia have not ratified. To minimise adverse effects, the EU, in the sixth environment action programme (2002), defined an indicative long-term global temperature target of not more than 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Temperature around the world is already about a third of the way to this target. The EU Environment Council meetings of 20 December 2004 and 11 March 2005 both reaffirmed the temperature target. The Council translated this ambition level into global emission reduction targets as follows. The Council meeting of 20 December 2004 concluded: \u2018stabilisation of concentrations well below 550 ppm CO2 equivalent may be needed and global GHG emissions would have to peak within two decades, followed by substantial reductions of the order of at least 15 % and perhaps as much as 50 % by 2050 compared with 1990 levels'. The reductions required through the Kyoto Protocol, for 2008-2012, are thus a first small but vital step towards further global emission reductions. The share of EU25 emissions in global emissions is expected to be reduced to less than 10% by 2050 while the share of emissions from other, including developing, countries will increase. Thus further action to reduce emissions is needed by all countries, both industrialised and developing, on the basis of the UN Framework Convention's principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Furthermore the EU Environment Council of 11 March 2005 concluded that: 'the EU looks forward to exploring with other parties possible strategies for achieving necessary emission reductions and believes that, in this context, reduction pathways by the group of developed countries in the order of 15--30 % by 2020 and 60--80 % by 2050 compared with the baseline envisaged in the Kyoto Protocol should be considered'. The EEA report analysed a global emission decrease to 15 % below the 1990 level by 2050, which is within the range mentioned by the Environment Council. However further research is needed to better quantify the required global emission reductions. The EEA report further assumed EU emission reduction targets of 20 % below the 1990 level by 2020, 40 % below by 2030 and 65 % by 2050. These assumed targets are within the ranges mentioned by the EU Environment Council.

Emissions in the 15 old member states (EU-15) increased by 53 million tonnes (1.3%) between 2002 and 2003.Total EU-25 emissions increased by 1.5%, says the latest annual report on greenhouse gas emissions from the European Environment Agency. Between 2002 and 2003 EU-15 emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), which makes up over 80% of all EU-15 greenhouse gas emissions, increased by 59 million tonnes (1.8%). Since 1990 CO2 emissions in the EU-15 have increased by 3.4%. The emission increase in 2003 was mainly caused by an increase in power production using coal. The colder weather in the first quarter in several EU countries, also contributed to an increased use of fossil fuels to heat homes and offices. Still, since 1990, the base year of the Kyoto Protocol, greenhouse gas emissions in the EU-15 have decreased by 1.7%. Five-year average emissions between 1999 and 2003 are currently 2.9% below the base year emissions. Since 2003 a number of EU and national policies and measures have been implemented, which will help progress towards the Kyoto target. The EU emissions trading scheme launched on 1. January 2005 is expected to result in further cuts in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the coming years. In addition, some member states are starting to take advantage of other options for reducing emissions that are available under the Kyoto Protocol. These options allow countries to achieve part of their targets by investing in emissions-saving projects in other countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, or by undertaking projects that sequester CO2 in forests or agricultural land. New projections of future emissions by member states should become available over the coming months. Report: Annual European Community greenhouse gas inventory 1990-2003 and inventory report 2005 European Commission press release (IP/05/767) on the report: http://europa.europa.eu/rapid/setLanguage.do?language=en Notes for the editor Changes in greenhouse gas emissions in EU-15 - sectors The overall 53 million tonnes increase in EU-15 emissions between 2002 and 2003 reflected higher greenhouse gas emissions from energy industries (+24 million tonnes or 2.1%), mainly due to a 5% growth of thermal power production and a 5% increase of coal consumption in thermal power stations. The increase in thermal power production was driven by higher electricity consumption (+3%). The largest emission increases from electricity and heat production was in the UK (+10 million tonnes), Finland (+7 million tonnes), and Germany (almost +6 million tonnes). Substantial increases of coal consumption were the main reason. Greenhouse gas emissions from households and the services sector increased considerably (+18 million tonnes or +2.8%), partly due to colder weather in first quarter of 2003. Emissions from industry increased by 17 million tonnes (+2.1%) which was mainly due to higher emissions from iron and steel production as well as refrigeration and air conditioning. Transport emissions increased by 6 million tonnes (0.7%) between 2002 and 2003. Germany reduced emissions from road transport for the fourth consecutive year which partly offset emission increases from that sector in other EU-15 Member States. Emissions in the agriculture sector decreased mainly due to declining number of cattle and lower emissions from agricultural soils. Other reductions were achieved for fugitive emissions from coal mining and from natural gas. Emission from the waste sector has decreased due to increased methane recovery and less waste land filled. Changes in greenhouse gas emissions in EU-15 - Member States Between 2002 and 2003, Italy, Finland and the United Kingdom saw the largest emission increases in absolute terms (15 million tonnes, 8 million tonnes and 7 million tonnes respectively). Italian emissions increased mainly from households and services by 6 million tonnes (+8%) and from manufacturing industries by 5 million tonnes (+6%), in particular in iron and steel and cement production. In the UK, emissions from public electricity and heat production increased by 10 million tonnes (+6%) due to a strong increase of coal consumption in thermal power stations (+12%). In addition, emissions from manufacturing industries increased by 4.5 million tonnes (+5%). These emission increases were partly offset by declining emissions in household and services and coal mining. The increase of emission in Finland was driven by a +7 million tonnes (27%) of CO2 from electricity and heat production. This was mainly due to a 45% increase of coal and peat combustion in thermal power plants. Declining electricity imports and hydropower production combined with a sharp increase of electricity exports were driving the thermal power production in Finland. In total Finland's emission increased by 10.8% from 2002 to 2003. Between 2002 and 2003, Denmark and Austria also saw large relative increases in their emissions, +7.3% and + 5.9% respectively. The main reason for the large emission increase in Denmark was an increase in electricity exports associated with a sharp increase of coal consumption in thermal power production. In Austria, the main factors were low hydro power production (which was offset by thermal power production), a further large growth in road fuel sales and comparatively cold temperatures in the first quarter. On the positive side, 2003 saw emission reductions from Portugal (-4.5 million tonnes or -5.3%) and Ireland (-2 million tonnes or -2.6%). In Portugal a sharp increase in hydropower production was a main reason. In Ireland, the decline is the result of a number factors, including the closure of Irelands only nitric acid plant and its associated ammonia production facility, CO2 reduction in electricity generation through the greater use of cleaner fuels and continued decreases in CH4 and N2O emissions in agriculture. Figures and tables The following figures and table give details, for the EU-15, of trends in emissions of the six greenhouse gases up to 2003. Emissions from international aviation and shipping, and emissions from/removals by land use change and forestry, are not covered. Figure 1: Total EU-15 greenhouse gas emissions in relation to the Kyoto target (source: European Environment Agency, 2005) Notes: The linear target path is not intended as an approximation of past and future emission trends. It provides a measure of how close the EC emissions in 2002 are to a linear path of emissions reductions from 1990 to the Kyoto target for 2008--2012, assuming that only domestic measures will be used. Therefore, it does not deliver a measure of (possible) compliance of the EC with its GHG targets in 2008-2012, but aims at evaluating overall EC GHG emissions in 2002. The unit is index points with base year emissions being 100. GHG emission data for the EC as a whole do not include emissions and removals from LUCF. In addition, no adjustments for temperature variations or electricity trade are considered. For the fluorinated gases the EC base year emissions is the sum of Member States' emissions in the respective base years. 13 Member States have chosen to select 1995 as base year under the Kyoto Protocol, Finland and France have chosen to use 1990. Therefore, the EC base year estimates for fluorinated gas emissions are the sum of 1995 emissions for 13 Member States and 1990 emissions for Finland and France. The Kyoto target is a five-year average target. This is the reason for plotting the latest five-year average available (1999-2003) in addition to the GHG emission trends 1990-2003. Table 1: Greenhouse gas emissions trends and Kyoto Protocol targets for 2008-2012 (source: European Environment Agency, 2005) The base year for CO2, CH4 and N2O is 1990; for the fluorinated gases 13 Member States have chosen to select 1995 as the base year, whereas Finland and France have chosen 1990. As the EC inventory is the sum of Member States' inventories, the EC base year estimates for fluorinated gas emissions are the sum of 1995 emissions for 13 Member States and 1990 emissions for Finland and France. Malta and Poland did not provide GHG emission estimates for 2003, therefore the data provided in this table is based on gap filling. Note: Malta and Cyprus do not have Kyoto Protocol targets.

Operational in Copenhagen since 1994, the EEA is the hub of the European environment information and observation network (Eionet), a network of around 300 bodies across Europe through which it collects and disseminates environment-related data and information. An EU body, the Agency is open to all nations that share its objectives. It currently has 31 member countries: the 25 EU Member States, three EU candidate countries - Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey - and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

There is however much scope to reinforce implementation and to improve evaluation and policy learning. This according to a new technical report - Environmental policy integration in Europe: state of play and an evaluation framework - released by the EEA. The integration of environmental concerns in sector and other policy areas emerged as a key element of EU environmental policy as early as 1973. Environmental policy integration has since been elevated to the Community Treaty. It is reflected in the G\u00f6teborg EU sustainable development strategy and the 6th environmental action programme. In its latest report, the EEA reflects on passed efforts at the national and EU levels, to promote environmental policy integration in order to help achieve sustainable development in Europe. The report, developed with support from the Institute for European Environmental Policy, takes stock of recent developments and outlines some of the opportunities and challenges lying ahead. In terms of policy, the EEA report points to a growing range of instruments being employed at EU and country level. Apart from environmental standards, funding programmes, spatial planning and research programmes, there is also a gradual move towards environmental taxes, environmental tax reform and other market-based approaches that seek to 'get the prices right'. Various forms of impact assessments have also been established, which are opening up and informing decision-making processes. However, much remains to be done. Improving coordination within and between different levels of governance warrants further attention, including ensuring there is sufficient capacity dedicated to environmental mainstreaming efforts. There is much scope to use regular government planning, budgeting and auditing exercises to push forward environmental and sustainable development objectives, be it at EU or national level. In the area of budgeting, good practice cases are emerging in Norwegian, Dutch and UK policy. Harnessing the EU's funding instruments has been particularly important, with funds increasingly diverted to environmental objectives, and subjected to environmental criteria, including cross-compliance mechanisms. How to monitor and learn from experience, particularly in terms of budgeting, remains a key question however. A particular gap from the EEA's perspective is the lack of a consistent evaluation and information framework. Although the EU's annual Spring Summits were to review progress, in practice environmental issues have been treated as secondary to the core issues of growth and competitiveness. To fill this monitoring gap, the EEA proposes a new common evaluation framework for environmental integration. The framework singles out six ingredients for success: political commitment, vision and leadership; administrative culture and practices; assessments and information for decision-making; policy instruments; monitoring progress; and the environmental context of EPI. With this framework the EEA aims to facilitate future evaluation efforts at national or at EU level.

European cities are particularly aware of the pressure on them to reduce traffic-related air pollution since new EU limit values came into force in January 2005 and many cities were found to regularly breach those limits. 'Tackling air pollution, particularly from road vehicles can be very cost effective', says Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency. 'Curbing the use of vehicles delivers many health and environmental benefits ranging from improved children's health, less accidents and noise, and reduced damage to plants, water and buildings.' In Germany, for instance, strategies to reduce emissions of air pollutants from transport-related sources are being explored at the local, regional and national levels. In particular, economic incentives are proposed for diesel cars with filters.

The question was posed by the renowned Brussels based think tank Friends of Europe at a round table debate during Green Week from 31 May to 3 June. Among the debaters was Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade from the European Environment Agency (EEA). She stressed the fact that European decision-makers, businesses and others working with fast growing economies should inspire and support developing countries not to make the same mistakes by setting and achieving high standards themselves. Everywhere demand for cars is increasing - a direct link with their prestige status over bicycles and public transport. Here, Europe should lead by example, anticipating such a predictable increase in cars by offering properly developed solutions to meet people's mobility needs. Urban planning procedures should also be properly integrated and designed to reduce the environmental problems coming from all the major sectors. There should also be a much greater effort to achieve interoperability in transport networks such as rail across Europe, to enable trains to use electricity for power instead of diesel. City authorities need to deal directly not only with people's transportation habits but also energy supply, land use, and housing preferences when planning for growth.

The kids' zone was developed in recognition of the need to reach younger audiences, in this case children aged 10 - 14, about the state and trends of Europe's environment. \"Education is about engagement. I would like to invite not only children, but also adults to make use of the features developed for younger audiences on our website to find out how we really can engage children in environmental issues\", says EEA Executive Director Jacqueline McGlade. The kids' zone was launched in June 2004 alongside Honoloko, a pc game for kids developed jointly by WHO and the EEA. The kids' zone was then in English only. Despite this, it has received about 60,000 visitors from all over the world. The kid's zone is now available in all 25 EEA languages (i.e. the official EU languages + Bulgarian, Icelandic, Norwegian, Romanian and Turkish). Later this year, Honoloko will also be available in 25 languages. The kids' zone aims to encourage European children to take good care of the environment and to create awareness of the environmental information provided by the Copenhagen-based Agency. The central feature of the kids' zone is the Eco-Agent. The visitor is invited to become an Eco-Agent, and is as such sent out on missions within the areas chemicals, transport, water, air and climate change. The visitor starts out as an agent-trainee and must gather knowledge and pass tests to finally become a fully fledged Eco-Agent and compare him or herself with other agents. The agent can pass tests to raise his/her score - as compared to the other Eco-Agents. The multilingual kids' zone was launched on 31 May during Green Week in Brussels.

There were representatives from agencies from 23 countries, as well as from the European Commission and the European Environment Agency. The Environmental Protection Agency of the United States was also invited to take part in the meeting. The meeting was hosted by the Environment Protection Agency of the Republic of Slovenia, who provided an overview of both the work of the Agency and the state of the environment of Slovenia at the start of the meeting. In the first session, the network discussed the Environment Sustainability Index 2005 Report with a brief introduction by EEA and two main contributions from Slovenia and Austria. A background paper 'What do standards have to do with Sustainability?\u0092 was provided by EEA. Participants expressed concerns on the quality of data, methodology and indicators that are used for the ranking of the countries, recognising, however, the value of benchmarking for the prioritising of resources and sensitising. The second session covered the area of Environment and Health. The EEA gave an overview of the work of the European Environment and Health committee steered by WHO and its activities towards implementing the Budapest declaration. The European Commission gave an overview of the Environment and Health Action Plan. Finally, the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States shared their experiences in the fields of air quality and presented case studies both in the field of collection of data on ozone and exposure. The following session covered the progress of work of the five interest groups. The interest group on agriculture agreed to continue its work. The interest group on better regulation will continue and include a dimension of public participation into the work. The interest group on sustainable use of natural resources will continue looking into the upcoming Thematic Strategy on the issue. A meeting will be held in Berlin in May. The work of the interest group on Climate change and adaptation will continue and meet during summer to prepare a discussion on post 2012 strategies. The interest group on Performance evaluation and best practice took stock of the experiences gained through the results that have been achieved until now and encouraged all members of the network to continue sharing experiences of best practices within the other interest groups. On the second day the network shared experiences on issues relating to the Aarhus convention. A background paper was prepared by EEA and a presentation was given by Italy on User requirements for Earth Observation. It was agreed that interested EPAs would reply to a questionnaire covering aspects of GEO and GMES developed by Italy. Slovenia presented their country\u0092s view. It was agreed to come back to further discussions on aspects of implementation of the Aarhus convention. The last session reviewed the aims of the network and the agenda for the next meeting. It was agreed that the network should remain informal, continue to focus on strategic issues linked to the practical implementation of EU legislation etc., and consist of heads of agencies and similar. The main plenary items for the next meeting are: For debate SOE and outlooks for Europe - Lisbon process, including scenarios for the future (EEA, Netherlands, Scotland, Italy and Finland); Better regulation - link to Lisbon (Interest group, lead England and Wales); For information Sustainable use of natural resources statement (Interest group, lead Germany) GMES and Inspire response to survey and questions on support from GMES in delivering information for monitoring and reporting (Italy, EEA) Host country Presentation of SOE and environmental governance in the Czech Republic The next meeting will be held in Prague on 29-30 September 2005.

To celebrate this occasion, the Agency teamed up with the Danish Zoological Museum, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and the Danish Biodiversity Information Facility in an open-day with guided tours at the Museum. The European Environment Agency introduced visitors to the EEA website and made available material on biodiversity with reports, videos and information - all available on the EEA website. On the occasion of International Biological Diversity Day, the European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity launched a much improved database called EUNIS, European Nature Information System. This database focuses on key biodiversity elements such as species, habitat types, etc and will be improved further during this year with major features such as spatial tools and enhanced data sets. These on-line information systems will help to assess and understand biodiversity in a wider context. The EUNIS database development was initiated by the Agency in 1997, and the data was made available on the web within European Community clearing House Mechanism process in 2002. Events were arranged worldwide to celebrate this day and improve awareness of biodiversity and its relevance to human well-being.

This is one of the main messages from the group of indigenous leaders, who are touring Europe to raise awareness on the impacts that warmer temperatures have on the people from the Arctic regions. Rising temperatures affect plants, animals and therefore food and hunting conditions. Also the melting of the permafrost is a threat to houses and infrastructure built upon it, said Chief Gary Harrison from Alaska, who represents the Arctic Athabaskan Council at a meeting in Denmark this week. He thanked Denmark and the other EU countries for taking a strong lead on climate change. \"We know there is some tough sledding ahead to make the rest of the cuts in greenhouse gases that will be needed. We came to let people know that climate change is already having an effect in the Arctic, and it will soon be affecting Europe too. It's really important that Europeans commit to more reductions once the Kyoto commitments are complemented.\" A recent report from the Copenhagen-based European Environment Agency confirms that changes in climate and impacts on nature and ecosystems are already underway in various parts of Europe, including the Arctic. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency: 'These findings provide even more evidence that climate change is really happening. Our report supports policy makers in their efforts to not only reduce emissions of greenhouse gases but also prepare ways to adapt to the changes that will inevitably come. Europe has a particular responsibility because of its leadership in the Kyoto process but also because its geography - from the Arctic to the arid regions of the Mediterranean - means that all Europeans will be affected.'

It is the home of about four million people, including more than thirty different indigenous peoples. Arctic peoples have much in common, but also maintain many different lifestyles, languages, and cultures. The Arctic is a region of vast natural resources and a clean environment, compared with most areas of the world. However, that environment is under threat from development within the Arctic, but more particularly from the effects of development in the rest of the world. The Arctic Council and the Permanent Participants The Arctic Council is an intergovernmental forum including Canada, Denmark (including Greenland and the Faeroe Islands), Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden and the United States. It was officially created by the Foreign Ministers of the eight Arctic states in 1996. The Arctic Council is primarily a regional partnership for sustainable development. The work covers three areas; the environmental, social and economic. The Council is a unique forum for co-operation between national governments and indigenous peoples. Six international organizations representing Arctic indigenous peoples have the status of Permanent Participants of the Arctic Council. The title of Permanent Participant gives indigenous peoples' representatives the status necessary to take a full part in the debates and work of the Arctic Council. The indigenous populations in the Arctic are represented by six bodies: Aleut International Association Arctic Athabaskan Council Gwich'in Council International Inuit Circumpolar Conference Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North Saami Council The Permanent Participants are assisted in their Arctic Council work by the Indigenous Peoples' Secretariat. From the beginning, Arctic governments and indigenous communities joined together to make environmental monitoring and assessment a key element of the Arctic Council's agenda. Scientifically based decision-making that is informed by the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples is a deeply rooted principle of the Council. Groundbreaking reports have been prepared and have attracted global attention to the state of the Arctic environment. The latest of these is the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment. The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) The assessment, released last winter, was the result of four years of closely examining scientific evidence and traditional knowledge of climate change in the Arctic.In much of the Arctic the impacts of global climate change are already being felt, as many peoples are experiencing warmer temperatures. Warming in the Arctic is expected to be faster and more severe than in the rest of the world What the authors of the ACIA expect to happen generally in the Arctic is an increase in temperatures of: 1\u00baC by about 2020 2\u00baC by about 2050 3\u00baC by about 2080 Ice cover, a critical component of the Arctic ecosystem, has been steadily diminishing over the past 30 years. Some scientific models say the Arctic will have no sea ice in the summer as soon as 2030. All of the effects in the Arctic will also affect the rest of the world, because the Arctic in a major driver of the world's weather. The warmer currents that modify winter weather in northern Europe may slow or even stop as a result of climate change. This would result in much lower winter temperatures in the north-western part of Europe. Amongst the people of the Arctic, indigenous peoples are particularly affected by the warming climate. Whether they still pursue traditional economies of hunting, fishing and gathering, or whether they participate in newer ways of life, indigenous peoples stand to be affected in ways that in some cases threaten the basis of their culture. Some species of Arctic wildlife are deemed by the assessment to be threatened with extinction. These include polar bears and some species of seal. This is particularly alarming for Inuit, many of whom still rely on seals as a basic food. Reindeer herders, such as Saami and some Russian indigenous peoples are at risk as climate change alters the pasture available for the herds. Increased winter freezing and thawing can lock forage for reindeer, caribou, and other large herbivores beneath a sheet of ice, resulting in increased herd mortality. Climate change is one more threat on top of many other challenges facing indigenous peoples in the Arctic, including accumulations of toxic chemicals, increasing development pressures, and the struggle to regain rights to land and self-government.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/Ann1116833942"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0797", "date": "2005-05-04", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Healthy environment - top priority for Europeans", "text": "For Europeans, a healthy environment is as important to their quality of life as the state of the economy and social factors, according to a new Eurobarometer survey.

The author of \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" and now \"Global Crises, Global Solutions\" was himself met with some stiff questioning by the Agency staff. Lomborg has made international headlines with his views on environmental policy and was the man behind the Copenhagen Consensus project last year - also the subject of his lecture. In this project, eight of the world's leading economists, with input from other experts, assessed how 50 billion dollars of extra money could be spent most cost-efficiently on major global challenges. On top of the resulting priority list of actions came fighting HIV/AIDS, providing food supplements and liberalizing trade - whereas actions aimed at limiting climate change came at the very bottom. During the discussion following his lecture, Lomborg was challenged on several points by EEA staff. The project was criticized for not taking synergy effects into account. The need to supplement the strictly economic perspective with other views when deciding what problems to address was also stressed. Even so, an informal poll by the end of the session indicated that around 30 % of those present in the packed auditorium thought it would be interesting to test the Copenhagen Consensus methodology on European environmental policy.

A new report shows that high technology has environmental potentials in Denmark, but that barriers have to be broken down and risks have to be handled. Non-toxic anti-fouling paint for ships, based on nanotechnology; enzyme-based pig fodder allowing reduced phosphorus discharges from pig farms; passenger cars running more than 20 km per litre. These are only three of a wide range of examples of environmental technology up for discussion on the conference hosted by the European Environment Agency and the Danish Ministry for the Environment. Connie Hedegaard, Danish Minister for the environment says: \"Growing CO2 emissions caused by energy production and more environmental problems from a growing number of animal husbandry are just two examples where economical growth will create bigger environmental problems if we do not use the right instruments. Therefore the fundamental challenge is to enhance the synergy between environmental protection, growth and new jobs. In Denmark we have actually shown that decoupling is not only a theoretical possibility - it is something that we can see in real life. Now we have to increase the list of real-life stories of smart eco-innovation.\" The conference takes place at the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen on 19 and 20 April. The Danish Minister for the Environment Mrs. Connie Hedegaard, and Executive Director of the European Environment Agency Prof. Jacqueline McGlade will be heading the conference. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade says: \"Environmental technology can decrease material inputs, reduce energy consumption and emissions, recover valuable by-products and minimise waste disposal problems. In order to map all these technological improvements, the agency has built a web portal which will allow all users to share best practices and assess progress within the sector of intervention, pollution management and resources management.\" In preparation for the conference, the Danish Ministry for the Environment has just presented a new report on the environmental aspects of nanotechnology, biotechnology and IT.

EPER is the first Europe-wide register of industrial emissions into air and water and was launched in February 2004. It makes detailed information on pollution from around 10,000 large industrial facilities in the EU and Norway publicly accessible on the internet for the first time. The European Information Association awarded EPER first place in its Electronic Sources Category, recognising it as the best of a large number of electronic publications, databases and websites produced at European level in 2004. Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said: \"EPER enables European citizens to exercise their 'right to know', allowing them, for example, to see how much pollution large industries in their neighbourhoods generate and to compare this with the situation in other parts of Europe. We are proud that our efforts to collect and disseminate this information have been rewarded by the European Information Association.\" Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA, added: \"EPER is a milestone in the provision of information to the European public about their immediate environment. The European Environment Agency plans to build on this by creating an extensive internet portal to regional and selected local environmental information covering the complete area of the Agency's 31 member countries by 2008.\" What is EPER? EPER 2004, the European Pollutant Emission Register, is the first Europe-wide register of emissions into air and water from large and medium-sized industrial installations, including pig and poultry factory farms. It covers 50 different pollutantsand comprises data from the 15 \u2018older' EU Member States as well as Norway and Hungary, which participate on a voluntary basis. The EPER website is hosted by the EEA in Copenhagen. In close cooperation with the Commission, the EEA has managed the process of collecting the data for EPER from the countries and has been involved in the design and development of the website. Since its launch the EPER website, http://www.eper.cec.europa.eu/ has registered 230,000 visits. What is the European Information Association? The European Information Association (EIA) is an international body of information specialists whose aim is to develop, co-ordinate and improve access to EU information. Registered as a charity in Britain, the Association seeks to help improve the quality of EU information through lobbying and the annual EIA Awards. More information is available at http://www.eia.org.uk. Next steps The Commission plans to translate the EPER website into every official language of the EU. French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Greek will be included in May 2005. Others will be added when emissions for 2006 are reported by all 25 Member States. The EU also intends to ratify the UN-ECE Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs) under the Aarhus Convention. As a result, EPER will be upgraded to a fully comprehensive European PRTR that gives the public more information, for example on what industries do with waste. The Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on the establishment of the European PRTR on 7 October 2004.

This is one of the conclusions of the newly published Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, the most comprehensive global survey of the state of our planet. The report states, that humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and extensively in the past fifty years than ever before. The lifestyle that followed World War II led to enormous changes. For example, more land was converted to agriculture since 1945 than in the 18th and 19th centuries combined. A quarter of the planet is now under cultivation. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is the result of four years of work involving around 1,400 experts from 95 countries. The exercise, which cost 24 million euros, aims to analyse ecosystems in order to ensure, that human beings will benefit from natural resources also in the future. 'We have a tendency to dismiss pessimistic scenarios, but thinking ahead often motivates us into actions that prevent disastrous consequences. And actions are necessary' says Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the European Environment Agency and a contributor to the report. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade describes the report as a very powerful consensus about the current unsustainable direction of many of our ecosystems: 'In contradiction to what environmental sceptics often say, this report definitely confirms, that technology alone will not solve all problems. Even in the best case scenario, irreversible consequences are expected, and these can have serious local and global impacts', says Prof. Jacqueline McGlade. She points out that the future is in our hands: 'It is possible to create a more balanced planet for our grandchildren. We need to combine strong political commitments, better environmental awareness, environmental friendly technologies, and higher prices for exploiting natural resources'.

Airparif is in charge of air quality monitoring in and around Paris and has made a considerable effort to make its information publicly available through the web. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade says that Airparif's public information service is among the very best of its kind in Europe. Partly for this reason, Airparif is seen as an excellent partner for the EEA in connection with the Agency's growing In Your Neighbourhood project, that will enable people to find information about their local environment through a map-based internet service. Airparif director Philippe Lameloise confirms that though the concrete details need to be fleshed out, the organisation is very positive about developing such an information-sharing cooperation with the EEA. See for more information on air quality monitoring in and around Paris: http://www.airparif.asso.fr/ Airparif presented their air quality information system at a workshop on real time air pollution data exchange and forecast in Europe held on 7-8 April 2005 (at EEA). This successful first joint EEA/EUMETNET workshop attracted about 50 participants, from National Meteorological Services (NMSs), National Environmental Agencies (NEAs), the European Environment Agency (EEA) and its European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change (ETC/ACC), the European Commission (DG Environment and JRC), EUMETNET (Working group on environment), GEMS (Global Earth-system Monitoring using Space and in-situ data), PROMOTE (PROtocol MOniToring for the GMES Service Element) and various regional/local organisations. Also the US Environmental protection agency (US EPA) participated. The workshop agreed on the the need for improved up-to-date information on air pollution for the public and for data exchange on real time monitoring and forecasting at the European level. EUMETNET and EEA will jointly prepare a proposal for a plan for a European real time and forecasting information network, incorporating the main conclusions from the workshop and building on existing systems.

Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director at the Agency is determined to respond to the results of an independent survey that she herself commissioned on whether many of the Agency's reports actually have the desired impact on policy-makers in Brussels and in all member countries. 'The results of this first survey were not exactly flattering, although I was pleased that the experts at the Agency were widely seen as accessible. Ensuring that we get feedback is a healthy exercise that I think every EU institution should do. We can all improve, and clear communication has traditionally not been one of the EU's greatest strengths' said Prof. Jacqueline McGlade. The two people, hired to strengthen the profile of the European Environment Agency have very different backgrounds, but both with communication as their core task. Paul McAleavey is a political scientist with a decade of experience in Brussels under his belt. Most recently he worked as political advisor to Margot Wallstr\u00f6m during her five years as European Commissioner for the Environment. Marion Hannerup has a journalistic background and comes from a job as executive director and editor in chief of an independent Danish newspaper for doctors and other decision makers in the healthcare sector. Before that she was for many years a news reporter and managing editor at Danmark's Radio's national television. 'We will be working closely together. You cannot really separate internal and external communications in an institution like ours. We need some time to get to know the EEA's working style and have already identified areas for improvement', says Marion Hannerup. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade is happy to have the two on board at last: 'It has been one of my biggest priorities to strengthen all communication aspects of the Agency. We want to become much better at hearing the needs of all our interest groups, to be able to provide them with the independent quality information that this institutions stands for. This will help us reach our ultimate goal, to improve the environment for all citizens of Europe.'", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/Ann1111481116"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0808", "date": "2005-02-16", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The Kyoto Protocol entered into force 16 February 2005", "text": "The entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol (See http://unfccc.int/2860.php)is an important milestone in international actions to combat climate change. It was welcomed by governments and many other interested parties around the world (See for example the European Commission: http://europa.eu.int/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/05/187)The EU believes climate change is a serious challenge to mankind and likely to have significant negative global environmental, economic and social implications. According to the UNFCCC, to avoid dangerous climate change, greenhouse gas concentration levels should be stabilised in future. To achieve stabilisation substantial reductions in global emissions of greenhouse gases are needed, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The emission reductions to be delivered by the implementaton of the Kyoto Protocol are an important first step. The recent EEA report on greenhouse gas emission trends and projections in Europe shows that the pre-2004 EU Member States (EU-15) could cut their total emissions to 7.7% below 1990 levels by 2010. Plans by six EU-15 Member States to use credits from emissions-saving projects in third countries through the Kyoto Protocol's \"flexible mechanisms\" would contribute a further reduction of around 1.1%, taking the total to 8.8%, sufficient to achieve the EU-15 target. See full report http://reports.eea.eu.int/eea_report_2004_5/en The European Commission adopted on 9 February 2005 a communication setting out future EU policies on climate change, reaffirming the EU's overall goal to keep human-induced global temperature rise to within two degrees Celsius. It includes a set of proposals designed to structure the future negotiations of the EU with its global partners over climate change policies after 2012 when the first commitment period under the Kyoto protocol ends. (European Commission press release) The recent climate change conference under UNFCCC, held in December 2004 in Buenos Aires, addressed the need to prepare for and adapt to the consequences of some inevitable climate change, complementary to mitigation policies aimed at reducing emissions. Such consequences are expected even with significant emission reductions over the coming decades, in both developing and developed countries. A recent EEA report shows current and projected climate change and its impacts in Europe. Examples are more frequent and more economically costly floods, droughts and other extreme weather; wetter conditions in northern Europe but drier weather in the south that could threaten agriculture in some areas; more frequent and more intense heatwaves, posing a potentially lethal threat to the elderly and frail; and, rising sea levels for centuries to come. The report concludes that also Europe needs adaptation strategies to limit impacts of climate change.

An almost overwhelming list of essential information to help society thrive in the 21st century. But at the heart of these extensive efforts are the real needs of citizens. Over the past 10 years, the European Environment Agency has provided information to policy makers, officials and researchers. In 2004, the Agency reached the attention of the general public through the launch of two products: the European Pollution Emissions Register - a tool to examine emissions of pollutants to air and water from nearly 10,000 industrial sites and Corine Land Cover 2000 -- the first digital map of the multiple changes that have occurred in Europe's landscapes since 1990. The immense response to both these products showed that there is an intense interest from the general public in gaining access to information about their local environment. What the public can see from the Corine data sets is a series of snapshots of the conflicts arising from the various European policies in agriculture, transport and regional development which are now potentially at odds with the sustainable development of Europe. Europe has been shaped by centuries of traditional farming practices, resulting in a wealth of different landscapes with high cultural and natural value. Landscape change is a relatively slow process, where small changes often go unnoticed but ultimately where the larger picture changes dramatically. Recent analyses by the EEA show that land is becoming a scarce resource: 800 000 ha of Europe's land cover was converted to artificial surfaces from 1990-2000. Only with careful spatial planning of urban and rural development can Europe avoid compromising its agricultural production, biodiversity, energy security and Kyoto targets and aspirations under the Lisbon agenda. As urban sprawl continues to spread into the countryside, and transport infrastructure, recreational and rural services take over agricultural and natural areas, the rights and freedoms of individual citizens will increasingly be put at risk. It is therefore essential that information on the environment both in real-time and over accumulated periods of time be freely available -- free at the point of delivery to citizens and policy-makers alike. Under the Aarhus Convention, a new EU Directive on public access to environmental information was adopted yesterday. This week's adoption of the 10-year implementation plan for Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) must therefore seek to do the same for Europeans at a global level. And in its turn, the EEA will continue to step up the release of useful data and products, free at the point of delivery, for the citizens of its member countries to better understand the future changes in Europe's changing landscape and environment.

The portal, developed and managed by the European Environment Agency, provides an entry point to information on technologies that are cleaner and more resource efficient and which can improve environmental monitoring. The portal was launched by former EU Commissioner for Environment Mr Yiannis Paleokrassas on behalf of the EU's current Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas. The site is a first step in implementing Action 4 of ETAP - Develop an EU catalogue of existing directories and databases on environmental technologies - by offering knowledge development support and eliciting the exchange of ideas and research results on eco-innovations. The portal functions as an environmental technology information facility. The system has been set up to enable anyone to publish web content via the portal suitably monitored for quality control. There are thirteen main technology categories covered; most of them are mentioned in ETAP. Environmental technologies can decrease material inputs, reduce energy consumption and emissions, recover valuable by-products and minimise waste disposal problems. The application of such technologies will enhance eco-efficiency, support the application of environmental management systems (both formal and less formal ones) and facilitates the identification of cleaner production equipment. The EEA is also interested in technologies that improve environmental monitoring and the gathering of information which can help in the identification of emerging issues, through remote sensing, biomonitoring etc. The portal was launched during Roundtable 3 of the conference where the Environment Technology Action Plan was discussed. The EEA presented the portal as well as progress in developing eco-innovation indicators. Methods are currently lacking to measure eco-innovation, which can supplement the European Innovation Scoreboard with environment related innovation indicators that can monitor progress over time and make comparisons between regions. The EEA is preparing a workshop on this topic for the autumn of 2005. The EEA will also host a conference on Eco-innovation in April organised in partnership with the Danish Ministry of Environment in collaboration with Ris\u00f8 National Laboratory (Denmark) and the Technical University of Denmark.

Latest projections compiled by the European Environment Agency show that the 15 pre-2004 EU Member States (the EU-15) should cut their total emissions to 7.7% below 1990 levels by 2010 on the basis of existing domestic policies and measures already being implemented and, more importantly, additional policies and measures currently planned. Plans by six EU-15 Member States to use credits from emissions-saving projects in third countries through the Kyoto Protocol's \"flexible mechanisms\" would contribute a further reduction of around 1.1%, taking the total to 8.8% (Annex). This is more than the 8% decrease from 1990 levels that the EU-15 has committed itself to achieving by 2008-2012 under the Protocol to combat climate change. Each of the EU-15 countries also has an agreed, legally binding target for limiting or cutting its own emissions to ensure the overall 8% reduction is met. But the projections show that at present Denmark, Italy, Portugal and Spain are on course for above-target emissions, some by a wide margin, even with use of the Kyoto mechanisms and additional measures planned. Germany is in danger of slightly exceeding its emission limit on the basis of existing policies and measures. This means the EU-15 may reach its 8% reduction target only if the projected failure of these Member States to respect their targets is compensated by others making bigger emission cuts than required. This \"over-delivery\" cannot be taken for granted. Without it, the EU-15 would achieve a total reduction, including use of the Kyoto mechanisms, of only 6.5%. On the more positive side, however, the projections do not take account of some important measures that should start to deliver emissions cuts over the next few years, such as the EU emissions trading scheme starting on 1 January 2005, or of plans to sequester carbon in \"sinks\" such as forests or agricultural land. This means actual emission cuts could be larger than projected. As the EEA reported in July, the EU-15 has so far cut its overall emissions of the six greenhouse gases controlled under the Kyoto Protocol to 2.9 % below 1990 levels (up to 2002, the most recent year for which complete data are available). Emissions decreased from most sectors, including energy supply, industry, agriculture and waste management. However, emissions from transport increased by nearly 22 % in the same period. The latest projections show that existing policies and measures -- concrete initiatives already being implemented at EU or national level -- will cut EU-15 emissions by only 1.0% below 1990 levels by 2010, or by just 0.6% if Sweden and the UK do not over-deliver on their targets. The runaway increase in emissions from transport, especially road transport, is the main reason the projected reduction is not bigger. Additional policies and measures currently in an advanced stage of planning would take the emissions reduction to 7.7%, provided that six Member States over-deliver on their targets: Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Sweden and the UK. Without over-delivery the cut would be only 5.4%, however. Two of the Protocol's flexible mechanisms, Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism, allow industrialised countries to invest in emissions-savings projects in third countries and use the resulting emission credits to help meet their Kyoto targets. Plans by Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to make use of this possibility are projected to yield an additional emissions reduction of 1.1%. Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden have already budgeted a total of around 1.3 billion euro for using the mechanisms over the coming years, though Finland and Sweden have not yet decided whether to use them or not. Together with the expected effects from both existing and additional policies and measures, use of the mechanisms takes the total projected EU-15 emissions cut to 8.8%, assuming over-delivery by some Member States, or 6.5% with no over-delivery. Plans by nine of the EU-15 Member States for sequestering carbon in sinks are projected to contribute an emissions reduction of around 0.7%. However, this has not been included in the aggregated projections because not all Member States have used an accepted methodology for making such estimates. The EU-15 target does not apply to the 10 Member States that joined the EU on 1 May this year. Under the Protocol most of these have their own reduction targets of 8% (Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovak Republic and Slovenia) or 6% (Hungary and Poland) compared with a given base year (1990 or earlier). Cyprus and Malta have no targets. Almost all of the new Member States have seen their emissions decline substantially. In 2002, their combined emissions stood 33 % below the base-year level, mainly due to the introduction of market economies and the consequent restructuring or closure of heavily polluting and energy-intensive industries. However, greenhouse gas emissions from transport exceeded base-year levels by 12%. All new Member States except Slovenia project meeting or even over-complying with their Kyoto targets by 2010 on the basis of existing domestic policies and measures, even though in most countries emissions will increase between now and then. Slovenia projects that it will achieve its Kyoto target with the help of additional policies and measures, including carbon sequestration from land-use changes and forestry. The latest projections are published in the EEA report Greenhouse gas emission trends and projections in Europe 2004. The report is published on the EEA website at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/eea_report_2004_5/en. A more detailed analysis by country and sector is published in the technical report Analysis of greenhouse gas emission trends and projections in Europe 2004 published on the website at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/technical_report_2004_7/en. Note to Editors The Kyoto Protocol, which will enter into force on February 16, 2005, will control industrialised countries' emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), plus three fluorinated industrial gases: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). The EU is responsible for around 24% of industrialised countries' man-made emissions of the six gases. Besides the EU emissions trading scheme, recent EU-wide measures that should also start to deliver emission reductions soon include legislation to improve the energy performance of buildings and to promote combined heat and power generation. Other existing EU policies and measures include: promotion of electricity from renewable energy; improvements in energy efficiency of large industrial installations; promotion of energy-efficient appliances; promotion of biofuels in transport; an auto industry agreement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions of new passenger cars; and recovery of methane from landfills. The report, prepared by the EEA and its Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change, is intended to support, complement and provide additional analysis for the European Commission's annual progress report under the EU greenhouse gas emissions monitoring mechanism (Council Decision 1999/296/EC).

This plan, which is due by mid-2005, will have a direct impact on people's lives. The Commission is therefore launching an internet consultation in order to reach the largest possible number of citizens. Starting today, the consultation will run until 31 January 2005 with results to be published by March 2005. \"The facts about the impact of air pollution on the human organism are disturbing, but in order to react properly, we need to understand more about causes and effects. There are things we can do to improve air quality and we have to start now,\" says Stavros Dimas, Commissioner for the Environment. Each European citizen is losing about 9 months of life expectancy due to poor air quality. Recent studies show that more than 22,000 premature deaths each year are due to high level of ozone, that there is a reduction in life expectancy of between 3 to 14 months due to particulate pollution, that 23 % of European forests are endangered by excess of acid rain and that 63% of the European ecosystems are endangered by excessive nitrogen deposition. Even if some impressive progress has been made in the past to reduce air pollutant emissions, there is still need and room for improvement. Future exhaust emission standards for cars, new ways of promoting clean transport, future air quality limit values, new reduction objectives per country or per sector, future targets for public health and environment - all these aspects and more will be included in the action plan. The consultation will ask questions like: In your opinion, what is the quality of the air in your neighbourhood? Is it important to further reduce air pollution? How much more should we do in the coming 15 years? What policies should we pursue to reduce air pollution? What are you as an individual prepared to do to improve air quality?

Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, was speaking at a dinner in Copenhagen to mark the Agency's 10th anniversary. She said the Agency's analyses showed that \"competing demands for space in a rapidly changing set of landscapes\" already posed a major challenge for Europe, and the EU's Lisbon goal was placing even harsher demands on its land resources. \"These demands on the natural capital have spilled out well beyond Europe's boundaries. So much so that we must now face up to the realisation that to move forward on a trajectory designed to meet the Lisbon agenda, Europe will have no option other than to exploit the rest of the planet or fundamentally alter the way in which it does business by becoming dramatically more efficient in its use of land and other natural resources.\" \"I can only hope it will choose the latter course of action,\" she added. Prof. McGlade said public trust was needed \"to ensure that Europe moves ahead on the basis of informed consent, where not only the information to be used but also the source of the information can be verified.\" But she noted that at the moment public trust in governmental decision-making was waning across much of Europe, whilst at the same there was \"a concerted effort by particular sectors to force the direction of Europe into even more intense use of the world's natural capital through loud and seemingly scientific-based campaigns.\" People's inability to check the veracity of these claims was causing unease and cynicism, she said. \"The fact that the debate (in Europe) will now need to centre not only on the economy but also on the resources required to support the economy -- people as well as natural resources such as clean air, water and soil and biological diversity - means that the (European Environment) Agency's role as an interlocutor and source of objective and reliable information and advice is even more critical,\" Prof. McGlade said. \"The challenge for the Agency is thus to ensure that the citizens of Europe can feel confident about what they read and hear, that they can communicate in a two-way process and that the debate about Europe's future is not a sterile debate but one that will truly reflect what is possible today without exhausting our resources for future generations.\" Looking back over the 10 years since the EEA started operating in 1994, Prof. McGlade said there had been \"tremendous changes\" in both society and nature over the period. \"We have seen the decline in many species across Europe, across all levels of the ecosystem. We have seen an exponential rise in the demand for cars. Waste is still increasing both in per capita terms as well as overall. And in many regions the first serious signs of climate change are beginning to emerge,\" she said. At the same time, there had been \"tremendous improvements in air and water quality, in access to nature and a general appreciation of the importance of landscape in both the rural and urban context,\" she added. The 10th anniversary dinner was held for 300 guests who have worked with the Agency or are prominent in tackling environmental issues elsewhere in the world. Other speakers at the dinner included: Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, until last week European Commissioner for Environment and now Commissioner for Institutional Affairs and Communication Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n, first Executive Director of the EEA and now special advisor to the Spanish Prime Minister on sustainable development. Prof. Jeffrey Sachs, Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, USA and Special Advisor to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The 10th anniversary celebration will continue on Thursday with a high-level conference on the theme of \"environmental awareness and public participation.\" Speakers include: Per Stig M\u00f8ller, Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs Mariann Fischer Boel, European Commissioner for Agriculture Svend Auken, former Danish Minister for Environment Corinne Lepage, former French Minister for Environment Dr Caroline Jackson, MEP, former chair of the European Parliament Committee on the environment, consumer protection and public health Sir Kenneth Collins, chair, Scottish Environmental Protection Agency Dr Vandana Shiva, Director, Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Natural Resource Policy, India Prof. Tim O'Riordan, Professor of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia, UK Note to Editors The Lisbon Strategy is a commitment to bring about economic, social and environmental renewal in the EU. In March 2000, EU leaders, meeting in Lisbon, set out a 10-year strategy to make the EU the world's most dynamic and competitive economy. Under the strategy, a stronger economy will drive job creation alongside social and environmental policies that ensure sustainable development and social inclusion.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) presented the results of its Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2000 project at a high-level event in Brussels for representatives from several European Commission departments - including regional policy, agriculture, research and environment - the European Space Agency and the EEA's current and prospective member countries. Using a common methodology, CLC2000 provides the first standardised survey of Europe's land cover for the year 2000 and of the changes that happened over the decade since the first CLC was undertaken in the late 1980s. Both products are publicly available at no cost through the EEA's web site. CLC2000's combination of geographical breadth and local detail is unmatched by any other land cover information programme in the world. The project already covers 30 countries and the number is expected to expand in 2005. \"Corine Land Cover 2000 will help policy-makers make better policies and plan a more viable future for Europe\", said Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director. \"It is a unique tool that makes it possible to measure the dynamic relationship between the many uses of our landscapes and the impacts - and unfortunately all too often the conflicts - that arise from different policies, such as agriculture, regional policy and transport.\" The EEA has produced CLC2000 from IMAGE2000, a satellite imaging programme undertaken together with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. Aerial photos and near-ground imaging were also used. From IMAGE2000, experts from across Europe have produced detailed maps showing 44 different land cover types, such as 'continuous urban fabric,' 'pasture' and 'non-irrigated arable land.' CLC2000 is expected to find a wide range of users. The 1990 CLC survey has been accessed by people working in, for example, research, agriculture, physical planning, forestry, education, transport, demography, tourism, energy and health, besides environment. It has also been employed in some commercial applications, for example atlases and in-vehicle navigation systems. In the policy domain, CLC2000's uses include providing support for protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the European Union's Water Framework Directive. It will thus aid implementation of key priority areas of the EU's 6th environmental action programme. CLC2000 can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field it can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land (or the contrary), expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. The EEA plans to undertake a thorough analysis of the changes revealed by CLC2000 over the next two years. Among initial findings is an expansion of urban sprawl during the 1990s in many areas, including Italy, the Netherlands, eastern Germany and Ireland. \"The huge growth in urban sprawl in eastern Germany is a warning of how neighbouring Poland could develop, now that it qualifies for EU regional development funding, unless action is taken to make such development more benign\", said Prof McGlade. \"Meanwhile we can see that in Ireland the urban sprawl is developing not around cities but mainly in remote countryside areas. This socio-economic development may be being encouraged by rural development funding provided under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy\", Prof. McGlade added. CLC2000 is available at http://dataservice.eea.europa.eu, where illustrative maps highlighting the changes between 1990 and 2000 in selected areas can also be found. IMAGE2000 data can be accessed from http://image2000.jrc.it/. Notes to Editors The development of CLC2000 involved some 300 experts from about 100 organisations across Europe and cost around 13 million euro. Creating the CLC2000 database took some 150 person-years of work. CLC2000 will serve as an input to the European Commission's 'Inspire' (Infrastructure for spatial information in Europe) initiative. This aims to set up a database of consistent geographical information to support environmental protection policies, infrastructure development, agriculture and maritime navigation. See http://www.ec-gis.org/inspire CLC2000 is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) initiative, run by the European Commission and European Space Agency, which from 2008 will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and field monitoring. Corine stands for 'Coordination of Information on the Environment.' The programme was set up in 1985, before the EEA was created.

At least half the summer sea ice in the Arctic is projected to melt by the end of this century, along with a significant portion of the Greenland ice sheet, as the region is projected to warm an additional 4-7 \u00b0C by 2100. These changes will have major global impacts, such as contributing to global sea-level rise and intensifying global warming. Sea ice retreat will decrease habitats for polar bears and ice-living seals to an extent likely to threaten the survival of these species in the European Arctic. Changes in climate are occurring in the context of many other stresses including chemical pollution, over-fishing, land-use changes, habitat fragmentation, human population increases and cultural and economic changes. These multiple pressures can combine to amplify impacts on human and ecosystem health and well-being, especially under the unique circumstances in the Arctic. Over inland areas in the Scandinavian Arctic, average wintertime temperatures have increased in the last 50 years by about 2 \u00b0C. By 2090, model simulations project additional annual average warming of around 3 \u00b0C for Scandinavia. These temperature changes affect forest, tundra and biodiversity. Observations over recent decades have shown a rate of advance of the treeline of half a metre per year. Climate change impacts on forestry are expected to become more severe, with forest pest outbreaks causing the most extensive damage. As species move northward, alpine species in northern Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia are most threatened because there is nowhere for them to go. The strip of tundra habitat between the forest and the ocean is particularly narrow and vulnerable to loss. Impacts of climate change and their implications for the availability of resources could lead to major changes in economic conditions and subsequent shifts in demographics, societal structure, and cultural traditions in the region. Jacqueline McGlade, the Executive Director of the European Environment Agency, said that it is not only the extent of change but also the speed of change that is a major issue of concern. This combined with the fact that many of the people living in the Arctic are not the cause of climate change but are on the receiving end of the impacts, makes this an urgent and pressing issue to address seriously. Europe has to act very responsibly to undertake economic analysis of the implications of climate change and adaptations for this area and most importantly has to consider the inter-related aspects of the policy aspirations for agriculture, transport and energy. The findings of the first Arctic Climate Impact Assessment provide a scientific basis upon which decision makers can consider, craft and implement appropriate actions to respond to this important and far reaching challenge. However, finding effective ways of bringing the information gathered in the ACIA process to the communities of the Arctic presents an additional challenge. Professor McGlade confirms that the EEA will continue to cooperate with the Arctic Council, indigenous peoples organisations and others to support the effort to make the results widely known and useful particularly to decision makers in Europe. The assessment was commissioned by the Arctic Council (a ministerial intergovernmental forum comprised of the eight Arctic countries and six indigenous peoples organisations) and the International Arctic Science Committee (an international scientific organisation appointed by 18 national academies of science).

These factors may be among the reasons why air pollution in Europe's cities is not falling faster, the Agency says in a new report, Ten key transport and environment issues for policy-makers. In addition, because the test cycle for new vehicles does not cover air conditioning and some other types of energy-consuming equipment, Europe's progress towards cutting new cars' emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) appears greater than it really is. \"Ensuring that vehicles actually meet the emission standards in the real world should be a priority,\" Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said in a speech to a high-level Dutch government conference on sustainable mobility held in Amsterdam today. The two-day conference will make recommendations to the new European Commission taking office next month. The EEA report and an accompanying briefing paper, launched at the conference, show that transport volumes are growing at roughly the same rate as the economy -- despite the European Union's goal of weakening this link - and continuing to intensify pressures on the environment. These pressures include rising emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases as the market shares of road and air transport continue to grow at the expense of less energy-intensive modes, as well as threats to biological diversity from the fragmentation or disturbance of wildlife habitats by roads, railways and airports. Efforts to counter these trends are at best only slowing the rate of increase. Improvements in vehicle technology are succeeding in reducing air pollution from road transport despite the growth in traffic volumes. Emissions of regulated pollutants (excluding those from aviation and marine shipping) fell by 24-35% between 1990 and 2001 in the 31 EEA member countries. But transport-related air pollution in urban areas still contributes to tens of thousands of premature deaths each year across Europe. Current test cycles for new vehicles do not reflect how cars are used under real driving conditions and so underestimate their actual emissions. This may help to explain why urban air quality is not improving as fast as vehicle data suggest it should, the report says. The shortcomings of the test standards also mean that, while Europe's motor industry is on track to meet a commitment to reduce CO2 emissions from new cars by one quarter between 1995 and 2008, greenhouse gas emissions from air conditioning and other in-car equipment not covered could in reality cancel out around half of the improvement. Even with the car industry's commitment, overall CO2 emissions from transport are projected to increase by 25% between 1990 and 2010, but without it the rise would be 35%. Some 15% of the CO2 improvement achieved so far has been due to the increasing market share of diesel cars, which are more fuel-efficient than petrol vehicles. But the practice of 'chip-tuning' diesel engines for greater power is a cause for concern because it increases fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. A recent report estimates that as many as half of new diesel cars may have been modified and that such changes can multiply their emissions, especially those of harmful particles, by up to three times. On a brighter note, strong growth under way in the use of biofuels -- transport fuels made from crops and other organic material -- should help the transport sector to limit increases in its CO2 emissions. However, it is important that the biofuels are produced in ways that minimise other potentially negative impacts on the environment. Further key messages from the report include the following: Aviation is the fastest-growing transport mode and its impacts on the climate, from emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, will soon exceed those of passenger vehicles. Rail and bus fares are rising faster than the cost of private car use, giving cars an advantage over public transport. Progress is slow in restructuring transport charges to reflect different modes' costs in terms of damage to infrastructure and the environment. Transport infrastructure, especially road and high-speed rail networks, is continuing to expand and thus further fragmenting the landscape. Optimising the use of existing infrastructure through road pricing or congestion charging would allow this growth to be limited.

There were representatives from agencies from 28 countries, as well as from the European Commission and the European Environment Agencies. The meeting was hosted jointly by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Environment Agency for England and Wales, who both provided an overview of the UK environment at the start of the meeting. In the first session, the network continued discussions on agriculture and the environment, performance evaluation and organisational efficiency, and the sustainable use of natural resources on the basis of presentations and papers from the interest groups set up at the last meeting (in Rome) to address these topics. The Environment Agency for England and Wales led the discussion on agriculture and the environment. It was agreed that the interest group would continue under the leadership of the England and Wales Agency and hopefully involve more participants. A workshop would be held on cost-benefit analyses looking at methodologies and definitions etc. with support from the Netherlands and the Czech Republic; the possibility of defining a piece of work in this field which could be carried out by the European Environment Agency would be explored. A seminar on rural development regulation, with Commission officials, would be aimed for (European Environment Agency, DG Environment, England and Wales Agency). It was agreed to gather evidence on the relationship between agriculture and natural resource protection (England and Wales Agency, the Netherlands, European Environment Agency). There was also interest in looking at the impacts of GMOs (Germany, Italy, Poland, Ireland, Hungary, Finland). Finally, the European Environment Agency would lead work on scenarios with support from Germany, England and Wales, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Norway and Italy. The work on performance evaluation, good practices and organisational efficiency was presented by the Italian EPA, on behalf also of the Swedish EPA. The overview of EPAs' priority issues was illustrated. It was agreed that the IG would continue its work with specific actions on: a) defining a minimum set of general criteria for identifying good practices among EPAs, building on the work carried out by the Swedish EPA and the Dutch Ministry of the Environment for selecting best results from the EU LIFE Environment Programme, while leaving more specific examples/case studies to other topical IGs; b) contacting the OECD, through EEA, to explore links to their environmental performance reviews; c) continue sharing information on the organisational efficiency of EPAs as related to overall environmental governance, taking into account the experience of regional and local EPAs and keeping in mind that EMS applied to EPAs is important but a small part of the overall issue; d) continue sharing information regarding performance evaluations; e) organise a face-to-face meeting, in conjunction with other ones to save time and resources. The Umweltbundesamt, Germany, presented the work of the interest group on sustainable use of natural resources. The network agreed to continue the interest group led by Germany and the European Environment Agency and to produce a paper defining the issue and developing common views on targets, measures etc. to feed into the development of the thematic strategy by the Commission. The work will distinguish between materials and resources and cover both. The second session looked at climate change and scenarios. Presentations were made by the England and Wales Agency, the Agency for Environment Protection and Technical Services, Italy, the Environmental Agency for the Republic of Slovenia, and the European Environment Agency. EPAs exchanged information on work both on mitigation of and adaptation to climate change and underlined the importance of tackling the second issue while continuing to address the first. It was agreed to establish an interest group on climate change and adaptation (led by Germany) to look at adaptation issues in general and specifically the provision of public information on flood risk based on flood risk mapping (Slovenia, England and Wales, the Netherlands, Finland). The group will also exchange information on methodologies for vulnerability mapping (Germany, Slovenia, Italy). All EPAs were encouraged to follow the GMES/Inspire process closely. The topic of the third session was 'improving environmental regulation' (in the widest sense) at both national and European levels. The England and Wales Agency, the Agency for Environment Protection and Technical Services, Italy, the European Environment Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency gave presentations highlighting experiences, initiatives and issues. Examples of modern, risk-based approaches were examined, but some of the institutional and political barriers to better governance were also highlighted. It was agreed to establish an interest group on 'better regulation' (led by England and Wales) with Sweden, Italy, Scotland and Ireland to continue the exchange of information on this question and to identify possible input into the ongoing Commission work in this field. The fourth session addressed environment and human health. Presentations were made by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the European Environment Agency. It was agreed to establish an interest group on environment and health led by the European Environment Agency to develop this area of work. Finally, the EPAs agreed that the main item on the agenda of the next meeting will be to review progress in the various interest groups (one day). The meeting will also share experience on the implementation of the Aarhus Convention (on access to information etc.) and there will be an opportunity for members to discuss areas of interest in smaller groups. The meeting will be held in Slovenia on 10-11 March 2005. Before the meeting proper there will be a possibility for interest groups to meet. The organising committee for the next meeting is composed of Slovenia, the Czech Republic, the UK, Austria and the European Environment Agency.

Wetter conditions in northern Europe but drier weather in the south that could threaten agriculture in some areas. More frequent and more intense heatwaves, posing a lethal threat to the elderly and frail. Melting glaciers, with three-quarters of those in the Swiss Alps likely to disappear by 2050. Rising sea levels for centuries to come. \u00a0 These are among the impacts of global climate change that are already being seen in Europe or are projected to happen over the coming decades as global temperatures rise, according to a new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA). \u00a0 Strong evidence exists that most of the global warming over the past 50 years has been caused by human activities, in particular emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) from the burning of fossil fuels. \u00a0 The concentration of CO2, the main greenhouse gas, in the lower atmosphere is now at its highest for at least 420,000 years - possibly even 20 million years - and stands 34% above its level before the Industrial Revolution. The rise has been accelerating since 1950. \u00a0 The summer floods of 2002 and last year's summer heatwave are recent examples of how destructive extreme weather can be. \u00a0 The serious flooding in 11 countries in August 2002 killed about 80 people, affected more than 600,000 and caused economic losses of at least 15 billion US$. In the summer 2003 heatwave western and southern Europe recorded more than 20,000 excess deaths, particularly among elderly people. Crop harvests in many southern countries were down by as much as 30%. Melting reduced the mass of the Alpine glaciers by one-tenth in 2003 alone. \u00a0 \"This report pulls together a wealth of evidence that climate change is already happening and having widespread impacts, many of them with substantial economic costs, on people and ecosystems across Europe,\" said Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director. \u00a0 She added: \"Europe has to continue to lead worldwide efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but this report also underlines that strategies are needed, at European, regional, national and local level, to adapt to climate change. This is a phenomenon that will considerably affect our societies and environments for decades and centuries to come.\" \u00a0 The extent and rate of the climate changes under way most likely exceed all natural variation in climate over the last thousand years and possibly longer. The 1990s were the warmest decade on record and the three hottest years recorded - 1998, 2002 and 2003 - have occurred in the last six years. The global warming rate is now almost 0.2 \u00b0C per decade. \u00a0 Europe is warming faster than the global average. The temperature in Europe has risen by an average of 0.95 \u00b0C in the last hundred years and is projected to climb by a further 2.0-6.3 \u00b0C this century as emissions of greenhouse gases continue building up. \u00a0 As a first step towards reversing this trend, the world's governments in 1997 agreed the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty under which industrialised countries would reduce their emissions of six greenhouse gases by around 5% between 1990 and 2012. \u00a0 So far 123 countries, including all member states of the European Union, have ratified the treaty but the US, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, has decided against doing so. To enter into force the Protocol still needs ratification by Russia. \u00a0 In addition to those mentioned above, a broad range of current and future impacts of climate change in Europe are highlighted in the report, including the following: Almost two out of every three catastrophic events since 1980 have been directly attributable to floods, storms, droughts or heatwaves. The average number of such weather and climate-related disasters per year doubled over the 1990s compared with the previous decade. Economic losses from such events have more than doubled over the past 20 years to around 11 billion US$ annually. This is due to several reasons, including the greater frequency of such events but also socio-economic factors such as increased household wealth, more urbanisation and more costly infrastructure in vulnerable areas. The annual number of floods in Europe and the numbers of people affected by them are rising. Climate change is likely to increase the frequency of flooding, particularly of flash floods, which pose the greatest danger to people. Climate change over the past three decades has caused decreases in populations of plant species in various parts of Europe, including mountain regions. Some plants are likely to become extinct as other factors, such as fragmentation of habitats, limit the ability of plant species to adapt to climate change. Glaciers in eight of Europe's nine glacial regions are in retreat, and are at their lowest levels for 5,000 years. Sea levels in Europe rose by 0.8-3.0 mm per year in the last century. The rate of increase is projected to be 2-4 times higher during this century. Projections show that by 2080 cold winters could disappear almost entirely and hot summers, droughts and incidents of heavy rain or hail could become much more frequent. Climate change does appear to have some positive impacts too, however. Agriculture in most parts of Europe, particularly the mid latitudes and northern Europe, could potentially benefit from a limited temperature rise. But while Europe's cultivated area may expand northwards, in some parts of southern Europe agriculture could be threatened by water shortages. And more frequent extreme weather, especially heatwaves, could mean more bad harvests. Whether positive impacts occur will greatly depend on agriculture's capacity to adapt to climate change. The annual growing season for plants, including agricultural crops, lengthened by an average of 10 days between 1962 and 1995 and is projected to continue getting longer. The survival rate of bird species wintering in Europe has improved over the past few decades and is likely to increase further as winter temperatures continue rising. \u00a0 The report, Impacts of climate change in Europe: An indicator-based assessment, is available at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/climate_report_2_2004/en. \u00a0 Notes to editors \u00a0 The 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will control industrialised countries' emissions of CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), plus three fluorinated industrial gases: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). The Kyoto Protocol is a first step towards the UNFCCC's ultimate objective to \"achieve stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic [human] interference with the climate system.\" What this level should be is not stated, but the EU has defined an indicative target for long-term global temperature rise of not more than 2 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. On present trends this target is likely to be exceeded around 2050. Achieving both the EU temperature target and the UNFCCC objective would require a substantial reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels. The report examines the state of climate change and its impacts in Europe by using 22 indicators that fall into eight broad categories: atmosphere and climate; glaciers, snow and ice; marine systems; terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity; water; agriculture; economy; and human health. For almost all the indicators a clear trend exists and impacts are already being observed. The 22 indicators illustrate only a small range of the potential consequences of climate change, but in other areas insufficient data are available for Europe or uncertainty exists over whether climate change is the cause of changes in the indicators. The report was prepared for the EEA by its European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change, including the Umweltbundesamt (Federal Environmental Agency, Germany) and RIVM (National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, the Netherlands) who both also contributed through additional national funding. \u00a0 About the EEA \u00a0 The European Environment Agency is the leading public body in Europe dedicated to providing sound, independent information on the environment to policy-makers and the public.

Greenhouse gas emissions from the EU's 15 pre-2004 member states dropped by 0.5% between 2001 and 2002, latest estimates compiled by the European Environment Agency show. The reasons for the decrease include warmer weather in most EU countries which reduced the use of carbon dioxide-producing fossil fuels to heat homes and offices. Slower economic growth in manufacturing industries, which also lowered fossil fuel use, a continuing shift from coal to gas and specific measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions were the other main reasons. Emissions of the six greenhouse gases had risen by 0.2% and 1.3% a year in 2000 and 2001 respectively. The fall in 2002 took total EU15 emissions to 2.9% below their level in the base year used for calculations - 1990 in most cases. This represents an improvement on 2001, when emissions were only 2.1% lower than in the base year. But it still leaves the EU with a long way to go to meet its commitment, under the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, to bring emissions in the period 2008-2012 to 8% below their base year level. Assuming the 8% reduction between the base year and 2008-2012 were to follow a linear path, emissions should have fallen 4.8% by 2002. On this basis, only four countries are on track to comply with the national targets that all pre-2004 member states have accepted under an agreement to ensure that the EU as a whole fulfils its Kyoto commitment. The four are France, Germany, Sweden and the UK (see annex for details). On the same basis, the other 11 pre-2004 member states are heading towards overshooting their emission targets, some by a substantial margin. This is the case particularly for Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, Italy, Denmark and Greece. Spain faces a greater challenge to meet its target than any other member state. Its emissions in 2002 were 39.4% above their base year level -- well over double the 15% increase it is allowed between the base year and 2008-2012 under the EU agreement. Since 2002, however, several EU and national initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have been approved which could lead to an acceleration of progress towards the Kyoto target. Chief among these is the EU emissions trading scheme starting next January, which has the potential to bring substantial cuts in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the most important greenhouse gas. In addition, some member states are starting to take advantage of other options for reducing emissions that are available under the Kyoto Protocol. These allow countries to achieve part of their targets by investing in emissions-saving projects elsewhere in the industrialised or developing world, or by undertaking projects that sequester CO2 in forests or agricultural land. The Netherlands, for instance, considers it is on track to meet its target of cutting emissions by 6% by 2008-2012 if its planned investments in foreign emissions-saving projects are taken into account. In 2002 its actual emissions were 0.6% above their base year level. Austria and Denmark have also earmarked considerable budgets for such projects but have not yet provided information on the emissions savings they anticipate. Greenhouse gas emissions from the 10 countries which joined the EU on 1 May will not count towards the EU reduction target. Under the Kyoto Protocol most of these countries have their own reduction targets of 6% or 8%, to be met by 2008-2012. The overall 0.5% fall in EU emissions between 2001 and 2002 reflected lower emissions from households and the services sector, mainly due to warmer weather, and from manufacturing industry, particularly the steel industry in Italy and the UK, as the economy slowed. The reduction was also due to measures that cut nitrous oxide emissions from the chemical industry in France and the UK, as well as measures in most member states to reduce methane emissions from landfills for waste. However, emissions increased from electricity and heat production and, with the exception of Germany, from road transport. Over the year Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal saw substantial emission increases of 10.4%, 4.2% and 4.1% respectively. Luxembourg's emission rise was due to the introduction of a new electricity and heat generation plant. Higher fossil fuel-based power generation to compensate for reduced hydro-electric power production due to low river levels was the main reason for the emission increases in Spain and Portugal. On the positive side, 2002 saw emission reductions of more than 1% in Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK. Germany and the UK dominate the EU-15 emissions picture, accounting for around 40% of total emissions. EU15 emissions of CO2, which makes up just over four-fifths of all EU greenhouse gas emissions, dropped by 0.3% between 2001 and 2002. CO2 emissions nevertheless stood 1.4% higher than in 1990, largely because of growing emissions from road transport since the early 1990s. A report detailing the latest emission figures is available at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/technical_report_2004_2/en Notes to editors The 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will control industrialised countries' emissions of CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), plus three fluorinated industrial gases: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). The EU is responsible for around 24% of industrialised countries' man-made emissions of the six gases. The Protocol has yet to achieve the required number of ratifications to enter into force. Under the Protocol, the mechanism by which industrialised countries can invest in emission-saving projects in other industrialised countries is known as Joint Implementation (JI). The mechanism for undertaking such projects in developing countries is known as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). JI, CDM and international emissions trading, which has yet to start, are collectively known as the Kyoto mechanisms. A \"burden-sharing\" agreement lays down differentiated emission limits for each of the pre-2004 member states with the aim of ensuring that the EU15 meets its overall 8% reduction commitment under the Protocol. The limits are expressed in terms of percentages by which Member States must reduce, or in some cases may maintain or increase, their emissions compared with the base year level. The national commitments are shown in Table 1 in the Annex. The EEA and its Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change compiles and quality-checks the annual emissions inventory for the European Commission from data provided by member states. The Commission has submitted it to the Secretariat of the UNFCCC. The inventory is published as EEA Technical Report No 2/2004 and titled Annual European Community Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2002 and Inventory Report 2004. Submission to the Secretariat of the UNFCCC. Figures for 2001 and previous years have been revised because of recalculations by member states using improved methodologies for estimating emissions and/or improved data on economic activity. The fall in total EU emissions between 1990 and 2001 has been revised slightly to 2.1% from 2.3% in last year's inventory. About the EEA The European Environment Agency is the leading public body in Europe dedicated to providing sound, independent information on the environment to policy-makers and the public. Operational in Copenhagen since 1994, the EEA is the hub of the European environment information and observation network (Eionet), a network of around 300 bodies across Europe through which it collects and disseminates environment-related data and information. An EU body, the Agency is open to all nations that share its objectives. It currently has 31 member countries: the 25 EU Member States, three EU candidate countries -- Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey - and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. A membership agreement has been initialled with Switzerland. Annex The following figures and tables give details, for the EU15, of trends in emissions of the six greenhouse gases up to 2002. Emissions from international aviation and shipping, and emissions from/removals by land use change and forestry, are not covered. Figure 1: Total EU15 greenhouse gas emissions in relation to the Kyoto target (source: European Environment Agency, 2004) Note: The linear Kyoto target path is used to evaluate actual progress towards the Kyoto target, not to estimate future emission trends. Table 1: Greenhouse gas emissions trends and Kyoto Protocol targets for 2008-2012 (source: European Environment Agency, 2004) 1) Base year for CO2, CH4 and N2O is 1990; for the fluorinated gases 13 member states have indicated they will select 1995 as the base year, while Finland and France will use 1990. The EU base year estimates for fluorinated gas emissions are therefore the sum of emissions in 1995 for 13 member states plus emissions in 1990 for Finland and France. 2) For Denmark, the figure in brackets represents the change in emissions since the base year (1990) after adjustment for 1990 electricity trade (import and export). This methodology is used by Denmark to monitor progress towards its national target under the EU \"burden sharing\" agreement. For the EU emission total, non-adjusted Danish data have been used. Figure 2: \"Distance to target\" indicator (source: European Environment Agency, 2004) Notes: The \"distance to target\" shown by the bars represents the deviation between a hypothetical target for 2002 and the change in emissions actually achieved by 2002. The hypothetical target for 2002 assumes that the allowed change in a member state's emissions between the base year and 2008-2012 will be achieved in a linear way. Distance to target is expressed in percentage points. The EEA's evaluation of progress is reflected in \"smileys\" according to the following rating system: Positive contribution to EU trend: a negative distance-to-target indicator means the member state is below its linear target path Negative contribution to EU trend: a positive distance-to-target indicator means the member state is above its linear target path 1) Denmark's distance-to-target indicator is +3.5 percentage points if its emissions are adjusted for electricity trade in 1990. 2) The Dutch distance-to-target indicator is --1.4 percentage points, putting it on track to meet its Kyoto target, if anticipated emission savings from use of the Kyoto mechanisms are taken into account. The Netherlands is the only country that has provided detailed information on financial resources earmarked for using the mechanisms, specific projects and quantified emission reductions.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/tec2-2004-en"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0833", "date": "2004-06-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Budapest workshop on 'Children in their environments'", "text": "Around 120 participants attended the EEA/WHO/Collegium Ramazzini science/policy workshop 'Children in their environments' on 22 June in Budapest.

Prof McGlade added: \"If our children knew how much we do not know about this large-scale experiment, they would be shocked - and if we told them what we do know, they would perhaps be even more shocked.\" Despite the lack of knowledge on many issues, it was clear there was a link between reducing environmental pollution and improving public health, she said. \"Overall, reducing environmental pollutants and stressors could lead to reductions in perhaps 5-20% of environmentally induced deaths, diseases and disabilities in Europe's children, with significant savings to future health and education budgets.\" The Budapest conference is focusing, among other things, on how best to create a shared \"environment and health information system\" that brings together the so far largely separate streams of data and information on the environment and on health. Prof. McGlade said much data and knowledge could be drawn from existing information - in many cases collected for other purposes - but new and coordinated information was also needed to fill the large knowledge gaps that remain. For example, she said, only for 14% of chemicals produced in large volumes are sufficient public data available to allow a minimal assessment of their risks - and then only for exposure to one substance at a time, not to the combinations of substances to which children are exposed in reality. \"Many elements of such an information service are already in place, mostly at country level, but more needs to be done if we want to look our children in the eye and say that our ongoing large-scale experiment is not damaging to their health,\" she said. In helping to build environment and health information services in partnership with the WHO, the European Commission, countries and other relevant actors, the EEA would focus on two main priorities over the next five years, Prof. McGlade said. The first would be to promote the collection of data on children's exposure to environmental contaminants in an \"integrated\" way - looking at pollutants in combination instead of individually - by further improving monitoring of the environment. The second priority was \"to turn scattered data into a reliable information service.\" This would be achieved by formulating relevant indicators and assessments of environment and health, and by presenting information on scales that were appropriate for different users. These scales ranged from the \"backyard\" of a national minister - in other words, the whole country - down to the local neighbourhood of citizens who want to know more about the environment in, literally, their backyard. Prof. McGlade said the circumstances surrounding a number of important health-related discoveries had shown that identifying and responding to early warnings of health hazards required many different players and multiple sources of information and knowledge. These sources needed to be integrated in ways that brought out the complex linkages between children-s environments and their health, she said. The full text of Prof. McGlade's speech is available at http://org.eea.europa.eu/documents/speeches/24-06-2004. In the sidelines of the conference Prof. McGlade and Marc Danzon, WHO's Regional Director for Europe, launched the first computer game specifically designed to raise children's awareness about health and environment issues. European Commissioner for Environment Margot Wallstr\u00f6m participated in the launch event. Titled Honoloko, the island of environment and health, the educational game for 10 to 14 year-olds was developed jointly by the EEA and WHO/Europe for the Budapest conference. It is available for free at http://www.honoloko.org or on CD-ROM and will be translated into the 25 languages of the EEA member countries as well as Russian. The game is also a key component of a new \"kids' zone\" that has been added to the EEA website at http://ecoagents.eea.europa.eu. Note to Editors WHO/Europe's Fourth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health is taking place in Budapest, Hungary from 23 to 25 June under the motto The future for our children.

Scientific methods now exist to investigate the future of such landscapes, based on different assumptions about future development of society, the economy and the climate. Hosted by the European Environment Agency, the meeting brought together scientists involved in the global Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), several European research projects, and policy advisors from the European Commission and from nine national governments. The MA is an international programme to provide scientific information on the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being and options for responding to those changes. In opening the conference, EEA Executive Director Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, emphasised that \"...managing European landscapes in the context of sustainable development requires sound up-to-date scientific information as well as a long-term vision for possible future development paths in all sectors involved in environmental decision making.\" Prof. McGlade said this new mode of integrated ecosystem assessment, in the form of scenarios and land-use accounting, is the focus of a new set of EEA activities. She welcomed the contributions made by European research projects and the international assessment community. The European Commission has supported research towards assessment of the various useful functions of agricultural and forested landscapes in Europe for people and societies over the centuries. Sustainable development goals are now also coming into focus. These goals urgently need to be achieved since the abandonment of agriculture in many areas, along with a warmer and often drier climate, changes life in rural communities dramatically. The MA is looking into the future of such communities by studying the impacts of different social and economic trends, such as a world with increased globalisation or one where more attention is paid to local communities and their needs. Conference participants agreed that scientists from various disciplines (social and natural), owners and users of the land and policy makers need to work together more closely to minimise the risk to biodiversity, agricultural and forest yield, water resources and other values. The conference also marked an important step in the EU-funded research network AVEC, whose main purpose is to develop common ground for discussions between scientists involved in the study of ecosystems. AVEC's chair, Prof. Wolfgang Cramer from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, welcomed the broad consensus that now exists about the significance of global change for ecosystems and the way they work. \"Until recently there was not very much acceptance of the need for ecologists, social scientists and stakeholders to work in close interaction, but now there are no longer are any borders between them\", he said. However, much remains to be done, even in the basic scientific understanding of plants and animals, he pointed out. Global change is creating unprecedented conditions at a rapid pace, and we must be prepared for the consequences, for example with respect to water resources, forest stability and the chances for endangered species to survive. Working with colleagues from around the world, such as Hal Mooney from Stanford University (USA), as well as with the EEA, will be necessary to provide the foundation for better environmental management in Europe. Some of the methods developed along the way will also be applicable to conditions in developing countries, where trends are often even faster and more directly detrimental than in Europe. A small but important European contribution to the assessment of such trends is the participation of young scientists from developing countries in the EU-sponsored AVEC summer schools, the next one of which is planned for 2005. The next generation of experts will be crucial to better understanding of ecosystems as well as to sustainable policy.

She continued: \"Renewable energy sources can play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and securing energy supply. These benefits are reflected in the indicative EU renewable energy targets for 2010.\" Prof. McGlade said, however, that the 2010 targets \"will not be met at current levels of political and financial support.\" But, she added, \"the sheer fact of having targets has brought us to higher levels of renewables than otherwise would have been the case. I do believe this is an important positive message for us to take away.\" The European Environment Agency would be examining a set of renewable energy targets for 2020 from an environmental perspective to support Europe's policy makers, she said. At the conference Prof. McGlade presented a new study on energy subsidies commissioned by the EEA. The study estimates that the EU and the governments of its 15 older Member States together provide 5.3 billion Euros a year in subsidies to renewables. This amounts to just over one-sixth of the total volume of subsidies given annually to the energy sector, which is estimated at 29.2 billion Euros, equivalent to 0.4% of gross domestic product. Fossil fuel production and consumption receive much greater subsidies than renewables -- an estimated 21.7 billion Euros, or over two-thirds of the total. \"From an environmental perspective, the level of support to fossil fuels remains high,\" Prof. McGlade commented. \"Support for renewable energy is, however, increasing steadily and is now significantly higher on a per unit of energy basis than for other fuels.\" \"In this regard the EU-15 states seem to have recognised that renewable energy is a much less mature industry with a greater need for technological and market support.\" Prof. McGlade pointed out that the EU was committed to moving away from environmentally harmful subsidies. For this to happen, however, agreement was needed on what constitutes an energy subsidy. A harmonised framework for reporting on such subsidies was also required since consistent subsidy data are not available, she said. The full text of Prof. McGlade's speech is available at http://org.eea.europa.eu/documents/speeches/03-06-2004 The report on energy subsidies is available at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/technical_report_2004_1/en Briefing on energy subsidies and renewables is available at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/briefing_2004_2/en Notes to Editors The 15 older EU Member States have agreed on indicative national renewables targets aimed at giving renewables a 22% share of EU electricity production and a 12% share of overall energy consumption by 2010. A Communication issued by the European Commission on 26 May concludes that renewables' share of electricity production will reach only 18-19% by 2010 on the basis of existing policies and measures carried out by the Member States, while renewables' share of overall energy consumption will reach at best 10% on the basis of legislation adopted so far. The Commission underlined the need for Member States to step up efforts to reach the targets and announced its intention to bring forward additional EU measures to ensure the targets are met. The European Parliament and various stakeholders have proposed the enlarged EU of 25 Member States should set a 20% target for renewables' share of overall energy consumption for 2020. The European Commission says it will review this at the latest by 2005 and start a process for setting a target for the post-2010 period in 2007. The International Conference for Renewable Energies Bonn 2004 is the first major follow-up conference on renewables since the World Summit on Sustainable Development in August-September 2002.

Nitrate pollution from farming continues: evidence suggests consumers are paying most of the clean-up costs for drinking water. Much of Europe's urban population is still exposed to air pollution above health protection levels: particulates and ozone are the main concerns. Packaging waste is increasing and is projected to continue doing so; overall trends in waste generation are unsustainable and current policy tools inadequate. These are among the main findings of the European Environment Agency's latest annual survey of environmental trends in its 31 member countries, EEA Signals 2004, published today. \"As we look ahead to World Environment Day on 5 June, the key messages in this year's report highlight the need to make further progress in managing the environmental impacts of agriculture, transport and energy in particular, as well as influencing changes in consumer behaviour,\" said Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director. \"This can be achieved by further increasing the use of market-based instruments to manage demand and fully incorporate environmental and other 'external' costs into prices, for example for transport; by switching more extensively to environmentally targeted subsidies, for example for agriculture; and by promoting innovation, for example for renewable energies.\" \"Similar instruments could also help address resource use and waste.\" \"The benefits for the environment and human health of taking such action will be multi-dimensional, affecting issues such as climate change, air pollution, biodiversity and water quality,\" Prof. McGlade added. Providing an update on selected environmental issues, the latest edition of EEA Signals covers aspects of agriculture, water pollution, nature protection, packaging waste, energy, transport, air pollution and climate change. The report also gives an environmental perspective on the economic and social situation in Europe, including trends in demography and resource use. It highlights, for example, that the area of built-up land is growing much faster than the population and that social pressures are driving a trend towards more and smaller households, which use resources less efficiently than large ones. It also underlines that energy consumption is still rising, giving major cause for concern over resulting impacts on the climate. Measures available to reduce demand include increasing energy efficiency, improving the uptake of renewable energies and rethinking options for transport. The number of weather- and climate related disasters in Europe doubled during the 1990s compared with a decade earlier. The average cost is conservatively estimated at around 10 billion euros per year and rising. \"Such figures suggest that managing Europe's natural resources is increasingly important for ensuring the viability of Europe's economic and social capital,\" Prof. McGlade said. \"This is money that could otherwise be spent in productive ways, for example to promote competitiveness and innovation, which are defining conditions for delivering sustainable economic growth.\" EEA Signals 2004 was presented on the opening day of this year's Brussels Green Week, the largest annual international forum for discussion of the European Union environmental policy, organised by the European Commission's directorate-general for environment.

It shows what type of very extreme weather events could happen if the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic Ocean suddenly 'switched off' within a few days as the result of global climate change. The Gulf Stream currently creates a warm climate in north western Europe (warmer than at equivalent latitudes). The film shows the effects of, for example, huge tidal waves, hail storms, and an abrupt and dramatic cooling (\"new Ice Age\") in the northern hemisphere. The general scientific view is that the timescales shown in the movie and some of the extreme climatic events are very unrealistic and much of the science behind the film cannot be supported. However some of the science is real. There is scientific agreement that the probability of a Gulf Stream switch-off and a substantial cooling in the Northern Hemisphere in the next hundred years and beyond are extremely low, since the ongoing global warming would offset any regional cooling. In the very unlikely scenario that the Gulf Stream would switch off, there would be cooling in North West Europe with associated impacts on agriculture and water resources, but this would not be a global phenomenon. However, ongoing and projected gradual global climate change does pose a large threat to human society and the environment, and the film helps to increase awareness of this problem. Source: Twentieth Century Fox, 2004 Of the following information, presented here, the UK Met Office Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research has provided the sections on \"How the Gulf Stream works\" and \"What might happen in future\". See: http://www.met-office.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/2004/pr20040430a.html How the Gulf Stream works Figure 1 - Global ocean circulation Source: Hadley Centre North western European countries are much warmer than other countries on the same latitude, and this is partly due to the Gulf Stream - a current of warm water that flows from the Gulf of Mexico past the shores of western north western Europe. It is part of a larger system of ocean currents (with a hundred times the flow of the Amazon) often called the 'conveyor belt' (or officially \"Thermo-haline circulation\"). The engine that drives this conveyor is in the northern Atlantic and the Arctic; the relatively warm, salty, northward flowing surface sea water there is cooled by bitter winds, becomes denser, sinks to the bottom of the ocean and flows south. If it did, a 'what-if' experiment with the Hadley Centre climate model shows that the UK (and similarly other NW European countries) would cool by up to 5 \u00b0C, and it could happen in a matter of a decade or two. If it did happen, the disruption to society would be enormous. What might happen in future? The Gulf Stream has switched off before, at the end of the last ice age about 13,000 years ago, when meltwater from a huge glacier in Canada flowed into the North Atlantic and stopped the sinking mechanism. Europe cooled by several degrees in only one or two decades. It has however been relatively stable for about the past 8000 years. The Hadley Centre using their climate model analysed the effect on the Gulf Stream of future climate change, caused by the greenhouse effect as carbon dioxide is emitted in ever-increasing quantities. Additional heat and freshwater in the North Atlantic and Arctic, due to global warming and coming from increased rainfall, melting of Greenland ice and increased river discharge in the Arctic basin, could disrupt the sinking of the warm salty water and thereby halt the thermo-haline circulation. The current scientific consensus (as expressed by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change, IPCC, see: http://www.ipcc.ch/) is that global warming, on the timescale of the next 50-100 years, may result in a weakening of the Gulf Stream, by about 20% by the middle of the century, but is unlikely to shut it down completely. The predictions of the best models (including that of the UK's Hadley Centre) are that north-west Europe will still warm but perhaps less so than if the Gulf Stream had not slowed. However, although the probability that global warming could lead to complete halt of the Gulf Stream appears to be very small, it cannot be completely ruled out. This is therefore an area of active research. The Hadley Centre and the Natural Environment Research Council, with researchers from Norway and the Netherlands, are addressing the issues in a major research programme. This aims to improve our understanding and reduce the remaining substantial uncertainties on processes in the earth's complex climate system and the oceans that could affect the Gulf Stream. Need for adaptation and mitigation of climate change Global and European climate has changed in the recent past. Temperatures are rising, frequencies of extreme weather events are increasing and precipitation in many parts of Europe is changing. Over the past 100 years global mean temperature has increased by 0.6 \u00b0C and in Europe by about 1.0 \u00b0C and the 1990s was the warmest decade over the past 150 years. Temperatures are projected to increase further by 1.4 to 5.8\u00b0C by 2100, with larger increases in Eastern and Southern Europe. According to the IPCC \"there is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities\", in particular to the emissions of greenhouse gases, see the IPCC Third Assessment Report - Climate Change 2001 (IPCC, 2001), see http://www.ipcc.ch/. The magnitude of the impacts in future strongly depends on the nature and rate of future temperature increase. Consequences of climate change include an increased risk of floods and droughts, losses of biodiversity, threats to human health, and damage to, but in some cases also new possibilities for, economic sectors such as forestry, agriculture, tourism and the insurance industry (IPCC, 2001). Some of these impacts are already beginning to appear. Within Europe, as well as within many other countries that have ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), there is a growing recognition that increased efforts on adaptation measures are required, while at the same time continuing to develop and implement policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The EEA is preparing an indicator-based assessment of recent and projected climate changes and their impacts in Europe for publication in the coming months. The report aims to assess the vulnerability of ecosystems, human health and socio-economic sectors, to climate change and enable the development of adaptation strategies, but also to enhance the sense of urgency to implement mitigation measures. The North Atlantic and Arctic oscillations Climate variation is often associated with oscillations, cyclical shifts in the weather and ocean currents. For Europe the most important are the North Atlantic oscillation, which primarily affects weather patterns in Europe and the Arctic oscillation, which has its main impact in the Arctic. These oscillations are strongly interlinked. During the 1990s, the Arctic oscillation was extremely high, and the weather associated with low-pressure systems penetrated further north, resulting in higher than normal rainfall and temperatures across western Europe and Scandinavia. The reason for the extreme high Arctic oscillation conditions in the 1990s is unclear. It could have been a response to global climate change, or a result of natural variability, or a combination of both. Whatever the reason, the 1990s might be an example of what can be expected as the more normal situation in the future (EEA report \"Arctic Environment: European perspectives\", forthcoming).

Session A. Framing and Identification of Some Hazards to Children In 1993 the National Academy of Sciences in the US published a report on Children and Pesticides which initiated the current focus on the links between children\u0092s health and their environments. The Chair of the Committee which produced the report was Prof Philip Landrigan. He will open the first session of the day with a scientific review of the science and policy actions since 1993.During this session speakers will address such questions as: \u0095 What are the implications for conventional risk assessments of mixtures; the timing of the dose; cumulative exposures; and the particular vulnerability of children (defined as foetus to 18)? \u0095 In a multi causal world where children\u0092s ill health often results from combinations of genetics, host conditions and environmental stressors, what proportion of morbidity and mortality can be attributed to the environment? \u0095 What do we know, or suspect, about the foetal origins of the childhood and adult diseases that are linked to environmental stressors, and what could be the main mechanisms of action? \u0095 Given the long periods between first exposure to environmental stressors and many diseases, what can we learn from animal experiments that can help us to identify and control hazards without waiting for the current experiments with our children to produce evidence of harm? What other kinds of evidence, or improved experimental methods, could be used to minimise the use of experimental animals? \u0095 The mad-hatters tea party in \u0093Alice in Wonderland\u0094 is named after the \u0093mad\u0094 hat-makers of the 19th century who were poisoned by the mercury used in their jobs. What are the new and emerging threats to children\u0092s neurodevelopment and how successfully have we dealt with \u0093old\u0094 threats such as mercury and lead? Session B. Monitoring the Health of Children Data collection and indicator systems for public health and the environment have mainly lived in separate worlds but after several years of development the first stages of a common information and indicator system have been piloted in some European countries.Speakers will address such questions as: \u0095 What are the respective roles of indicators, monitoring and research in identifying and managing environmental impacts? \u0095 How can the embryonic Environment and Health Information Systems of WHO/EU member countries be improved and integrated into a European System? \u0095 How can patterns in the geographical distribution of environmental exposures and diseases be linked by improved spatial assessments? \u0095 What has been the experience of one new EU member country (Poland) in implementing the monitoring and information sections of the NEHAP and what are the lessons that can be applied to the implementation of the CEHAPE? \u0095 How can integrated monitoring of exposures and assessments be achieved in a compartmentalised world? Session C. Actions to Protect Children The focus of the fourth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health \u0093The Future for our Children \u0094, 23-25 June, Budapest will be on action, following the identification of the issue at the 1999 Conference. Much of the Ministerial Agenda will be about the Children\u0092s Environment and Health Action Plan for Europe (CEHAPE). Session C will look briefly at some elements involved in implementing policies to protect children\u0092s health, including the precautionary principle; children as agents for change; and awareness raising within the paediatric profession.Speakers will address such questions as: \u0095 Why do children particularly need the precautionary principle? \u0095 How can risk, uncertainties and ignorance be better managed? \u0095 What role have children played as change agents in the development and implementation of occupational and public health policies over the last 200 years and what lessons from the past can be applied to the current and future actions to protect children\u0092s health? \u0095 How can the paediatricians and other child focused professions play a bigger role in protecting children from environmental hazards, especially in the new EU member countries? Conclusions The day will conclude with a panel discussion of stakeholders focussing on key issues arising from the presentations and discussions of the day.

High nature value farmland - usually characterised by low-intensity agriculture that allows wildlife to flourish - is recognised as having a crucial role to play if the 2010 goal of stopping the loss of biodiversity is to be met. Environment ministers from across Europe agreed last year to identify all high nature value farmland by 2006. They also committed themselves to support its economic and ecological viability by covering a substantial proportion with rural development measures by 2008. A joint EEA/UNEP report to support the process estimates that high nature value farmland covers 15-25 % of the EU countryside, with the largest areas being found in eastern and southern Europe and northern Britain. The situation outside the EU is not known as data are not easy to obtain. The report warns that high nature value farmland is under severe pressure from two contrasting trends: increasing intensity of agriculture in some areas and abandonment of farming in others. With nature protection sites accounting for less than one third of EU high nature value farmland, its conservation depends largely on the rural development measures that can be taken under the EU common agricultural policy. The most relevant of these are payments to support farmers in less favoured areas - such as hilly or mountainous terrain - and special environmental measures known as agri-environment schemes. However, although less favoured areas and high nature value farmland areas cover much of the same territory, actual spending on less favoured areas bears no relation to how much high nature value farmland a country has, the study finds. Nor do agri-environment schemes appear to be well targeted: agri-environment expenditure in countries with a high share of high nature value farmland, especially in southern Europe, is relatively low. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said: \"Current policy measures appear insufficient to prevent further decline in high nature value farmland areas and reach the 2010 biodiversity target. Consideration needs to be given to improving the geographical targeting of agricultural subsidies, especially of less favoured area support and agri-environment schemes.\" \"At the same time, a major effort is needed to fill gaps in data on the targeting and effectiveness of support measures as well as on the distribution of habitats and species.\" Frits Schlingemann, Director of UNEP's regional office for Europe, added: \"Over recent decades biodiversity on farmland across Europe has declined seriously. Large scale rationalisation and intensification of agricultural production has taken its toll.\" \"With the common agricultural policy increasingly focused on non-trade concerns, and sustainability now a guiding principle, we hope this report will spur the policy debate and encourage countries and institutions to refine the high nature value farmland concept and further focus their conservation efforts.\" High nature value farmland areas include habitats such as semi-natural grasslands, dehesas, montados, steppe areas, grazed uplands and alpine pastures and meadows. Little precise information exists on how well these areas are conserved, but overall the population of bird species found on them, such as the great bustard, black grouse and corncrake, is declining. Prof. McGlade and Mr Schlingemann launched the report, or \"joint message,\" at a Dublin conference on the role of environmental information co-organised by the Irish government and EEA. The report, High nature value farmland: Characteristics, trends and policy challenges, is available at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/report_2004_1 Notes to editors The EU has committed itself to halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010. The same target has been adopted under the 'Environment for Europe' process by environment ministers from across Europe, who met in May 2003 in Kiev, Ukraine. Agri-environment schemes reward farmers for environmental commitments that go beyond good agricultural practice.

Agriculture is an important factor in shaping the environment of the 10 acceding countries as well as the three candidate countries. Their farming systems currently have low inputs, low productivity and a rich variety of plant and animal species compared with the EU. Many have large farmland areas of high natural value. However, two environmentally damaging trends are expected to become more pronounced after they join the EU. One is a moderate intensification of agriculture in productive areas, involving greater use of fertilisers, pesticides and machinery to increase yields. The other trend is the abandonment of farming on marginal, less productive land that often hosts an abundance of wildlife. To minimise these pressures, the acceding countries need to use the right combination of environmental instruments available under the EU common agricultural policy (CAP), according to the EEA report Agriculture and the environment in the EU accession countries. Following reforms to the CAP, payments to farmers no longer encourage intensification of agriculture and some can be targeted to reducing land abandonment. Making use of the measures available under the rural development part of the CAP will be especially important, the report says. Such measures include so-called agri-environmental schemes, aid for less-favoured areas, farm advisory services and aid for small, semi-subsistence farms. However, substantial administrative resources are needed to implement these measures successfully. The main concern over land abandonment focuses on grasslands of high nature value that need limited grazing by sheep and cattle to maintain their richness. CAP payments can support farming income in such marginal areas to some extent, but in addition specific agri-environmental schemes to manage these species-rich grasslands will be needed. Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, said: \"A new strategic vision is required to deploy agri-environment measures as a central tool of environmental management and rural development in the 10 acceding countries.\" While farmers in the acceding countries will initially receive much lower direct income support than those in the current Member States, funding for rural development measures will be around the same levels as for existing members.

This is the key message of a new report, Arctic environment: European perspectives, published jointly by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the European Environment Agency (EEA). The report, compiled by experts at the UNEP GRID Arendal centre in Norway, warns that the northern polar region faces a diverse range of threats from unsustainable development, pollution and climate change. These threats include the fragmentation of wildlife habitats, over-harvesting of the region's once-abundant fish stocks and unsustainable use of other natural resources such as its vast forests. Unique plant and animal species are under threat or disappearing due to climate change. Pollutants, some known to be cancerous, are present in key Arctic species, causing great concern for human health. Piecemeal development is also beginning to have a major cumulative effect on the Arctic environment, with adverse economic and social consequences for its indigenous peoples. \"With the high levels of toxic chemicals in local Inuit peoples, the melting of permafrost and the retreat of glaciers across the region, the Arctic is like an environmental early warning system for the world,\" UNEP Executive Director Klaus Toepfer said. \"Luckily there are measures to address these problems. On 17 May this year, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants will become legally binding. This international legal agreement commits governments to stop the production and dispersion of the so-called 'dirty dozen' highly toxic chemicals. In addition, the Kyoto Protocol can enter into force and set the scene for further measures to address climate change if the Russian Federation accedes to it.\" \"Decision makers across Europe must clearly recognise that adopting such measures will bring not only environmental and social benefits but also clear economic advantages at home,\" Mr Toepfer continued. \"When it comes to climate change, implementing renewable energy policies and other actions that lessen the huge financial burden of floods and other weather-related disasters will result in stronger, healthier economies. Rather than having a negative economic impact, the Kyoto Protocol can help stimulate clean economies that will benefit both the Arctic and Europe alike.\" Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, EEA Executive Director, added: \"Governments, regulators, indigenous peoples and the private sector need to work together to manage the Arctic's natural resources and use them responsibly and equitably. These and other measures will not be accomplished without genuine commitment at all levels, but Europe's connection to the Arctic more than justifies this commitment.\" \"The European Union in particular has the potential to take a leading role in catalysing the response of the Arctic nations,\" she continued. \"Decision-makers need to take the current challenges seriously and find solutions to them through a structured process of consultation.\" Indigenous peoples have managed the Arctic's resources in a sustainable manner for thousands of years but today it is industrialised countries, including EU nations, that are both the main users and the main sources of pollution affecting the region. The indigenous peoples suffer most of the adverse effects of this exploitation while receiving a relatively small share of the benefits. By focusing attention on the Arctic, the report aims to contribute to the successful implementation of the EU's second Northern Dimension action plan, covering 2004-2006. Although the action plan's geographical priority is the Baltic area, it has the potential to address circumpolar and global issues affecting the resources and environment of the entire Arctic. The action plan, which includes a focus on sustainable development, is expected to play an important role in developing cooperation between the EU and regional bodies related to the Arctic, such as the Arctic Council. \"The contributions that the indigenous peoples living in the High North and the Arctic can make to this process, and the role they play in the stewardship of the region, are of key importance for the implementation of the new plan,\" Mr Toepfer and Prof. McGlade write in a joint foreword to the report.

For the first time, detailed information on pollution from around 10,000 large industrial facilities in the EU and Norway is publicly accessible on the internet (www.eper.cec.europa.eu). EPER enables European citizens to exercise their \u2018right to know', allowing them, for example, to see how much pollution large industries in their neighbourhoods generate and to compare this with the situation in other parts of Europe. Companies can measure themselves against their competitors, and for their part, scientists, insurance companies, local authorities and policy makers now have a solid database to help them choose the most effective solutions for reducing industrial pollution. Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstr\u00f6m said: \"People have the right to know how polluted their environment really is, because it directly affects their health and their quality of life. To require that they are informed is one of the Commission's most important duties. The new register provides people with such information, allowing them to compare the environmental footprints of different industries in different towns and regions. With this knowledge, they can put pressure on politicians and the industry - the information empowers them and is key to their involvement in environmental protection.\u201d Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, Executive Director of the EEA, added: \"EPER is a milestone in the provision of information to the European public about their immediate environment. The European Environment Agency plans to build on this by creating an extensive internet portal to regional and selected localised environmental information covering the complete area of the Agency's 31 member countries by 2008.\u201d What is EPER? EPER 2004, the European Pollutant Emission Register, is the first Europe-wide register of emissions into air and water from large and medium-sized industrial installations, including large pig and poultry farms. It covers 50 different pollutants and comprises data from all Member States as well as Norway, which has volunteered to participate. From March onward, data from Hungary, too, will be included on a voluntary basis. The EPER reporting website, which includes all reported data, is hosted by the EEA in Copenhagen. In close cooperation with the Commission, the EEA has managed the process of collecting the data for EPER from Member States, Norway and Hungary and has been heavily involved in the design and development of the website. EPER is accessible to everybody at www.eper.cec.europa.eu and makes it possible to search for the following data: Emissions from a specific industrial site by name, postal code, address or simply its location (map search) Industries in specific countries or by a specific activity Emissions by name of pollutants Combinations of all of these. Anyone can create their own overviews on pollution by activity, per country or in the EU as a whole! EPER also gives valuable information on every reported pollutant and its general impacts on human health and the environment. For example, EPER shows that 3,029 large pig and poultry farms are responsible for 78% of ammonia emissions into the air. Ammonia is a pungent-smelling gas that is noticeable in the air in quite low concentrations. High local concentrations of ammonia are toxic to health and may harm vegetation. Mercury, which is classified as a priority hazardous substance under the EU Water Framework Directive, is emitted to water by the chemicals industry (53%), the metal industry (17%) and the pulp and paper industry (7%). With regard to mercury emitted to air, energy-generating industries are the biggest polluters, followed by the metal industry and the chemical industry. Who will gain from EPER? Everybody will gain from EPER data. Citizens can see for themselves which emissions industries in their neighbourhoods produce and compare them with the emissions from other industries in other towns - even in other European countries. This enables them to ask questions about the amount of emissions, the risks they pose, potential reduction measures, etc. Companies can look at what their competitors across Europe are doing, increase their efforts to improve their environmental performance and show the public what is being done. Scientists, insurance companies, local authorities and policy makers have gained a good information base on emissions. For instance it is now possible to compare the emissions of an individual sector with the emissions of other industrial sectors. This will help everybody choose the most cost effective solutions for reducing pollution. Where does EPER come from? The Commission has promoted providing environmental information to citizens and involving them in environmental protection for a long time. In 1990, it granted the public access to data held by local authorities with the Directive on public access to environmental information. The idea of creating emission inventories came up at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and received the support of the OECD. In the EU, it became a requirement with the 1996 Directive concerning Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC Directive), which states: \"An inventory of the principal emissions and sources responsible shall be published every three years by the Commission on the basis of the data supplied by the Member States.\" By 2000 all the necessary details were worked out and outlined in the Commission Decision to establish EPER (2000/479/EC). Next steps This summer the Commission will publish a report reviewing and evaluating the timeliness and quality of the data reported by the Member States. It is already evident that the EPER data are not complete for some pollutants and countries, especially in sectors such as pig and poultry farms, landfills, metal surface treatment and industrial discharges into municipal sewer systems. The Commission will continue to improve, develop and upgrade EPER. The immediate next steps include the translation of the EPER website into every official language of the EU and, in co-operation with the Joint Research Centre, Ispra and the EEA, the inclusion of satellite images of the areas surrounding the industrial facilities in colour. At the moment, these pictures are still black and white for some countries. The EU also intends to ratify the UN-ECE Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs) under the Aarhus Convention. As a result, EPER will eventually be upgraded to a fully comprehensive European PRTR, which means that the public will get more information - for example on what industries do with waste. The Commission plans to put forward a proposal for a Regulation concerning the establishment of the European PRTR this summer. Under the Commission Decision on EPER, Member States have to update the data every three years, so the next reporting exercise will take place in 2006. Then, all the new Member States will be obliged to participate.

The main reason is a runaway increase in emissions from transport, especially road transport. However, the projections do not include any effects from several of the domestic policies and measures being developed under the European Commission-led European Climate Change Programme (ECCP). Among these is the EU emissions trading scheme due to start in 2005, a key initiative with the potential to deliver substantial additional emission cuts. Under the Kyoto Protocol, the 15-nation EU must cut its overall emissions of six greenhouse gases, widely considered to be contributing to global climate change, to 8 % below their 1990 levels by the period 2008-2012. An internal EU \u201cburden-sharing\u201d agreement also requires each Member State to meet a binding individual target for limiting or reducing its national emissions. As reported by the EEA in May 2003, the EU has so far cut its overall emissions to 2.3 % below 1990 levels (up to 2001, the most recent year for which complete data are available). But the latest projections show that existing domestic policies and measures \u2013 concrete initiatives already being implemented at EU or national level \u2013 will reduce the EU\u2019s total emissions in 2010 to only 0.5 % below 1990 levels, leaving it 7.5 % short of the Kyoto target. Even this result assumes that Sweden and the United Kingdom will do better than required, although the use of their \u2018surpluses\u2019 to assist Member States with \u2018deficits\u2019 cannot be taken for granted. If these two countries did no more than meet their agreed targets, the EU reduction would be just 0.2 %. On the basis of existing domestic policies and measures alone, all other Member States, including Germany, the EU\u2019s biggest emitter, would miss their Kyoto targets. Denmark, Spain, Ireland, Austria and Belgium would all exceed theirs by more than 20 % (see detailed figures in Annex). The latest projections are much more pessimistic than last year\u2019s because Germany \u2013 producing around a quarter of total EU greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 is now forecasting a substantially smaller emissions reduction than previously. The outlook is somewhat brighter when the additional domestic policies and measures being planned in 11 Member States, mainly in the energy sector, are brought into the picture. The additional initiatives \u2013 assuming they are implemented and have the effects anticipated - are projected to bring emission cuts of about 6.7 % on top of the 0.5 % reduction from existing policies and measures, giving an overall decrease of about 7.2 %. This is still nearly 1 % short of the EU target, however. Also, it assumes that Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Sweden and, in particular, the UK will limit or reduce their emissions by more than their targets require. If these six countries did not \u201cover-deliver,\u201d the total EU reduction would be only 5.1 %, leaving a gap of 2.9% to the target. Even with their additional domestic policies and measures, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain project that their emissions in 2010 will still be higher than allowed \u2013 by more than 10 % in the cases of Denmark, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands. Germany, Luxembourg, Portugal and Sweden have yet to provide information on any additional measures. The EU emissions trading scheme is considered one of the most important domestic policies and measures planned, but the projections do not assume any emissions cuts from it at this stage because Member States have not yet quantified these. The same goes for international emissions trading, one of the three so-called \u201cKyoto mechanisms\u201d that countries can use to reach their targets. The projections focus on domestic policies and measures because EU Member States are not yet legally required to report on their plans to use international trading or the other two Kyoto mechanisms, Joint Implementation (JI) and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), to meet their targets. There is currently also no legal requirement for Member States to report on plans to use the option of offsetting part of their emissions through sequestration of carbon in \u201csinks\u201d such as forests and agricultural land. Eight Member States have nevertheless provided information on their plans indicating that, overall, very limited use of these possibilities is foreseen at present. On the basis of this information, the total EU emissions reduction from JI and CDM is currently projected at 0.5 %. This is almost entirely due to projects involving the Netherlands. When these projects are taken into account, the Netherlands is projected approximately to meet its 6 % emission reduction target. Portugal projects a small emission saving from JI and CDM as well, while Austria, Finland and Sweden have also earmarked financial resources for using the mechanisms but have not yet identified specific projects or savings. The EU-wide emission cut from using carbon \u201csinks\u201d is preliminarily projected at around 0.3%. The transport sector, responsible for just over one-fifth of the EU\u2019s greenhouse gases, poses by far the biggest challenge to the Kyoto targets, largely because of fast-growing emissions from road transport. On the basis of existing domestic policies and measures, total greenhouse gas emissions from transport are projected to be 34 % above 1990 levels in 2010. This does not include rapidly increasing emissions from international air travel, which is not covered by Kyoto. All other sectors are projected to reduce their emissions except the energy supply and use sector, where a 2 % increase from 1990 levels in 2010 is projected on the basis of existing policies and measures. However, this rise becomes a 6 % fall when the additional policies and measures planned are taken into account. The EU\u2019s prospects for achieving its Kyoto target will not be affected by the arrival next May of 10 new Member States, several of which are projected to reduce emissions by much more than their own Kyoto targets require. The EU reduction commitment and the burden-sharing agreement cover only the 15 current members and the new countries\u2019 emissions will not be included in them. The latest projections are published in the EEA report Greenhouse gas emission trends and projections in Europe 2003. A summary of the report is published on the EEA website at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/environmental_issue_report_2003_36-sum. Notes for Editors The Kyoto Protocol, which has not yet entered force, will control industrialised countries\u2019 emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), plus three fluorinated industrial gases: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). The EU is responsible for around 24% of industrialised countries\u2019 man-made emissions of the six gases. Domestic policies and measures are regulatory, negotiated or economic instruments at EU or national level which have the effect of reducing emissions. Examples include energy-efficiency legislation, the voluntary agreement between the European Commission and the car industry on reducing CO2 emissions from new passenger cars, energy/carbon taxes and the internal EU emissions trading scheme. Under the Kyoto Protocol, Joint Implementation (JI) allows industrialised countries investing in emissions-saving projects in other industrialised countries to count those savings towards their own emissions targets. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) allows industrialised countries investing in developing countries to do the same. The report, prepared by the EEA and its Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change, is intended to support, complement and provide additional analysis for the European Commission\u2019s annual progress report under the EU greenhouse gas emissions monitoring mechanism (Council Decision 1999/296/EC).

Slovenia is the only one of the 10 acceding and candidate countries in cetral and eastern Europe that currently expects to miss its target, according to the projections compiled by the European Environment Agency. Overall emissions of the six greenhouse gases declined substantially in most countries in the region during the 1990s, mainly due to the introduction of market economies and the consequent restructuring or closure of heavily polluting and energy-intensive industries. However, greenhouse gas emissions from transport are a growing concern, as they are in the European Union. After dropping in the early 1990s, these emissions have been increasing strongly in central and eastern Europe since the middle of the last decade. In 2001 the 10 countries\u2019 combined emissions from transport of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, exceeded the 1990 level for the first time, by 4 %. Under the protocol, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia must cut their national greenhouse gas emissions to 8 % below the levels in a chosen base year (see Annex for details) by 2008-2012. Hungary and Poland have reduction targets of 6 % from their base years, to be met by the same dates. In the latest year for which complete data are available \u2013 in most cases 2001 - the 10 countries\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions, taken together, were an estimated 36% below base year levels. The reductions ranged from 60.8 % in Latvia to 17.8 % in Hungary. The only exception was Slovenia, whose greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have increased by 1.4 %. The latest national projections show that six of the countries \u2013 Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Poland and the Slovak Republic \u2013 expect to meet their Kyoto targets comfortably with the help of initiatives already being implemented at home, known as \u2018existing domestic policies and measures.\u2019 In 2010, Latvia and Estonia anticipate having the largest emissions reductions, of 58.2 % and 56.6 %, respectively, from their base year (1990) levels. The smallest cut, 6 %, would be in Hungary, enabling it exactly to meet its reduction target. Slovenia, however, expects its emissions in 2010 to be 9.6 % higher than in its base year (1986), thereby missing its 8 % reduction target by a substantial margin. Lithuania and Romania have not provided projections. Six countries also plan additional domestic policies and measures. In Slovenia\u2019s case these would still leave it 6.5 percentage points short of meeting its target. For the other five countries \u2013 Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland and the Slovak Republic - the additional domestic policies and measures further increase the margin by which they expect to reduce emissions beyond what their targets require.

Prof. Jacqueline McGlade, the Agency's Executive Director, said: \"Poul Harremo\u00ebs was a true friend and supporter of the EEA from its beginnings 10 years ago. He always offered great encouragement and, as one of the most active members of the Scientific Committee over a period of eight years, helped to ensure that the scientific quality and direction of the Agency's work approached his own very high standards.\" \"The EEA owes Poul an enormous debt of gratitude and he will be greatly missed among us. I know that all staff who knew him will join me in extending our deepest condolences to his widow, Hanne, and their family.\" Leo Larsen, Permanent Under-Secretary of State at the Danish Ministry of Environment and Denmark's member of the EEA Management Board, commented: \"For many years Poul Harremo\u00ebs represented the best in Danish science. I know that his expertise was a major support in the challenge of creating the European Environment Agency from scratch, and we are grateful for his substantive work in the EEA's Scientific Committee.\" Prof. Harremo\u00ebs was Professor of Environmental Science and Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark for over 30 years until his death last week at the age of 69. He played a leading role in the establishment of the Danish ministry of Environment, the first of its kind in the world. His awards include the Stockholm Water Prize (1992) and the Heineken Prize for environmental science (2000). In addition to his membership of the EEA's Scientific Committee, Prof. Harremo\u00ebs chaired the editorial team that produced one of the Agency's most successful reports, Late lessons from early warnings: the precautionary principle 1896-2000, published in 2001. Prof. Philippe Bourdeau, chair of the Scientific Committee from 1994 to 2002, added: \"Poul Harremo\u00ebs was a world-class expert in water engineering whose inquisitive mind led him to delve into new developments on the environmental scene, such as the application of the precautionary principle. The EEA project on this topic that he so enthusiastically implemented produced one of the Agency's best-known publications. He will be remembered and missed by all who met him and worked with him.\" At the time of his death Prof. Harremo\u00ebs was preparing an ambitious international conference on the precautionary principle to be held next year. David Gee, who led the EEA's work on the Late lessons report, said Prof. Harremo\u00ebs developed a \"passion\" for the subject as a result of working on the report and was rapidly becoming a globally recognised expert on the precautionary principle. \"Poul Harremo\u00ebs worked with a mischievous sense of humour, impatience with process and a passion for detail. He was a formidable sparring partner in the intellectual jousting he loved, yet always generous in his support for students, Agency staff and recent recruits to the fields he knew well. The Agency has lost a great friend and supporter,\" Mr Gee said.

This makes it important to monitor the effects of next year's enlargement of the European Union on agriculture and water resources in the new Member States. Economic restructuring in central and eastern Europe during the 1990s generally led to reduced pressures on the aquatic environment, but any widespread intensification of agriculture after EU enlargement is likely to reverse this trend. The European Environment Agency today publishes a short briefing paper, Status of Europe's water, summarising the overall picture and highlighting the issues on which progress is and is not being made. The briefing is based on the EEA report Europe's water: an indicator-based assessment, published last month. Nearly 30 years of European Union environmental legislation, together with national and international action, to protect and improve the aquatic environment are bearing fruit in many areas, although large gaps in data on some issues mean that related conclusions must be treated with caution. Where overall progress is being achieved on an issue there can still be specific problems and geographical 'hot spots,' however. The areas of progress include generally improving river quality in 14 countries for which information is available. Pollution of rivers and lakes by phosphorus and organic matter from industry and households has seen a notable reduction, and discharges of these substances into the seas have also fallen. River pollution by heavy metals and other hazardous substances is generally decreasing and there is evidence that this is also lowering concentrations in Europe's seas. The total amount of oil spilt from vessels dropped during the 1990s. There has also been progress in reducing overall water withdrawals ('abstraction') and use, except in the western part of southern Europe. Furthermore, significant improvements in information about Europe's water have been achieved through the implementation of Eurowaternet, a water data and information gathering network coordinated by the EEA. By contrast, no overall progress is being made on reducing nitrate and pesticide pollution or water withdrawals for irrigation, energy use and tourism. Nitrate pollution, particularly from fertilisers used in agriculture, has remained constant and high. Nitrate concentrations in rivers remain highest in those western European countries where agriculture is most intensive. There is no evidence of changes of nitrate concentrations in groundwater, and nitrate in drinking water remains a common problem across Europe. Pesticides from agriculture continue to be present at concentrations that are cause for concern in raw water used for drinking water production, but lack of data makes it impossible to establish trends. Regarding water withdrawals, there has been a slightly increasing trend in agricultural water use, such as for irrigation, in western southern Europe. The same trend can be seen in water for energy production in the countries of central and eastern Europe that will join the EU next May. Tourism is placing a significant and most probably growing burden on water resources in many parts of southern Europe. Excessive water withdrawal remains a major concern in areas such as the coast and islands of the Mediterranean where drinking water sources have consequently become contaminated with seawater. The briefing paper is the first in an occasional series. It is published on the EEA website. The full report is available at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/topic_report_2003_1 and the summary at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/report_2003_0617_150910/en/tab_abstract_RLR. Notes for Editors The countries that will join the EU next May, known as the acceding countries, are Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. Bulgaria and Romania are negotiating to join at a later date, while Turkey has applied for EU membership but has not yet started negotiations.

The board also elected Lars-Erik Liljelund, Director General of Sweden's Environmental Protection Agency, as its new chair. He takes over from Professor Kees Zoeteman of the Netherlands, who has led the board for almost four years. Preparing the new corporate strategy for 2004-2008 and next year's work programme has been a major focus of activity for EEA Executive Director Professor Jacqueline McGlade since she took up the post in June. In addition to the Agency's core task of reporting on the state of Europe's environment, the strategy sets out two major new priority areas of work. These are: Supporting the integration of the acceding and candidate countries into the European Union and assessing the impacts of EU enlargement on Europe's environment; and Analysing the effectiveness, impacts and benefits of EU environment policies, including sectoral policies in agriculture, energy and transport. The new strategy is aligned with the EU's 6th Environment Action Programme (6EAP). Many of the EEA's activities over the next five years will be geared towards providing the information and environmental assessments needed to implement the 6EAP as well as the EU Sustainable Development Strategy. The Agency will work across four major thematic areas: tackling climate change; tackling biodiversity loss and understanding spatial change; protecting human health and quality of life; and sustainable use and management of natural resources and waste. With streamlining of data reporting a key issue for member countries, the Agency will continue to work with major European and international partners to establish ways in which environmental data need be reported only once but can be used for multiple purposes. The EEA will also improve quality assurance of the information it produces. The Agency will use selected strategic indicators to measure its performance against its objectives. Prof. McGlade said: \"The context of the Agency is rapidly evolving. Today the Agency is being asked by the European Parliament, the European Commission and its member countries not only to report and advise on the state of the environment and technical issues concerning environmental protection and the sustainable use of natural resources, but also the effectiveness of key environmental and sectoral policies and their implementation.\" \"Over the next five years the Agency will expand its work to support a variety of policy processes by providing knowledge of Europe's environment as well as the actions being taken to protect it.\" A limited internal reorganisation will become effective on 1 January to align the EEA's structure with the goals of the new strategy. The biggest change will be the creation of a corporate affairs and communications programme (department). A major focus of work in 2004 will be preparation of the data, information, assessments and scenarios for the Agency's next five-yearly report on the state of, trends in and outlook for the EU's environment. This is scheduled for publication in 2005. Mr Liljelund commented: \"I am delighted to be taking over as chair of the board at this exciting time in the Agency's development. With almost a decade of successful work behind it, the EEA is going forward into the next five years with an ambitious strategy to expand and further improve the information and analysis it provides to support environmental protection and sustainable development across an enlarging Europe.\" The strategy for 2004-2008 and work programme for 2004 are available on the EEA web site at http://org.eea.europa.eu/documents/strategy.pdf and http://org.eea.europa.eu/documents/amp2004.pdf Note for Editors The Management Board comprises one representative of each of the EEA's 31 member countries plus two representatives of the European Commission and two nominated by the European Parliament.

The unusually hot and sunny weather, combined with air pollutants emitted mainly by traffic, industry and vegetation, caused very long lasting and geographically extensive \u2018episodes\u2019 with high concentrations of harmful ground-level ozone. And this situation is likely to repeat itself in any future summers with above-average temperatures until measures taken under current legislation result in a much larger cut in emissions of the \u2018precursor\u2019 pollutants that cause ground-level ozone towards the year 2010. Emissions of the main precursors \u2013 nitrogen oxides and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) \u2013 fell by around 30% between 1990 and 2000 in the 15 European Union Member States. EU legislation setting national ceilings, to be met by 2010, on emissions of these and certain other pollutants will bring a further 30% cut. A summary of the assessment has been sent to EU environment ministers who will discuss the summer ozone episodes at their meeting on Monday (27 October). In contrast to the stratospheric ozone layer that protects against harmful solar radiation, ground-level ozone can cause serious human health problems and damage to ecosystems, crops and materials. It forms when the precursor pollutants react with sunlight. High temperatures worsen the situation by increasing emissions of NMVOCs from vegetation and man-made sources such as solvents. Out of 31 European countries reporting monitoring results this year, 23 suffered ground-level ozone pollution at concentrations well above an important human health threshold on one or more days between April and August. Beyond this threshold, set at 180 micrograms of ozone per cubic metre of air (180 \u00b5g/m3) averaged over one hour, exposure for a short period can have limited, temporary effects on the health of children as well as of adults who are particularly sensitive to ozone. Governments are required by European Union law to inform the public whenever the 180 \u00b5g/m3 threshold is breached. The threshold was exceeded in at least one of the 23 countries on 137 of the 153 days monitored between April and August. Only the Nordic countries, the Baltic States and Ireland reported no exceedances (see Annex). Breaches of the threshold lasted an average of 3.5 hours, the longest average period since 1995, with a high of 4.2 hours on average recorded in the Slovak Republic. The ozone concentration during the episodes averaged 202 \u00b5g/m3 in the 23 countries affected and reached an average of 246 \u00b5g/m3 in Romania. The number of hours during spring and summer when ozone concentrations at each monitoring station were above the 180 \u00b5g/m3 threshold averaged 31 for the EU, its highest number ever. In France the number was one-third higher than the previous record set nine years ago. The areas with the most exceedances of the threshold were south-west Germany, Switzerland, northern and south-eastern France, Belgium, northern and central Italy and central Spain. These are also among the regions with the highest density of emissions from traffic and industry of the main pollutants contributing to ozone. Under revised EU ozone legislation that took effect in September, the ozone concentration above which brief exposure is considered to pose a health risk for the general population has been tightened from 360\u00b5g/m3, averaged over one hour, to 240\u00b5g/m3. Governments are required to warn the general public to take precautions whenever the threshold is exceeded. The 360 \u00b5g/m3 threshold, which still applied this spring and summer, was breached four times - twice in mid-June, at stations in northern Italy (Varenna) and Romania (Chiciu), and twice in early August at one monitoring station in south-east France (Sausset les Pins). This number of exceedances is in line with previous years, despite this year\u2019s hotter temperatures. The highest ozone concentration was 417 \u00b5g/m3, reached at Sausset les Pins during the heatwave that affected much of Europe in the first half of August. The new 240 \u00b5g/m3 threshold, which was not yet in force this summer, was exceeded in 15 countries and in around 6% of the episodes where the 180 \u00b5g/m3 information threshold was breached. Notes for Editors This summary of the ozone situation in 2003 is based on the forthcoming EEA report to the European Commission titled Air pollution by ozone in Europe in summer 2003: Overview of exceedances of EC ozone threshold values during the summer season April-August 2003 and comparisons with previous years. The report was prepared by the EEA\u2019s Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change. A day on which a threshold is exceeded for at least one hour is counted as one exceedance. Human exposure to elevated ozone concentrations can give rise to adverse effects on the breathing system and decreases in lung function. Symptoms observed during smog events are coughing, chest pain, difficulty in breathing, headache and eye irritation. Exposure of ecosystems and agricultural crops to ozone results in visible injury to foliage and reductions in crop yield and seed production. Adverse effects on vegetation can be noted at relatively low ozone concentrations which occur frequently in Europe. EU legislation on ozone pollution was established in 1992 by directive 92/72/EEC. This was replaced on 9 September 2003 by directive 2002/3/EC on ozone in ambient air. Besides the 15 EU Member States, the countries which reported on their ozone levels this year were Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, FYROM, Hungary, Iceland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Switzerland. A total of 1,805 monitoring stations across these 31 countries are assumed to have been operational during the spring and summer.

Although it is a minor constituent, it is key to important atmospheric processes. Most ozone is in the stratospheric ozone layer. This \"good ozone\", protects life from dangerous ultraviolet radiation from the sun. However, direct exposure to ozone is hazardous and the \"bad ozone\" in ambient air at ground level has harmful effects on human health, on plants and on materials. Ozone in ambient air is formed by chemical reactions between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) under influence of sunlight. Ozone concentrations can build up to high values during warm sunny days. Ozone concentrations today are much higher than a century ago due to emissions of NOx and VOC into the atmosphere from traffic, industry and other sources. Ozone is the main product of complex photochemical processes in the lower atmosphere involving oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds as precursors of ozone formation. Ozone is a strong photochemical oxidant. Its elevated concentrations cause serious health problems and damage to ecosystems, agricultural crops and materials. Map 1. Example of a smog episode: stations which reported an hourly ozone concentration in excess of 180 \u00b5g/m3, 17-19 and 22 June 2002 (all station types) Source: map produced by the European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change. Ozone episodes, periods with elevated concentrations, mainly occur during periods of warm sunny weather. In Mediterranean countries, with prolonged spells of hot and sunny weather during the summer, ozone can quickly be formed and high concentrations can occur in the vicinity of urban centres. In northern Europe, the build-up of ozone is slower due to the more moderate weather conditions. Here, the highest levels are usually found downwind of cities. The limit values set by the European Union to protect health are exceeded frequently for a large proportion of the EU\u0092s population. Estimates for 1999, for example, suggest that 42% of the population was overexposed on 1-25 days, with 12% overexposed for more than 50 days. Only the Northern European countries and Portugal had less than 10 \u0091exceedance days\u0092. Although emissions of the substances that lead to ground level ozone are dropping, the reductions are unlikely to help meet either today\u0092s or tomorrow\u0092s targets, with north-west Europe expected to experience around 25 exceedance days per year by 2010. This is partly due to emissions in the whole northern hemisphere. Scientific research has shown that ozone, NOx and VOC can be transported over distances of hundreds or even thousands kilometres. Under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution, countries in Europe and North America have agreed to reduce emissions according to the terms of a number of protocols. In order to protect human health and the environment, the European Union, in legislation, has set targets and long-term objectives for ozone concentrations and will limit the national emissions of NOx and VOC. The legislation requires that citizens be properly informed about concentrations of ozone and other air pollutants.

The map shows the increase in the number of summer days per year, in the last 25 years, and is expressed in number of days per decade. Clearly, large parts of Europe experienced an increase of more than 6 days in the number of summer days (hence, and increase of 15 or more days since 1976). Regions that have relatively many days per year near 25 \u00b0C maximum temperature have largest sensitivity for changes; other regions are less sensitive. This explains why e.g. northern Scandinavia show little increase in the number of summerdays (most often, maximum temperatures are well below 25 \u00b0C).

Europe includes Siberia. Over the past 100 years European (including Siberia) mean temperature has increased by about 1.2 \u00b0C and the 1990s was the warmest decade over the past 150 years. There is increased evidence that most of this warming can be attributed to the emission of greenhouse gases from human activities. The flooding in central Europe in 2002 can be considered an example of what may happen if climate change continues. Global precipitation increased by about 2 % during the last century, with northern Europe and the western part of the Russian Federation getting 10\u009640 % wetter with a further projected increase of 1\u00962 % per decade. In southern Europe and most of the countries of eastern Europe precipitation in summer is projected to decrease by up to 5 % per decade, while the winters may become wetter.

This is one of the key messages from the European Environment Agency's latest assessment of the environment in Europe, published today. Europe's Environment: the third assessment has been prepared for the 'Environment for Europe' ministerial conference taking place in Kiev, Ukraine, on 21-23 May under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). The two previous assessments were published by the Agency in 1995 and 1998 for the conferences held in Sofia, Bulgaria, and in Aarhus, Denmark. The new report covers a total of 52 countries, including for the first time the whole of the Russian Federation and the 11 other Eastern European, Caucasus and Central Asian (EECCA) states. It shows that most of the progress towards environmental improvement continues to come from 'end-of-pipe' measures to limit pollution or as a result of economic recession and restructuring in many parts of Europe. \"We know from the past that these gains will be lost again if economic growth continues to be based on traditional, environmentally damaging activities, still prevalent, rather than on more sustainable, eco-efficient options,\" said Gordon McInnes, EEA Interim Executive Director. \"This is a particular risk for the EU accession countries and the EECCA states, to which large amounts of manufacturing industry have been transferred from western Europe and elsewhere,\" Mr McInnes added. While highlighting wide differences in the environmental situation between and within the different regional groupings, the report confirms that environmental policies, when properly developed and implemented, have in several fields led to significant improvements in the environment and to lower pressures on it. For example, substantial reductions have been achieved in Europe's emissions of substances that damage the atmospheric ozone layer. Decreases in acidifying emissions to air and in emissions to water from point sources - such as factories - have generally improved the quality of both media. Protection of the habitats of biologically important plant and animal species has brought some improvement in their situation. In contrast, environmental policies to curb waste have made no significant headway, and pressures are still increasing on some natural resources, especially fish stocks, top soil and land. Emissions to water from diffuse sources such as agriculture remain a problem. Economic and social transition since the early 1990s - with western Europe developing into a more service-oriented society and the rest of the continent moving towards a market economy, albeit at different speeds - has resulted in environmental improvements in some fields but degradation in others. Europe, overall, has seen reductions in its emissions of greenhouse gases. In Central and Eastern Europe and EECCA there has been less pressure on water resources from agriculture and industry. In these countries economic restructuring has also been the major driving force behind reductions in emissions of air pollutants. On the negative side, land abandonment due to economic restructuring in Central and Eastern Europe and EECCA is threatening biodiversity. Economic growth is making it more difficult for many western European countries to meet their national targets for limiting greenhouse gas emissions. Urban development and transport infrastructure is covering over large areas of productive soil and fragmenting major animal and plant habitats in many places across the region. Overfishing is threatening marine natural resources. As environmental improvements in these areas are mainly determined by the general economic situation, much of the progress seen to date is unlikely to be sustained under conditions of continuing or renewed economic growth. At the same time, many of the negative impacts are likely to be exacerbated. This trend is already apparent in the field of transport, where a marked shift towards road and aviation in place of more environment-friendly modes is under way, increasing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Human health continues to face a range of environment-related threats. Generation of hazardous waste is increasing across Europe. The quality of drinking water remains a concern throughout the region, while exposure to particulate matter is now the biggest threat to human health from air pollution in western European cities. The report concludes that the formulation and implementation of policies which take full account of environmental concerns needs to be accelerated if Europe is to ensure proper protection of its environment and succeed in making the transition to more sustainable development. \"The EU Sustainable Development Strategy is a step in the right direction but needs more operational action by the relatively well-off EU Member States to remain environmentally credible,\" said Mr McInnes. He added: \"What is most lacking is a decision-making framework that takes proper account of the competing but often complementary economic, social and environmental considerations. The various initiatives on European regional energy cooperation are a good example of such a framework in action.\" An embargoed summary of the report is available now for download at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/environmental_assessment_report_2003_10-sum.

About the EEA The European Environment Agency is the main source of information used by the European Union and its Member States in developing environment policies. The Agency aims to support sustainable development and to help achieve significant and measurable improvement in Europe's environment through the provision of timely, targeted, relevant and reliable information to policy-making agents and the public. Established by the EU in 1990 and operational in Copenhagen since 1994, the EEA is the hub of the European environment information and observation network (Eionet), a network of around 300 bodies across Europe through which it both collects and disseminates environment-related data and information. The Agency, which is open to all nations that share its objectives, currently has 31 member countries. These are the 15 EU Member States; Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, which are members of the European Economic Area; and the 13 EU accession and candidate countries, namely Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, the Slovak Republic and Turkey (from this month). The EEA is the first EU body to take in the accession countries.

Total EU emissions of six gases widely considered to be contributing to global climate change are estimated to have stood 1.0% higher in 2001, the latest year for which data are available, than a year earlier, the annual emissions inventory compiled by the European Environment Agency shows. A preliminary assessment indicates that the main reasons for the rise were a colder winter in most EU countries that led households to burn more heating fuel, higher emissions from transport and greater use of fossil fuels in electricity and heat production. Despite the increase from 2000, EU GHG emissions in 2001 stood 2.3% below their level in 1990. However, this was less of a drop than in the two previous years. In 2000 emissions had stood 3.3% lower than in 1990 and in 1999, 3.6% lower. The EU must bring down its emissions of the six gases to 8% below their 1990 level by 2008-2012 if it is to comply with the Kyoto Protocol on combatting climate change. The inventory represents best estimates and is subject to annual revision. It does not take account of the impact of land use and forestry, which can either produce emissions or absorb them, because no internationally accepted methodologies exist yet. EU emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), by far the most important greenhouse gas, accounting for 82 % of total EU GHG emissions, increased by 1.6% between 2000 and 2001. They also stood 1.6% higher in 2001 than in 1990. Revised figures show that the EU held its CO2 emissions in 2000 at their 1990 level, as it had committed itself to do. Initial data had indicated that CO2 emissions in 2000 were 0.5% lower than in 1990. Increased heating needs meant that CO2 emissions from households and small businesses jumped 6.0% in 2001 from a year earlier, contributing substantially to the increase in overall GHG emissions. Germany, France and the United Kingdom saw the biggest rises in CO2 emissions from households and small businesses. CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production rose by 1.5% between 2000 and 2001, and those from transport by 1.3%. The main reasons for these increases are growing production of power and heat from fossil fuels, in particular coal, and a continuing increase in transport volumes, especially in road transport. The latest figures show that 10 of the 15 Member States are heading towards overshooting their agreed share of the EU GHG emissions target by a wide margin. This is the case for Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Big increases in emissions from 2000 to 2001 occurred in Austria (+4.8%) and Finland (+7.3%). Initial analysis indicates these were partly due to the cold winter but also to lower rainfall which cut hydropower production in both countries and reduced Finland's imports through the Nordic electricity market. Consequently Austria and Finland had to increase their use of fossil fuels for power and heat production. Ireland, Spain and Portugal are furthest away from keeping to their share of the EU target. Ireland's emissions in 2001 stood 31% higher than in 1990, well over double the 13% increase it is allowed between 1990 and 2008- 2012. For the first time in five years Spain's emissions decreased, by 1.1% compared with 2000, due to higher hydropower production which reduced use of fossil fuels for power and heat. Luxembourg shows the biggest GHG emissions cut of any Member State in percentage terms, decreasing by 44% since 1990. Germany, the largest EU emitter, has achieved the deepest reduction among the big Member States, with a 18% cut since 1990. Between 2000 and 2001 Germany's emissions rose by 1.2%, however. Details of EU and Member State emissions are shown in the Annex to this news release. EEA will publish an analysis of the emission figures and trends, together with latest projections for the year 2010, in autumn 2003. The inventory is available on the EEA's web site at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/technical_report_2003_95/en Notes to editors The 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will control industrialised countries' emissions of CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), plus three fluorinated industrial gases: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). The EU is responsible for around 24% of industrialised countries' man-made emissions of the six gases. The Protocol has yet to achieve the required number of ratifications to enter into force. A \"burden-sharing\" agreement between EU governments lays down differentiated emissions limits for each Member State with the aim of ensuring that the EU meets its overall 8% reduction commitment under the Protocol. The limits are expressed in terms of percentages by which Member States must reduce, or in some cases may maintain or increase, their emissions compared with the base year level. The national commitments are shown in Table 1 in the Annex. For the sake of simplicity, in this press release 1990 is treated as the base year for all gases. In fact, the inventory uses 1995 as the base year for the three fluorinated gases, as allowed for under the Protocol. This reflects the preference of most Member States. The EEA and its Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change compiles and quality-checks the annual inventory for the European Commission from data provided by Member States. The Commission has submitted it to the Secretariat of the UNFCCC. The inventory is published as EEA Technical Report No 95 and titled Annual European Community Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2001 and Inventory Report 2003. Submission to the Secretariat of the UNFCCC. Figures for 2000 and previous years have been revised because of recalculations by Member States using improved methodologies for estimating emissions and/or improved data on economic activity. The fall in total EU GHG emissions between 1990 and 2000 has been revised to 3.3% from 3.5% in last year's inventory. About the EEA The European Environment Agency is the main source of information used by the European Union and its Member States in developing environment policies. The Agency aims to support sustainable development and to help achieve significant and measurable improvement in Europe's environment through the provision of timely, targeted, relevant and reliable information to policy-making agents and the public. Established by the EU in 1990 and operational in Copenhagen since 1994, the EEA is the hub of the European environment information and observation network (Eionet), a network of around 300 bodies across Europe through which it both collects and disseminates environment-related data and information. The Agency, which is open to all nations that share its objectives, currently has 31 member countries. These are the 15 EU Member States; Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, which are members of the European Economic Area; and the 13 EU accession and candidate countries, namely Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, the Slovak Republic and Turkey. The EEA is the first EU body to take in the accession countries. Negotiations on EEA membership are also under way with Switzerland. Annex The following figures and tables give details, for each Member State and the EU as a whole, of trends in emissions of the six greenhouse gases up to 2001. Emissions from international aviation and shipping, and emissions from/removals by land use change and forestry, are not covered. Figure 1: Total EU greenhouse gas emissions in relation to the Kyoto target Table 1: Greenhouse gas emission trends and Kyoto Protocol targets for 2008-2012 1) Base year for CO2, CH4 and N2O is 1990; for fluorinated gases 1995 is used as the base year, as allowed for under the Kyoto Protocol. This reflects the preference of most Member States. 2) For Denmark, data that reflect adjustments in 1990 for electricity trade (import and export) and for temperature variations are given in brackets. This methodology is used by Denmark to monitor progress towards its national target under the EU \"burden sharing\" agreement. For the EU emissions total non-adjusted Danish data have been used. Figure 2: Distance-to-target (DTI) for EU Member States in 2001 (Kyoto Protocol and EU burden sharing targets) 1) The Danish DTI is +0,9 if Danish greenhouse gas emissions in the base year are adjusted for electricity trade (import and export) and for temperature variations. The distance-to-target indicator (DTI) is a measure of the deviation of actual greenhouse gas emissions in 2001 from the linear target path between 1990 and the Kyoto Protocol target for 2008-2012, assuming that only domestic measures will be used (see Figure 2). For example, Ireland is allowed a 13% increase from 1990 levels by 2008-2012, so its theoretical \"linear target\" for 2001 is a rise of no more than 7,2%. Its actual emissions in 2001 show an increase of 31,1% since 1990, hence its \"distance to target\" is 31,1-7,2, or 23,9 index points. Germany's Kyoto target is a 21% reduction, so its theoretical \"linear target\" for 2001 is a decrease of 11,5%. Actual emissions in 2000 were 18,3% lower than in 1990, hence its distance to target is 18,3-11,5, or 6,8 index points. The EEA's evaluation of progress up to 2001 is reflected in \"smileys\" according to the distance-to-target indicator in 2001. The following rating system is used: Positive contribution to EU trend: the negative distance-to-target indicator means that the Member State is below its linear target path Negative contribution to EU trend: the positive distance-to-target indicator means that the Member State is above its linear target path", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/ghg-2003-en"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0885", "date": "2003-05-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EU greenhouse gas emissions rise for second year running", "text": "Read more", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/20030506082951"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0886", "date": "2003-05-05", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "From the Europa website: Commissioner Wallstr\u00f6m calls for more stringent measures and policies to cut EU greenhouse gas emissions", "text": ".

The product of a collaboration between the European Environment Agency, the Agriculture and Environment Directorate-Generals, Eurostat, and the Joint Research Centre, the publication focuses on use of the Land Use/Cover Area Frame Statistical Survey (LUCAS) for building landscape and agri-environmental indicators. It also extends the analysis of independent and joint use of land cover information, administrative data and geo-referenced statistical surveys which are important for providing information on fluxes, stocks and pressure indicators and explores data sets EU-wide. Topics range from specific ones, i.e. bird diversity, to a complete land cover classification. The results of the survey found that existing data sets already contain a lot of information leading to the computation of agri-environmental indicators, and that intensification of a LUCAS type survey appears as a leading objective. It also observes that the integration of different data sets is possible and stresses the importance of data being available at periodic intervals.

This is the headline message of a new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA), Paving the way for EU enlargement: Indicators of transport and environment integration. The report examines progress made in the transport sector in implementing the principle, adopted by EU leaders at their Cardiff summit in 1998, of integrating environmental concerns into other policy areas. Based on a set of key indicators of progress - or lack of it - the report finds that transport trends in both the EU and accession countries are moving away from, not closer to, the main environmental objectives of EU policies on transport and sustainable development. These call for breaking the close link between economic growth and transport expansion, as well as stabilising the \"modal split\u201d -- the market shares of the different transport modes - at 1998 levels by 2010, then shifting traffic from the roads back to rail and inland waterways. The report shows, for instance, that in the EU and accession countries energy consumption by transport and the associated emissions of greenhouse gases are increasing rapidly, mainly due to growth in road transport. Another indicator shows land-take by transport infrastructure is rising and increasing pressures on designated nature protection areas. In the accession countries the environmental pressures from transport are still less than in the EU, but this favourable position is changing fast: Transport volumes in the accession countries, which fell significantly following the economic recession of the early 1990s, are now rising again as economies recover. By 1999 volumes were almost back to their 1990 levels, and this trend is expected to continue; Railways' share of freight and passenger traffic remains well above EU levels but overall transport infrastructure in the accession countries is evolving towards a road-oriented system. This will make it harder to maintain a substantial market share for rail; The transport sector's energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are three to four times lower than EU levels on a per-capita basis but, as in the EU, are growing rapidly; Road and rail networks are less dense than in the EU, causing less fragmentation of the land, but motorway lengths have almost doubled over the past 10 years. On a brighter note, the accession countries' transport emissions of certain air pollutants fell at the beginning of the 1990s and, helped by fleet modernisation and improved fuel quality, stabilised in the second half of the decade despite rising transport volumes. However, while urban air quality is generally improving across Europe, urban populations remain exposed to pollution levels, from traffic as well as other sources, that pose a danger to health. Gordon McInnes, EEA Interim Executive Director, said: \"The analysis indicates that the main challenge for the accession countries is to maintain the advantage they still have in certain aspects of transport and environment while meeting society's need to improve living standards and consequent demands for increased mobility.\" \"It would be highly regrettable if this opportunity were lost. However, current trends in the accession countries are worrying. The EU Transport Council has invited these countries to adopt the EU's principle of environmental integration, but more needs to be done to ensure that this invitation is turned into action.\" The report's key messages are annexed to this news release. The report in full and a summary are posted on the EEA web site at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/environmental_issue_report_2002_24. Printed copies will be available on request from next month. Notes for editors - The accession countries are Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic. For the purposes of this report, Turkey, which is also a candidate for EU membership, is also considered an accession country. - The report, also known as TERM 2002, is the third produced under the EU's transport and environment reporting mechanism (TERM) but is the first to include the accession countries. TERM is steered jointly by the EEA, Eurostat, the European Commission's statistics office, and the Commission's Directorates-General for Transport & Energy and Environment.

There is concern about the fate of rock ecosystems (e.g. the Cies Islands and the rocky coastlines in the area), and especially about the coral and sponge colonies. Also affected are the rich tidal zones (eg. the Umia-Grove tidal area) and the estuaries, beaches, and wetlands that are protected habitats under the Ramsar Convention (e.g. the Corrubedo zone). At least 250 birds of 18 different species have already been affected by the slick, according to conservationists. The impact is likely to be greater still given that it is now high season for migration of birds that nest in the United Kingdom and France, especially razorbills, guillemots, and gannets. During the winter the Costa da Morte is home to large colonies of birds because of its plentiful supply of food. The economy of the affected area is largely based on fishing, thanks to its rich fishing grounds. Two of these are located in the area already affected: the bight of Artabro, with its fishing grounds of hake, conger eel, sea bream, cod, horse mackerel, sardine, spider crab, and Dublin Bay prawn the bight of Fisterra, with rich fishing grounds of hake, conger eel, and Dublin Bay prawn As a result of the spill an order has been issued prohibiting fishing and catching of shrimp and other seafood in the settlements of Seixo Blanco, Caion, Malpica, Corbe, Laxe, Camari\u00f1as, Muxia and Fisterra. Some 5,000 households that base their livelihood on fishing - small net and tackle fishermen, and shrimp and seafood collectors - could be affected. The negative effect will be especially harsh since the period around Christmas is the time of highest income from catching seafood and fish. Many of these families have no other means of subsistence and have thus been deprived of their means of making a living by the disaster. The landscapes and natural beauty of the area also form the basis of a well-established rural tourism sector which brings additional resources to the local economy. This Christmas and the upcoming tourist season are likely to see a strong drop in tourism and visits as a result of the spill.

Ozone, the main component of summer smog, can cause serious health problems in humans and damage to ecosystems, agricultural crops and materials. It forms when certain air pollutants emitted by industry and transport react with sunlight. Ozone levels tend to be highest during warm, sunny weather, and are generally higher in southern Europe than in the north. Under a European Union directive, governments must inform the public whenever monitoring stations detect ozone concentrations above a critical threshold, set at 180 micrograms of ozone per cubic metre of air (180 \u03bcg/m3) averaged over one hour. Over the April-August 2002 period this threshold was exceeded in 11 of the 15 EU Member States and in six out of 12 other European countries that supplied data, a preliminary evaluation shows. An exceedance occurred in one or more of these 27 countries on 120 of the 153 days covered. June and July saw the highest numbers of exceedances. The report has been sent for information to EU environment ministers for their meeting on 17 October. The public information threshold was breached in France, Greece, Italy and Spain over all five months monitored. Total exceedances were highest in southern France, Italy's Po Valley and central Italy. Austria, Germany and Switzerland saw exceedances in four consecutive months while the Netherlands and the Czech Republic recorded exceedances in three consecutive months. Greece reported the highest number of days with exceedances -- 68 -- followed by France (56), Italy (52) and Spain (48). However, these totals do not necessarily provide a fair comparison since the number of monitoring stations differs widely from country to country. Switzerland and Greece had the highest proportion of stations reporting exceedances, at 77% and 70% respectively. The 10 countries that recorded no exceedances of the public information threshold were Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Romania and Sweden. For Ireland and Finland, 2002 marks the sixth consecutive year without exceedances. Public authorities are also required to issue public health warnings if ozone concentrations rise above a level of 360 \u03bcg/m3, averaged over one hour. In June 2002 this level was exceeded at three monitoring stations in Spain and at one in France and Italy respectively. The highest concentration recorded this summer was 391 \u03bcg/m3, at Puertollano in Spain on 22 June. In 2001 the highest concentration was 470 \u03bcg/m3, reported at a Spanish station last November. A new ozone directive taking effect next year will, among other things, introduce an \"alert\u201d threshold at 240 \u03bcg/m3. Around seven per cent of this year's exceedances of the public information threshold exceeded the future alert threshold. When the alert threshold is exceeded governments will have to set in train action plans aimed at achieving an immediate reduction of ozone pollution, where feasible. The average of the maximum concentration recorded during this year's exceedances of the public information threshold is slightly higher than in 2001 but the average duration of exceedances is lower. Such year-to-year variations largely reflect the quality of summer weather and changes in the extent of the monitoring network. Notes to editors Ozone formation and destruction is dependent on emissions and concentrations of the pollutants, or \"precursors\u201d, that contribute to it -- mainly volatile organic compounds (VOCs), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and carbon monoxide -- and on the amount and intensity of sunlight. Human exposure to elevated ozone concentrations can give rise to adverse effects on the breathing system and decreases in lung function. Symptoms observed during smog events are coughing, chest pain, difficulty in breathing, headache and eye irritation. Exposure of ecosystems and agricultural crops to ozone results in visible injury to foliage and reductions in crop yield and seed production. Adverse effects on vegetation can be noted at relatively low ozone concentrations, which occur frequently in Europe. The EU directive on air pollution by ozone, Directive 92/72/EEC, was adopted in 1992 and entered into force in March 1994. It establishes procedures for harmonising monitoring of ozone concentrations, exchange of information, communication with and alerting of the population regarding ozone levels and optimising action to reduce ozone formation. It will be replaced from 9 September 2003 by a new directive on ozone in ambient air, 2002/3/EC, which includes an \"alert threshold\u201d of 240 \u03bcg/m3. Information on the ozone situation in 2002 is partly based on provisional (non-validated) monitoring data, so the results should be regarded as preliminary. The evaluation takes the form of an EEA report to the European Commission called Air pollution by ozone in Europe in summer 2002: Overview of exceedances of EC ozone threshold values during the summer season April-August 2002. The report was prepared by the EEA's Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change. The report is posted on the EEA's web site at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/topic_report_2002_6 A day on which a threshold is exceeded for at least one hour is counted as one exceedance. Besides the 15 EU Member States, the countries which provided information for this year's report were Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland. A total of 1718 monitoring stations across these 27 countries are assumed to have been operational during the summer 2002 season. About 33% of the stations reported one or more exceedances of the public information threshold. About the EEA The European Environment Agency is the main source of information used by the European Union and its Member States in developing environment policies. The Agency aims to support sustainable development and to help achieve significant and measurable improvement in Europe's environment through the provision of timely, targeted, relevant and reliable information to policy-making agents and the public. Established by the EU in 1990 and operational in Copenhagen since 1994, the EEA is the hub of the European environment information and observation network (EIONET), a network of some 300 bodies across Europe through which it both collects and disseminates environment-related data and information. The Agency, which is open to all nations that share its objectives, currently has 29 member countries. These are the 15 EU Member States; Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, which are members of the European Economic Area; and 11 of the 13 countries in central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean area that are seeking accession to the EU -- Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic. Their membership makes the EEA the first EU body to take in the candidate countries. It is anticipated that the two remaining candidate countries, Poland and Turkey, will ratify their membership agreements within the next few months. This will take the Agency's membership to 31 countries. Negotiations with Switzerland on membership are also under way.

The UNEP.Net system was initiated in 2001 to support the integrated environment assessment process, most notably UNEP\u0092s Global Environmental Outlook (GEO) series. The system is developing information portals for major environmental issues at global and regional levels, by linking and presenting vital graphics, core data sets and background material for efficient reporting and sound decision-making. The European Portal benefits considerably from the work of the European Environment Agency (EEA) in Copenhagen, as well as from other partners in the region. EEA has long-standing experience in environment assessment, reporting and networking in (mostly western) Europe, as witnessed by numerous authoritative publications and information systems which cover the European environmental situation.

Energy is central to social and economic well-being, but its production and consumption put considerable pressures on the environment. These include contributing to potentially dangerous changes in the global climate, damaging natural ecosystems, tarnishing the built environment and harming human health. \"The report shows that, while there have been some successes, overall progress in building environmental protection needs into energy policy has so far been insufficient,\" said Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n, EEA Executive Director. He added: \"It also demonstrates that some countries and sectors in the EU are doing much better than others. The EU could improve its overall record if those Member States whose performance is below average were to learn from the leaders. \"There is scope for further improvement even in areas where the EU is already ahead of the United States, such as the energy intensity of the economy and emissions of climate-altering greenhouse gases,\" Mr Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n continued. EU emissions of greenhouse gases fell by 3.5% between 1990 and 2000, but without additional counter-measures they are likely to rise back to around their 1990 level by the year 2010. This is because of a projected increase in energy-related emissions, driven mainly by strong demand for transport fuels. The EU would consequently be at risk of missing its target, set under the Kyoto climate change Protocol, of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to 8% below their 1990 levels by the 2008-2012 period. Furthermore, energy consumption levels are expected to continue increasing beyond 2010. This will make greenhouse gas emission cuts difficult to achieve unless policy action is taken now to change long-term patterns of energy production and consumption. The report uses indicators of progress to assess how effectively environmental policies and concerns are being integrated into energy policies in the EU and its Member States. Integrating the environment into other policies is a stated goal of the EU treaty. Energy and Environment in the European Union points out that, despite increases in energy taxation, most energy prices in the EU have dropped since 1985. The report warns that this trend is likely to discourage energy saving efforts and may even encourage energy consumption unless policies are put in place to improve energy demand management and integrate energy's \"external\" costs - to the environment and human health - into its price. The external costs of electricity, for example, are estimated at 1-2% of the EU's gross domestic product. On the brighter side, the report shows that measures to cut air pollution from energy use have been successful and that discharges of oil into the sea have been reduced, although they still put significant pressure on the marine environment. Manufacturing industry has successfully \"decoupled\" its energy consumption from its economic growth, but it is the only sector to have done so. Its energy consumption in 1999 was about the same as in 1990. Another positive element is that several countries have led the way in demonstrating the effectiveness of specific measures in promoting growth in renewable energy and in improving energy efficiency. Mr Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n said: \"I am convinced that this first report on energy and the environment will prove its added value for the governance of energy policy. The successes and failures it highlights should help to make the case for implementing policies, for example in the area of taxation, to steer the liberalisation of energy markets towards sustainability.\" The report's main findings include the following: Energy prices generally fell between 1985 and 2001 despite increases in taxation. This created little incentive for energy saving, and overall energy demand increased. Subsidies continue to distort the energy market in favour of fossil fuels, even though the pressures these impose on the environment are well known. While innovation is needed to help develop less-polluting technologies, spending on energy research and development fell by around 30% between 1990 and 1998. Energy consumption rose by an average of 1.1% a year between 1990 and 1999, mainly because of growth in transport but also in the household and services sectors. Growth is expected to continue to 2010, though at a lower rate, as an agreement by the car industry to improve vehicle fuel efficiency yields results. Improvements in energy efficiency have been slow, but some countries have demonstrated the potential benefits of good strategies and practices. With the exception of manufacturing industry, no sector has \"decoupled\" its energy consumption from its economic development sufficiently to stop consumption from growing. At 1.9% per year, electricity consumption grew faster than final energy consumption between 1990 and 1999. This trend is expected to continue. The share of electricity produced from combined heat and power (CHP) increased from 9% in 1994 to almost 11% in 1998, but faster growth is needed to meet the EU's indicative target of an 18% share by 2010. Preliminary information suggests that CHP's share of electricity declined between 1998 and 2001. Fossil fuels continue to dominate energy use but environmental pressures have been limited by a switch from coal and lignite to relatively cleaner natural gas. However, no further switching is expected after 2010. Renewable energy output grew by an average 2.8% per year between 1990 and 1999 but its share of total energy consumption grew only slightly, from 5.0% to 5.9%, because total consumption also rose. Projections of future energy demand imply that the annual rate of growth in renewable energy needs to more than double, to 7%, if the EU's indicative target of a 12% share by 2010 is to be met. Experience in some Member States suggests that certain support measures can accelerate growth. Similarly, the growth rate of electricity produced from renewable energy sources (2.8% per year between 1990 and 1999) needs roughly to double if the indicative target of raising renewables' share of EU electricity consumption to 22.1% by 2010 is to be reached. Total EU greenhouse gas emissions fell by 3.5% between 1990 and 2000 but energy-related emissions, by far the largest component, fell by much less. This makes significant reductions in total emissions unlikely in the medium term. The fall in energy-related greenhouse gas emissions over the last decade was achieved through considerable reductions by the manufacturing and energy supply sectors, such as the electricity sector. These reductions were mostly offset by growth in transport. Measures taken to reduce atmospheric pollution from energy use are proving successful, with a number of Member States on track to meet EU targets for reducing emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and non-methane volatile organic compounds by 2010. The electricity sector significantly reduced its emissions of acidifying pollutants and greenhouse gases, mainly as a result of the switch from coal and lignite to natural gas and the introduction of specific measures to address acidifying emissions. Improved efficiency and an increase in the share of electricity from nuclear energy and renewables also contributed to this development, though in a much smaller way. Highly radioactive waste from nuclear power production continues to accumulate, and a generally acceptable disposal route has yet to be identified. Oil discharges from coastal refineries, offshore installations and maritime transport have been reduced but still place significant pressures on the marine environment. The report can be downloaded from the EEA web site at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/environmental_issue_report_2002_31. Notes for Editors The 3.5% reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2000 compares with an increase by the United States over the same period of 21%. Neither figure takes account of possible absorbtion of carbon by \"sinks\" such as forests. The US increase was 14% if account is taken of sinks. The greenhouse gases controlled by the Kyoto Protocol are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), plus three fluorinated industrial gases: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Energy-related emissions are emissions from the combustion of all fuels used for energy. Final energy consumption is the energy consumption of the transport, household, agriculture and services sectors. It includes the consumption of converted energy (ie electricity, publicly supplied heat, refined oil products, coke, etc) and the direct use of primary fuels, such as natural gas and certain renewable sources (eg solar heat and biomass). Renewable energy can produce both electricity and heat. Renewable energy sources include solar, wind, biomass and waste, hydropower (large and small schemes) and geothermal. Combined heat and power plants not only generate electricity but also make use of some of the heat that is produced and would otherwise be lost. This is important for the environment as it results in increased energy efficiency. Sulphur dioxide (SO2), emitted when sulphur-containing substances such as coal and oil are burned, contributes to acidification. Nitrogen oxides (NOx), emitted when fossil fuels are burned, contribute to both acidification and ground-level ozone pollution. Acidification is caused by the deposition of acidifying substances that can damage buildings and environmental media, such as freshwater systems, forests, soil and natural ecosystems, and is also linked to adverse health effects. Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), emitted by a wide range of sources in industry, transport, households and agriculture, contribute to ground-level ozone pollution. About the EEA The European Environment Agency is the main source of information used by the European Union and its Member States in developing environment policies. The Agency aims to support sustainable development and to help achieve significant and measurable improvement in Europe's environment through the provision of timely, targeted, relevant and reliable information to policy-making agents and the public. Established by the EU in 1990 and operational in Copenhagen since 1994, the EEA is the hub of the European environment information and observation network (EIONET), a network of some 300 bodies across Europe through which it both collects and disseminates environment-related data and information. The Agency, which is open to all nations that share its objectives, currently has 29 member countries. These are the 15 EU Member States; Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, which are members of the European Economic Area; and 11 of the 13 countries in central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean area that are seeking accession to the EU - Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic. Their membership makes the EEA the first EU body to take in the candidate countries. It is anticipated that the two remaining candidate countries, Poland and Turkey, will ratify their membership agreements within the next few weeks.

Environmental signals 2002, launched today at a series of events in Brussels, points to positive overall trends across the European Union in emissions of climate-changing greenhouse gases and generation of waste, as well as to confirmed reductions in water and air pollution. Greenhouse gas emissions are 3.5% lower than in 1990, even if they showed a slight rise in the year 2000; emissions of several air pollutants have been substantially reduced; the total amount of waste, though still increasing, appears to be growing more slowly than the economy; and the introduction of many new sewage treatment plants is cutting polluting discharges to rivers and other water bodies. However, these overall reductions are in many cases due to large cuts in only a few countries or economic sectors, the report cautions. Many countries and some sectors have not contributed to the positive trends, making progress patchy. And time-lags before these falls translate into improvements in the quality of the environment, combined with high background concentrations of pollutants from past emissions and sources elsewhere, mean that the impact of these pressures remains a concern. Consequently, large areas of natural habitats and agricultural land are still exposed to acidificaton. There is little sign that eutrophication is becoming less of a problem in coastal waters. And a substantial proportion of Europe's urban population remains exposed to high concentrations of harmful ground-level ozone and fine particles. Pressure on some natural resources is continuing to increase. This is particularly the case for fisheries. Despite an overall decline in fleet capacity, continued over-fishing is putting many of the commercially important European fish stocks at high risk of collapse. Land resources also remain subject to significant pressures, such as urban sprawl and the expansion of transport infrastructure. Over the last 20 years the built-up area in major western and eastern European countries has increased by some 20%, much faster than EU population growth (6%). This has caused loss or disturbance of natural areas and significant fragmentation of animal and plant habitats in most of Europe. Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n, EEA Executive Director, said: \"There is still a long way to go to ensure environmental issues are accorded due weight in the decision-making process alongside economic and social considerations. \"Providing environmental information such as this annual review of the state of the environment is therefore essential if policies and other initiatives are to be reviewed, reorientated and improved to ensure they contribute to the ultimate goal of a more sustainable Europe.\u201d He continued: \"Annual environmental reviews do not generally reveal dramatic changes in the state of the environment: their value lies in the identification of underlying trends and expectations of change, and the provision of early warnings of potential concerns. \"This year's report shows a mixed picture for the issues covered, without major changes in the state of the environment since the first Environmental signals report was published two years ago. \"However, to a certain extent the conditions for future change are emerging at the political level in the EU. This is thanks to the adoption of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy, finalisation of the Sixth Environment Action Programme and the continuing drive to integrate environmental concerns into sectoral policies, even if results have sometimes been disappointing.\u201d Mr Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n drew three main conclusions from Environmental signals 2002: The process of \"dematerialisation\u201d -- improving quality of life while reducing consumption of energy and materials -- which was anticipated with the transition to a more service-oriented economy has not yet been fully exploited. Some environmental pressures continue to be closely tied to economic development. Examples are greenhouse gas emissions from transport and tourism; land and soil degradation; energy and resource consumption by households; and reduction of stocks by fishing. Other pressures, such as mining and industrial waste, are growing more slowly than the economy but still increasing in absolute terms. On average the EU is using energy more efficiently, but it is still not reducing energy consumption in absolute terms. Also, while some countries have shown that targets, such as increasing the share of renewable energy in their energy mix, can be met, others have seen their energy efficiency deteriorate. The successful expansion of renewable energy is being undermined by an overall increase in the consumption of energy, especially electricity. Households' contribution to environmental pressures is often overlooked. As consumption levels continue to rise in parallel with disposable income, the need to help consumers make informed choices is becoming increasingly important. Eco-labelling and information dissemination, such as campaigns to encourage energy savings, are growing but their use remains marginal. The full text of Environmental signals 2002, as well as a summary, are available for download from the EEA web site at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/environmental_assessment_report_2002_9/. Notes for Editors Acidification is the deposition of acidifying substances that can damage environmental media such as freshwater systems, forests, soil and natural ecosystems. The acidifying substances originate largely from man-made emissions of three gaseous pollutants: sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ammonia. Eutrophication is the excessive enrichment of waters with nutrients, causing adverse biological effects which lead to depletion of the waters' oxygen content, consequently inhibiting their ability to support animal and plant life. The EU has set indicative goals of increasing renewable energy sources' share of total energy consumption to 12% and their share of electricity consumption to 22.1%, both by 2010.

The celebration took the form of a high-level conference attended by the European Commissioner for Environment and ministers, deputy ministers, ambassadors and Management Board members from most of the EEA\u0092s member and observer countries. The Copenhagen-based Agency, the main European-level provider of environmental information to policy-makers and the public, is the first European Union body to open its doors to the 13 countries that have applied for EU membership. Eleven of the countries became EEA members during 2001. They are: Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic. Turkey\u0092s representative at the conference said his country would complete its EEA membership formalities by the end of May. It is anticipated that Poland will also do so within the coming weeks. The enlargement event was preceded on 16 May by a conference focussing on past, present and future environment and sustainable development information needs, followed by a dinner for participants in the two conferences. Speakers at all three events took the opportunity to thank Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n for his service as Executive Director over the eight years since the Agency became operational in mid-1994, and to congratulate him on his and the EEA\u0092s achievements. At his own request, Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n is leaving the Agency when his contract expires at the end of May. Speakers at the 16 May conference, Towards a knowledge-based sustainable society, were as follows: Stanley Johnson, consultant, former Member of the European Parliament, former European Commission environment policy official Svend Auken, Member of Danish Parliament, former Minister of Environment Barbara Young, Chief Executive, Environment Agency of England and Wales Klaus T\u00f6pfer, Executive Director, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), by recorded video Frits Schlingemann, Director, UNEP Regional Office for Europe James Edwards, Executive Secretary, Global Biodiversity Information Facility Professor Philippe Bourdeau, former chairman of EEA Scientific Committee, former head of EEA task force Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n, EEA Executive Director Keynote speakers at the 17 May enlargement conference, From Dobris to Kiev and beyond, were as follows: Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, EU Commissioner for Environment Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n, EEA Executive Director Marko Slokar, Member of EEA Management Board, Slovenia Josef Sej\u00e1k, Member of EEA Management Board, Czech Republic (replacing Environment Minister Milos Kuzvart) Michael Constantinides, Permanent Secretary at Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment, Member of EEA Management Board, Cyprus Cemal Erbay, on behalf of Environment Minister Fevzi Aytekin, Turkey Prof Bedrich Moldan, Chairman of EEA Scientific Committee Hans Christian Schmidt, Minister of Environment, Denmark.

The EEA's Management Board welcomed today that Mr McInnes, as the Agency's second in command, will exercise the functions of Executive Director temporarily from 1 June. A British scientist with 25 years' experience of air pollution issues, Mr McInnes has been with the EEA since it started operations nearly eight years ago. He was a member of the task force that prepared the Agency's organisation and work programme before it was set up. As head of the EEA's Reporting and Networking Coordination department, Mr McInnes has been responsible in particular for coordinating the development of the Agency's information network, or EIONET, and of its Topic Centres (centres of thematic expertise). He also led a major internal reorganisation of the EEA completed last year. Mr McInnes's curriculum vitae is attached in Annex. Notes for Editors At its meeting on 14-15 March 2002, the Management Board interviewed candidates for the post of Executive Director proposed by the European Commission, in accordance with the EU Regulation governing the Agency. However, no candidate obtained the support of the two-thirds majority of the Board required for appointment. The Board therefore asked the Commission to submit a new shortlist of candidates for its consideration at the earliest opportunity. It requested the publication of a new call for applications for the post of Executive Director, based on broader criteria, in a wider range of printed and electronic media.

Total CO2 emissions from the 15 EU Member States were 0.5% lower in 2000 than 10 years earlier, the latest emissions inventory from the European Environment Agency shows. Less positive, however, is that EU emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases rose between 1999 and 2000, the most recent year for which EU-wide data are available. CO2 accounts for around 80% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions. CO2 emissions taken alone increased by 0.5% in 1999-2000, while emissions of CO2 and the five other gases controlled by the Kyoto climate change Protocol together rose by 0.3%. Under the Kyoto Protocol the EU is required to cut its combined emissions of the six gases to 8% below their 1990 level by the years 2008-2012. The latest inventory shows that in 2000 total EU greenhouse gas emissions stood 3.5% below their 1990 level. In 1999 they had been 3.8% lower, according to the most recent estimates. \"These figures make clear that in 2000 the EU suffered a slight reversal in its progress towards achieving its Kyoto target,\" EEA Executive Director Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n said. \"The situation is now that the EU is slightly less than half way towards reaching the target, with just over half of the time gone before the Protocol's first compliance period starts in 2008.\" One of the main reasons for the overall emissions rise from 1999 to 2000 was a 2.4% increase in CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production, due in part to an expansion of power generation from fossil fuels, especially coal, in the UK, the EU's second-largest emitter. Another reason was continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions in Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Belgium. The year-2000 figures mean that more than half of the European Union countries are still heading towards overshooting their agreed share of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions target by a wide margin. This is the case for Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Spain is furthest away from keeping to its share of the EU target: its emissions in 2000 stood 33.7% higher than a decade earlier, more than double the 15% increase it is allowed between 1990 and 2008-2012. At the other end of the scale Germany, the largest EU emitter, has achieved the greatest emissions cut among the big Member States, recording a 19.1% decrease over the decade. This is not far off the 21% reduction from 1990 levels that Germany is required to show by 2008-2012. Details of EU and Member State emissions are shown in the Annex to this news release. EEA will publish an analysis of the emission figures and trends in autumn 2002. The inventory is available on the EEA's web site at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/technical_report_2002_75/en. Notes to editors In October 1990 the EU committed itself to holding its year-2000 CO2 emissions at or below their 1990 level. It formalised the commitment when it signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in June 1992. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC will control industrialised countries' emissions of CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), plus three fluorinated industrial gases: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). The EU is responsible for around 24% of industrialised countries' man-made emissions of the six gases. The EU hopes the Protocol will receive enough ratifications to enter into force by the time the UN World Summit on Sustainable Development takes place in August-September 2002 in Johannesburg. A \"burden-sharing\" agreement between EU governments lays down differentiated emissions limits for each Member State with the aim of ensuring that the EU meets its overall 8% reduction commitment under the Protocol. The limits are expressed in terms of percentages by which Member States must reduce, or in some cases may hold or increase, their emissions compared with the base year level (1990). The national commitments are shown in Table 1 in the Annex. The inventory was compiled from data provided by Member States and quality-checked for the European Commission by the EEA and its Topic Centre on air and climate change. The Commission has submitted it to the Secretariat of the UNFCCC. The inventory is published as EEA Technical Report No 75 and titled Annual European Community Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2000. Submission to the Secretariat of the UNFCCC. The inventory represents the best available estimate of emissions and is based on the agreed methodology of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It covers emissions of the six Kyoto gases from all sources, with the exception of emissions from international aviation and marine transport, for which no internationally accepted methodologies exist yet, and of emissions from, and removals by, land use change and forestry. About the EEA The European Environment Agency is the main source of information used by the European Union and its Member States in developing environment policies. The Agency aims to support sustainable development and to help achieve significant and measurable improvement in Europe's environment through the provision of timely, targeted, relevant and reliable information to policy-making agents and the public. Established by the EU in 1990 and operational in Copenhagen since 1994, the EEA is the hub of the European environment information and observation network (EIONET), a network of some 600 bodies across Europe through which it both collects and disseminates environment-related data and information. The Agency, which is open to all nations that share its objectives, currently has 29 member countries. These are the 15 EU Member States; Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, which are members of the European Economic Area; and 11 of the 13 countries in central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean area that are seeking accession to the EU - Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic. Their membership makes the EEA the first EU body to take in the candidate countries.

This will take the Agency's membership to 31 countries. Negotiations with Switzerland on membership are also under way. Annex The following figures and tables give details, for each Member State and the EU overall, of trends in emissions of all greenhouse gases and CO2 up to 2000, excluding emissions from and removals by land use change and forestry. Figure 1: Total EU greenhouse gas emissions in relation to the Kyoto target Table 1: Greenhouse gas emission trends and Kyoto Protocol targets for 2008-2012 1)For the fluorinated gases some Member States have selected a base year other than 1990, as allowed for under the Protocol. 2)For Denmark, data that reflect adjustments for electricity trade (import and export) in 1990 are given in brackets. This methodology is used by Denmark to monitor progress towards its national target under the EU \"burden sharing\u201d agreement. For the EU emissions total non-adjusted Danish data have been used. 3)The EEA's evaluation of progress to 2000 awards \"smileys\u201d according to the distance-to-target indicator in 2000. The distance-to-target indicator (DTI) is a measure of the deviation of actual greenhouse gas emissions in 2000 from the linear target path between 1990 and the Kyoto Protocol target for 2008-2012, assuming that only domestic measures will be used. The following rating system is used: Positive contribution to EU trend: the negative distance-to-target indicator means that the Member State is below its linear target path Negative contribution to EU trend: the positive distance-to-target indicator means that the Member State is above its linear target path Table 2: CO2 emissions and targets for 2000 Figure 2: Distance-to-target (DTI) for EU Member States in 2000 (Kyoto Protocol and EU burden sharing targets) The distance-to-target indicator (DTI) is a measure of the deviation of actual greenhouse gas emissions in 2000 from the linear target path between 1990 and the Kyoto Protocol target for 2008-2012, assuming that only domestic measures will be used (see Figure 1). For example, Spain is allowed a 15% increase from 1990 levels by 2008-2012, so its theoretical \"linear target\" for 2000 is a rise of no more than 7.5%. Its actual emissions in 2000 show an increase of 33.7% since 1990, hence its \"distance to target\" is 33.7-7.5, or 26.2 index points. Germany's Kyoto target is a 21% reduction, so its theoretical \"linear target\" for 2000 is a decrease of 10.5%. Actual emissions in 2000 were 19.1% lower than in 1990, hence its distance to target is 19.1-10.5, or 8.6 index points. 1) The Danish DTI is 0.7 index points if Danish greenhouse gas emissions are adjusted for electricity trade in 1990.

Today in Brussels, on the occasion of the opening of Green Week 2002 by Romano Prodi, President of the European Commission, WHO and the European Environment Agency (EEA) jointly launch the monograph Children's health and environment: a review of evidence. \"This publication shows that European governments and institutions can collaborate to protect children from environmental threats. This goal lies at the very heart of sustainable development and is a challenge for the future of today's and tomorrow's generations,\u201d adds Dr Danzon. Up to 40% of the global burden of disease attributable to environmental factors is estimated to fall on children under the age of 5 years. As developing organisms, children are particularly vulnerable to the impact of environmental pollution. This is so for a variety of reasons, which include the following: early exposure has long-term consequences; children have a unique susceptibility to specific chemicals, and are exposed to substances in their immediate environment (such as soil and toys), particularly through their practice of picking things up and putting them into their mouths; and in proportion to their body weight, children breathe, drink and eat more than adults, with a consequently higher uptake of potentially toxic substances. Further, children have no choice about the factors to which they are exposed. They are also likely to be the most \"sensitive indicators\u201d for the environmental health of populations. On this basis, European ministers at the Third Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health in 1999 made a strong commitment to protect children and to develop key indicators for children's health and the environment. \"The European Union is setting the issue of children's environment and health high on the political agenda. The link between environmental degradation and poor health is clearly established, but we need further research in order to improve our understanding of these complex issues. The joint WHO--EEA publication is therefore a very welcome contribution in our efforts to prepare policy responses to the threats that a bad environment poses to children's health,\u201d remarks Ms Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, European Commissioner for the Environment. In the WHO European Region, the rise of hazards in the settings where children live, learn and play is increasing concern about the effects on children's health of the deterioration and contamination of the physical environment. \"Children are at risk of exposure to more than 15 000 synthetic chemicals, almost all developed in the last 50 years, and to a variety of physical agents, such as polluted indoor and outdoor air, road traffic, contaminated food and water, unsafe buildings, contaminants in toys, radiation and environmental tobacco smoke,\u201d points out Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n, EEA Executive Director. The spread of disorders possibly associated with environmental factors (asthma, injuries, neurodevelopmental disorders, cancer, and food- and waterborne diseases) is reaching unacceptably high levels in many cases. \"Close cooperation between environmental and health organizations is vital, not least to minimize duplication of efforts,\u201d adds Mr Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n.

This is one of the key conclusions from a new European Environment Agency report intended to help countries comply with the European Union's Landfill Directive, which will progressively limit the amount of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) that can be disposed of in landfills. The report, Biodegradable municipal waste management in Europe, draws together information on the production and management of BMW across western Europe and on the various strategies and instruments that are used to encourage its diversion away from landfills. BMW comprises food waste, garden waste, paper and cardboard, textiles, wood and other miscellaneous biodegradable wastes, such as wooden furniture, from households and other municipal waste sources. \"The experience of countries and regions that have succeeded in diverting large quantities of BMW away from landfill strongly suggests that an integrated package of options is needed at national level to achieve high diversion rates,\" the report finds. Specifically, countries with high rates of diversion of BMW from landfill employ a combination of separate collection (the collection of BMW separately from other waste streams), thermal treatment (mainly in the form of incineration), centralised composting and material recycling. The key to achieving both high diversion rates from landfill and high re-use, recycling and composting rates appears to be the provision of widespread separate collection facilities, together with the availability of adequate markets for the materials collected, the report says. It recommends that separation of BMW from other waste at source should be considered for inclusion in national strategies. Taxes and restrictions on the landfilling and incineration of specific waste streams are also components of successful strategies, it notes. Some countries have adopted or are considering outright bans on the landfilling of the entire biodegradable fraction of the municipal waste stream while others have introduced taxes that increase the cost of landfilling in order to make recovery options more economically viable. The optimum approach, according to the report, may be a combination of progressive restrictions on landfilling together with a taxation system that increases the cost of landfilling to the point where it is no longer financially attractive. The report underlines that establishing and maintaining adequate markets and outlets for compost and other end products is vital if national strategies are to be successful. Countries and regions investing heavily in separate collection risk creating a new waste management problem if reliable outlets are not available, it warns. The number of proven options available for treating BMW diverted from landfill is currently relatively small. The three main options are incineration with energy recovery (mainly of the biodegradable fraction of mixed waste), central composting (mainly of garden wastes and, to a lesser extent, food wastes) and material recycling (mainly of paper and cardboard wastes). More recent or emerging technologies such as gasification and thermolysis may also play a role in national strategies. The report highlights the need for each country to set up a monitoring and management system to allow it to track BMW production and management on a continuous basis. It points to considerable gaps in the information on BMW available at national level and underlines the importance of continuing efforts to establish harmonised systems of data collection and reporting \"so that reliable waste flow information becomes the norm and not the exception.\" The report is in three parts, the first two focussed on strategies and instruments for diverting BMW from landfill and the third on technology and market issues. All three are available on the EEA website at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/topic_report_2001_15/en. Notes for Editors The decomposition of biodegradable waste in landfills produces greenhouse gases and potentially toxic liquids which under certain circumstances can escape and pollute the surrounding environment. The report was prepared by the EEA's former European Topic Centre on Waste (ETC/W), the forerunner of today's Topic Centre on Resource and Waste Management (ETC/WMF). Topic centres are centres of expertise comprising international consortia of specialist organisations which are contracted to assist the EEA in carrying out its work programme. Council Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste requires EU Member States to reduce in stages the quantities of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill, according to the following timetable: By 16 July 2006, the weight of such waste going to landfill must be reduced to 75% of the total of such waste produced in 1995 or in the latest year before 1995 for which standardised data are available from Eurostat, the European Commission's statistics office; By 16 July 2009, a reduction to 50% of the total produced in 1995 or the latest year prior to 1995 must be achieved; By 16 July 2016, a reduction to 35% of the total produced in 1995 or the latest year prior to 1995 must be achieved. Member States which sent to landfill more than 80% by weight of their collected municipal waste in 1995, or in the latest year before 1995 for which standardized Eurostat data are available, may delay meeting each of the above targets by up to four years. In order to meet these targets, Member States are obliged to set up national strategies for reducing the amount of biodegradable municipal waste going to landfill. The Landfill Directive does not provide a definition of BMW. In the report BMW is taken to comprise the biodegradable fraction of the mixed waste that is collected door to door on a regular basis, plus biodegradable municipal waste that is collected separately from other waste streams, plus the biodegradable fraction of bulky municipal waste. In practice this covers food, garden waste, paper and cardboard, textiles, wood and other miscellaneous biodegradable wastes, plus bulky materials such as wooden furniture. Gasification is the production of gaseous fuels (methane and hydrogen) through high temperature incineration of waste. Thermolysis is a process of high-temperature chemical breakdown of waste that melts and solidifies the resulting ash. About the EEA The European Environment Agency is the main source of information used by the European Union and its Member States in developing environment policies. The Agency aims to support sustainable development and to help achieve significant and measurable improvement in Europe's environment through the provision of timely, targeted, relevant and reliable information to policy-making agents and the public. Established by the EU in 1990 and operational in Copenhagen since 1994, the EEA is the hub of the European environment information and observation network (EIONET), a network of some 600 bodies across Europe through which it both collects and disseminates environment-related data and information. The Agency, which is open to all nations that share its objectives, currently has 29 member countries. These are the 15 EU Member States; Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, which are members of the European Economic Area; and 11 of the 13 countries in central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean area that are seeking accession to the EU - Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic. Their membership makes the EEA the first EU body to take in the candidate countries. It is anticipated that the two remaining candidate countries, Poland and Turkey, will ratify their membership agreements within the next few months. This will take the Agency's membership to 31 countries. Negotiations with Switzerland on membership are also under way.

These issues do not appear amongst the priorities for the next 12 months agreed in Barcelona, even though the UN World Summit on Sustainable Development will take place in Johannesburg during this period. A decisive development, a certain climax, in the process had been expected in Barcelona. But instead of marking a \"top\" the summit appears to represent a \"stop.\" In Barcelona, both environmental information and the situation of the environment were generally ignored and the processes of environmental integration into economic and sectorial policies, sustainable development, and the inclusion of the environmental dimension in the socio-economic agenda of Lisbon seem to have been sidelined. The Barcelona conclusions could even call into question the EU's global leadership on environment issues and sustainable development and could affect the achievements and future of the Johannesburg World Summit, whose full potential can be realised only with the EU's leadership in view of the US's critical position. It seems that only a miracle at the Seville Summit in June can bring us back to the promising situation of Gothenburg and put back on track the process of progress towards more sustainable development initiated at the Luxembourg Summit in December 1997 (following a proposal by Swedish Prime Minister G\u00f6ran Persson) and continued at the Cardiff, Vienna, Cologne and Helsinki Summits, and finally in Laeken. Such a miracle could arrive late in the day for Johannesburg since the last preparatory meeting for the summit will take place in May. The positive conclusions of the Environment Council of 4 March 2002 (which appear in the annex to the Barcelona conclusions), the related European Parliament resolution, the letters to the Presidency from different Heads of Government and the Commission's own declarations had given some grounds for hope but were not adequately reflected in the Barcelona conclusions. The conclusions are certainly not the responsibility of the Spanish Presidency alone but of the Heads of State and Government. I believe it is an obligation for the Director of the European Environment Agency, which has followed all these processes and results through its reports, to point out this situation. I do so in the hope that awareness of the situation will make it possible again to continue progressing along the road on which Barcelona took a step backwards, to put the sustainable development process back in the promising situation that been built up over the last four years and to arrive in Johannesburg in August with a solid EU position that has a global impact. In this respect, the Seville Summit offers a further opportunity under the Spanish Presidency.

The meeting was chaired by Kees Zoeteman, chairman of the Board. The meeting was the first held since 11 countries in central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean basin that are seeking accession to the EU became members of the Agency with effect from 1 January 2002. It was also the last that Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n, EEA Executive Director since the Agency became operational in 1994, will attend in his current capacity as he is retiring from the post at the end of May 2002. Progress report The Management Board expressed strong support for the Agency's position that the European Commission's annual progress report to the spring European Council should in future give a stronger profile to the environmental dimension of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy. 2003 Budget The Board adopted the draft budget for 2003, proposing a Community subsidy of 21.38 million Euro. When this is combined with contributions from the 11 new member countries (as well as from Poland and Turkey when they become members in the near future) and from the three countries of the European Economic Area, the Agency's total budget would rise to 29.3 million Euro, compared with 25.0 million Euros this year. The increased budget will allow the Agency to work with most of the European countries and to support the process of EU enlargement by providing environmental information. Ongoing activities will be strengthened on a broad range of environmental issues such as climate change, transport, energy and agriculture. Activities will be extended in particular in the fields of environment and health, chemicals and technological risk. Election of a Vice-Chairperson Hendrik Vygen, Germany's member of the Board, was elected a vice-chair of the Board. Appointment of a new Executive Director postponed The Management Board issued the following statement: \"In accordance with the EU Regulation governing the Agency, the Management Board interviewed the candidates proposed by the Commission. However, no candidate obtained the support of the two-thirds majority of the Board required for appointment. The Board therefore asks the Commission to submit a new shortlist of candidates for its consideration at the earliest opportunity. It requests the publication of a new call for applications for the post of Executive Director, based on broader criteria, in a wider range of printed and electronic media.\" Forthcoming events The Board endorsed the Agency's plans to hold two major events in Copenhagen in May 2002: on 16 May, a high-level conference, titled Towards a knowledge-based sustainable society, to mark Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n's eight years as Executive Director; on 17 May, a celebration of the EEA's enlargement to the countries of central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean basin, with the participation of Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, EU Commissioner for Environment.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/Ann1016205018"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0945", "date": "2002-03-13", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Barcelona: where environment, economy and the social dimension meet", "text": "NEWS RELEASE Copenhagen, 13 March 2002 This week's European Union summit in Barcelona should see the environment at last given its rightful political place alongside economic and social issues, Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n, the Executive Director of the European Environment Agency, said today in the Catalan capital. \"For the first time ever EU leaders, at the Barcelona summit on Friday and Saturday, will take stock of progress in implementing their Sustainable Development Strategy, which seeks to balance economic, social and environmental needs within a unified framework,\" he said. \"This is an historic occasion that should see environmental requirements finally integrated, as an equal partner, into the ambitious socio-economic agenda that the European Council set in Lisbon two years ago,\" Mr Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n added. The European Environment Agency, the key provider of environmental information at European level, has contributed to the preparation of this important meeting under Spain's presidency by contributing data for, as well as assessments of, the indicators used to measure progress in the environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Strategy. Mr Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n continued: \"Indicators are crucial because you can manage only what you can measure. They also aid transparency and make policymakers more accountable to the public. \"At present the EU's sustainability indicators cover climate change, transport, energy production and use, threats to public health from urban air pollution and municipal waste management, but it is accepted that they will be refined and expanded over time. \"The EEA's latest update on the situation and trends in these issues, which we provided in a working paper earlier this month, shows that there has been progress towards reaching targets in some areas but that in general we are not there yet. \"Last week's agreement by EU Environment Ministers to ratify the Kyoto Protocol - the global community's first step in what is likely to be a long struggle to limit climate change - was excellent news and a great success for the Spanish presidency. But meeting the Protocol's targets for limiting and reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be a tough challenge, not least for Spain itself, since current trends and projections in many countries are worrying. \"Climate change, transport, energy, waste, tourism -- these and other driving forces and pressures on the environment are all reflected in the landscape in one way or another. Indeed, the landscape can be seen as a metaphor for the environment - sustainable development is mostly about sustainable use of land. \"EU Member States have already asked for the sustainable development indicators to be extended to cover land use and nature protection and biodiversity, among many other issues. \"For these reasons the EEA has chosen summit week and the summit city of Barcelona to organise two major land-related events, both of which begin today. \"A two-day workshop on the terrestrial environment aims to make progress towards defining indicators that will enable us to measure how sustainably land use, urban and coastal environments and soil are being managed, and thus eventually to improve their management. \"Our second event, a week-long exhibition on Europe's changing landscape, seeks to draw the public's attention to the growing challenges facing Europe's territory. After Barcelona the exhibition will go on tour to other parts of Spain. \"The key message is that Europe's land, the marvellous natural gift we have inherited, is under threat. Too often land is given only an economic value for development, construction of infrastructure or agriculture. But land is also a scarce and non-renewable asset which is highly valuable because of the amenities it offers to society and the vital functions it supplies to the economy and ecosystems. The EEA takes its responsibilities for informing and communicating about this issue very seriously. \"Land is of particular relevance to the Mediterranean basin, whose coastline is one of the most valuable pieces of real estate in the world - in both socio-economic and ecological terms - but also one of the most degraded and threatened. With Barcelona's tradition as a forum for discussing Mediterranean issues, it is entirely fitting that these events should be taking place here, on the eve of EU leaders' first-ever review of Europe's sustainability.\" Note to Editors The EEA working paper issued earlier this month is posted on the EEA website at http://org.eea.europa.eu/documents/speeches/speech_march_04.

A new EEA report published today, Late lessons from early warnings: the precautionary principle 1896-2000, examines how the concept of precaution has been applied -- or not -- by policy-makers over the past century when addressing a broad range of hazards linked to public health and the environment in Europe and North America. The report should help to improve mutual understanding between Europe and the United States on the use of the precautionary principle in policy-making. The debate has been marked by disputes over the safety of synthetic hormones in beef and of genetically modified plants and foods. \"Our central conclusion is that the very difficult task of maximising innovation whilst minimising hazards to people and their environments could be undertaken more successfully in future if the twelve \u2018late lessons' drawn from the histories of the hazards studied in this report were heeded,\u201d said Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n, EEA Executive Director. The report's 14 case studies, contributed by experts in their respective fields, provide many examples where inaction by regulators had costly and unforeseen consequences for human health and the environment or where early warnings, and even \"loud and late\u201d warnings, of problems were clearly ignored. The consequences range from the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people from the asbestos cancer mesothelioma, to the over-exploitation and subsequent collapse of fisheries in Canada, California and Scotland, with devastating impacts on local communities. The 12 \"late lessons\u201d drawn from the case studies include the following: Be realistic about how materials will be used and disposed of in everyday life. Don't allow regulatory authorities to be \"captured\u201d by vested interests. Avoid allowing one or two materials to monopolise the market -- as was the case with asbestos, CFCs and the group of versatile but harmful industrial chemicals known as PCBs -- by developing diverse ways of meeting human needs. When evaluating risks, ensure that not only all relevant specialist expertise is used but also \"lay\u201d and local knowledge. Follow up early warnings of problems with long-term environmental and health monitoring. Poul Harremo\u00ebs, Professor of Environmental Science and Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark and chair of the report's editorial team, said: \"The use of the precautionary principle can bring benefits beyond the reduction of health and environmental impacts, stimulating both more innovation, via technological diversity and flexibility, and better science. \"The case studies show how harmful and costly misuse or neglect of the precautionary principle can be,\u201d he continued. \"But over-precaution can also be expensive, in terms of lost opportunities for innovation and lost lines of scientific enquiry. \"If more account is taken -- scientifically, politically and economically -- of a richer body of information from more diverse sources, then society may be considerably more successful at achieving a better balance between innovations and their hazards in the future. The twelve \u2018late lessons' distilled from the case studies could help to achieve this better balance.\u201d Professor Harremo\u00ebs added: \"None of the lessons would themselves remove the dilemmas of decision-making under situations of uncertainty and high stakes. They cannot eradicate uncertainties or avoid the consequences of ignorance. But they would at least increase the chances of anticipating costly impacts, of achieving a better balance between the pros and cons of technological innovations and of minimising the costs of unpleasant surprises.\u201d The case studies cover the BSE or \"mad cow\u201d crisis; the use of synthetic hormones and antimicrobial agents to promote growth in farm animals; the use of the cancer-causing synthetic hormone DES to prevent miscarriages in women; over-exploitation of fisheries in the northern hemisphere; the use of medical radiation, asbestos, CFCs, and the chemicals benzene, MTBE (a substitute for lead in petrol), tributyl tin (an antifoulant for boats and ships) and PCBs; chemical contamination of North America's Great Lakes; and air pollution from sulphur dioxide. The report is an example of the kind of information that is needed to help the European Union and EEA member countries frame and identify sound and effective policies that protect the environment and contribute to sustainable development. It also seeks to help clarify the definitions of key terms, disagreement over which has added to the intrinsic difficulties of applying the precautionary principle in practice. Mr Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n said: \"The precautionary principle is not just an issue for the European Union: its potential impact on trade means that its application can have global repercussions. The current dialogue between the EU and the United States on the use and application of precaution is partly affected by confusion about the meaning of terms used in the debate. \"This report should contribute to a greater and shared understanding about past decisions on hazardous technologies and therefore, we hope, to improved transatlantic agreement about future decisions. It may also help the dialogue within both the EU and the United States, where there are healthy debates about the pros and cons of applying the precautionary principle.\u201d The 12 \"late lessons\u201d are: Acknowledge and respond to ignorance, as well as uncertainty and risk, in technology appraisal and public policy-making. Provide adequate long-term environmental and health monitoring and research into early warnings. Identify and work to reduce blind spots and gaps in scientific knowledge. Identify and reduce interdisciplinary obstacles to learning. Ensure that real world conditions are adequately accounted for in regulatory appraisal. Systematically scrutinise the claimed justifications and benefits alongside the potential risks. Evaluate a range of alternative options for meeting needs alongside the option under appraisal, and promote more robust, diverse and adaptable technologies so as to minimise the costs of surprises and maximise the benefits of innovation. Ensure use of \"lay\u201d and local knowledge, as well as relevant specialist expertise in the appraisal. Take full account of the assumptions and values of different social groups. Maintain regulatory independence from interested parties while retaining an inclusive approach to information and opinion gathering. Identify and reduce institutional obstacles to learning and action. Avoid \"paralysis\u201d by analysis\u201d by acting to reduce potential harm when there are reasonable grounds for concern.

Notes for editors The precautionary principle governs the use of foresight in decision-making in situations characterised by uncertainty and ignorance and where both regulatory action and inaction carry potentially large costs. The principle is enshrined in the European Union treaty. The most significant support for the principle in Europe has come from the European Commission's Communication on the Precautionary Principle, the European Parliament's resolution on the Communication and the Council of Ministers' Nice resolution on the precautionary principle, all issued in 2000. Late lessons from early warnings: the precautionary principle 1896-2000 is published by the EEA as Environmental Issue report no. 22.

A new report from the European Environment Agency identifies factors that can influence the success or otherwise of renewable energy projects. Renewable energies: success stories aims to facilitate greater use of renewable energy sources and contribute to efforts by the European Union and its Member States to meet targets for increasing power from renewables by 2010. The report focuses on how much each EU country managed to expand its use between 1993 and 1999 of a number of renewable energy technologies - solar photovoltaic panels, solar thermal heating, wind and certain uses of biomass (wood and crops). The study identifies essential elements for success in seven areas: political, legislative, fiscal, financial and administrative support, technological development, and information, education and training. It concludes that the key to success lies in the combined effect of support measures rather than in any single factor. The winning combinations vary from one technology to another. The success stories include the expansion of solar thermal energy and biomass-fuelled district heating in Austria, wind energy and biomass power in Denmark, photovoltaics, solar thermal and wind energy in Germany, photovoltaics and wind energy in Spain and biomass district heating in Sweden. \"This report helps point the way towards solutions.

The study and the executive summary can be downloaded from the EEA website at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/environmental_issue_report_2001_27/en/ Notes to editors The EU has set itself an indicative target of producing 12% of its energy (both electricity and heat) and 22.1% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2010. Indicative national renewable electricity targets for each Member State are also included in the recently adopted EU renewable electricity Directive (2001/77/EC). In the study, to be considered a success the use of a renewable energy technology in a specific Member State had to show at least one of the following: An absolute increase equivalent to at least 10% of the total EU-wide increase in output of that technology over the 1993-1999 period A percentage increase in output higher than the EU average increase for that technology over the 1993-1999 period. The countries and technologies meeting one or both of these criteria are shown in the table in the Annex.

There is no shortage of reporting obligations imposed on governments - in fact Member States often complain about \"reporting fatigue\" - but much of the information collected about environmental measures is of limited use in assessing their effects and effectiveness, the report finds. For the majority of EU measures, greater efforts are needed to demonstrate a causal relationship between them and their effects on the environment. The twin challenge facing Member States and the EU institutions is thus to devise a revised reporting system that will provide more information about the effects and effectiveness of EU environmental measures while also lightening the burden on governments by limiting collection and reporting requirements to the most essential types of information. This goal is reflected in the draft decision on the 6th environment action programme currently under discussion in the Council of Ministers and European Parliament. The new report, which can be downloaded from the EEA's web site at http://reports.eea.eu.int/rem/en , provides answers to the following questions as a contribution to the development of a more effective and streamlined reporting regime for the future: Why is it important to evaluate the effects and effectiveness of EU environmental policies? How far do reporting obligations in current EU environmental legislation help to assess effects and effectiveness? What information and methodologies do we need for evaluating effects and effectiveness? How can evaluations of effects and effectiveness be built into the design of legislation? Are there alternative mechanisms, other than through reporting obligations, for assessing effects and effectiveness?

The report has been submitted to EU environment ministers for their meeting on 29 October. Ozone can cause serious health problems in humans and damage to ecosystems, agricultural crops and materials. It forms when certain air pollutants emitted by industry and transport react with sunlight. Smog levels tend to be highest during warm, sunny weather, and are generally higher in southern Europe than in the north. A European Union directive on air pollution by ozone requires governments to inform the public whenever monitoring stations detect ozone concentrations above a critical threshold, set at 180 micrograms of ozone per cubic metre of air (180 microgramme/m3) averaged over one hour. A preliminary evaluation of the April-August 2001 period conducted for the European Commission shows that the public information threshold was exceeded in 11 of the 15 EU Member States and in five out of 10 other European countries that supplied data at the EEA's request (see table in annex for details). An exceedance occurred in at least one of these 25 countries on 101 of the 153 days covered. Reflecting more frequent warm and sunny weather in summer 2001, ozone concentrations were slightly higher this year than last. An in-depth analysis of data since 1994, however, shows a mixed trend of falling peak levels but rising average concentrations. These findings suggest, on the one hand, that reductions since 1990 in emissions of the pollutants that lead to ozone formation -- principally, oxides of nitrogen (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbon monoxide -- are feeding through into lower peak concentrations and so reducing the European population's short-term exposure to ozone. On the other hand, the increasing average concentrations of ozone, for which no unambiguous explanation exists, are increasing the public s long-term exposure to the pollutant. The average maximum ozone concentration during exceedances of the public information threshold this year was 200 \u0152g/m3. Exceedances lasted on average between 1.2 hours in April and 3.0 hours in June and August. Italy recorded the highest number of days with exceedances, 80, followed by France (58) and Spain (48). Of those countries reporting exceedances, Poland had the fewest exceedance days, with two. However, these numbers do not necessarily give a fair comparison because of wide variations in the extent of different countries' ozone monitoring networks. Belgium and France both had the highest proportion of stations reporting exceedances - 73%. The countries that recorded no exceedances of the public information threshold this year were Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden. For Ireland and Finland, 2001 marks the fourth consecutive year without exceedances. Governments are also required under the EU directive to issue public warnings if ozone concentrations exceed 360 \u0152g/m3, averaged over one hour. During the summer period this level was reached, but not exceeded, at one monitoring station in Spain. However, the warning threshold was exceeded in March during an ozone \"episode\u201d near the southern French port of Marseilles. Agreement was reached among the EU institutions this week, pending final approval by the European Parliament, on a new ozone directive that will include, among other things, the introduction of an \"alert\u201d threshold at 240 \u0152g/m3. When ozone concentrations exceed this threshold, governments will have to set in train action plans aimed at achieving an immediate reduction of ozone pollution where feasible. Of the exceedances of the public information threshold recorded this year, around five per cent also exceeded the future alert threshold. Notes to editors The report was prepared by EEA's European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change. The project was led by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in the Netherlands. Ozone formation and destruction is dependent on emissions and concentrations of the pollutants, or \"pre-cursors\u201d, that contribute to it -- mainly volatile organic compounds, oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide -- and on the amount and intensity of sunlight. Human exposure to elevated ozone concentrations can give rise to adverse effects on the breathing system and decreases in lung function. Symptoms observed during smog events are coughing, chest pain, difficulty in breathing, headache and eye irritation. Exposure of ecosystems and agricultural crops to ozone results in visible injury to foliage and reductions in crop yield and seed production. Adverse effects on vegetation can be noted at relatively low ozone concentrations, which occur frequently in Europe. The EU directive on air pollution by ozone, Directive 92/72/EEC, was adopted in 1992 and entered force in March 1994. It establishes procedures for harmonising monitoring of ozone concentrations, exchange of information, communication with and alerting of the population regarding ozone levels and optimising action to reduce ozone formation. Information on the ozone situation in 2001 is partly based on provisional (non-validated) monitoring data and so the conclusions drawn should be regarded as preliminary. The evaluation takes the form of an EEA report to the European Commission called Air pollution by ozone in Europe in summer 2001: Overview of exceedances of EC ozone threshold values during the summer season April-August 2001. Final version 22 October 2001. The report is posted on the EEA's web site at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/topic_report_2001_13/en In the report, a day on which a threshold is exceeded for at least one hour is counted as an exceedance. Besides the EU Member States, the countries which provided information on their observed exceedances were Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Slovakia and Switzerland. A total of 1,842 monitoring stations across these 25 countries are assumed to have been operational during the summer season.

At the same time, public authorities have a duty to ensure that public transport is efficient and user-friendly and that cyclists feel safe.\u201d Mr Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n continued: \"Our new report shows that although air quality in towns and cities i generally improving, large numbers of people are still exposed to high pollution levels, especially of health-endangering small particles from vehicle exhausts and summer smog. Every kilometre or mile not driven by car helps here too. \"At present, half of all car trips made are less than 6 km in length, which in congested urban areas can often be covered faster by cycling, while one in 10 trips are less than 1 km, a comfortable walking distance for many people. \"Choosing cars that are fuel efficient is another way for citizens to help protect their environment -- and to save on running costs. \"The fashion for four-wheel drive vehicles with high fuel consumption is a regrettable move away from the greater efficiency that is essential if we are to make our economies more environmentally sustainable. Moreover, these usually large and heavy vehicles intimidate other road users and when driven off-road pose a threat to the ecology of areas of the countryside that have been largely undisturbed until now.\u201d Notes to editors A total of 961 towns and cities across Europe, as well as in Canada and Cambodia, are participating in International Car Free Day on 22 September.

These are the 15 EU Member States; Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, which are members of the European Economic Area (EEA); and, since 1 August 2001, six of the 13 countries in central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean area that are seeking accession to the EU -- Bulgaria, Cyprus, Latvia, Malta, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic. Their membership makes the EEA the first EU body to take in the candidate countries. The remaining seven candidate countries -- the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Turkey -- will become members of the Agency once they, too, ratify their EEA membership agreements. It is anticipated that they will do so over the next few months, taking the Agency's membership to a total of 31 countries.

The European Environment Agency is publishing the report, TERM 2001, ahead of a joint meeting of EU ministers of transport and environment this weekend in Belgium. \"Overall, the report shows that transport in the EU is becoming less and not more environmentally sustainable,\u201d EEA Executive Director Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n said. \"Progress towards a more sustainable transport system has become imperative and efforts to integrate environmental considerations into transport policy have to be redoubled.\u201d Transport contributes to damage to the environment and human health by emitting significant levels of toxic pollutants and \"greenhouse\u201d gases, generating wastes and noise and fragmenting the countryside. Most of the report's key indicators signal unfavourable trends or show that there is still a long way to go to reach policy targets for \"greening\u201d transport. The report warns that current trends point away from achieving the EU's recently-announced objectives of breaking the link between economic growth and growth in transport, and of returning the market shares taken by rail, maritime and inland waterway transport to 1998 levels by 2010. As a shift towards greater use of cars and planes continues, passenger and freight transport is growing at a faster rate than the economy as a whole, bringing increasing threats to the environment and human health, it says. For example, growth in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from transport is jeopardising the EU's ability to meet its targets under the Kyoto Protocol on combating climate change. But there are also some positive trends, mainly due to advances in technology and fuels that have made new road vehicles less polluting. A significant improvement in urban air quality has resulted, although in many cities air quality still poses health risks and further improvement is needed. The energy efficiency of car transport has improved slightly over the past two decades, although low occupancy rates and the use of heavier and more powerful vehicles have partly offset fuel efficiency gains in new cars. There has been no increase, however, in the energy efficiency of freight transport by road and little corresponding change in rail or shipping. Air transport remains the least energy efficient mode of transport despite technological advances. The report argues that better integration of environmental considerations into all areas of transport policy-making is required to achieve progress towards a more environmentally sustainable transport system. Most EU countries have developed integrated transport and environment strategies or are doing so, but many of these have yet to be finalised, funded and implemented. In addition, national strategies are not always in line with EU strategies and policies. Most notable is the failure to implement the goal of integrating the costs of environmental damage, accidents and congestion into the prices charged for each mode of transport. However, there are signs of progress in that several Member States are now moving towards tax structures that differentiate between the various modes on the basis of their environmental costs, although implementation of these still faces many barriers. Another finding is that decisions on transport infrastructure are still being made mainly in response to problems of traffic bottlenecks, an approach that favours the expansion of road and airport infrastructure. \"The report shows that to restrain the growth in transport, efforts are also needed in other sectors,\u201d Mr Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n said. He added: \"Action is required in the tourism sector since tourism travel is the fastest growing category of passenger transport. And industry has an essential role to play in the development of more transport-efficient production and distribution systems and in the improvement of freight logistics.\u201d TERM 2001's findings and projections include the following: Between 1990 and 1998, transport sector emissions of acidifying gases fell by 20% and emissions of the pollutants that cause ground-level ozone \"smog\u201d -- oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) -- by 25%. However, extra efforts are needed - also in other sectors - to reach EU targets for reducing emissions of these substances. Energy consumption by the transport sector has increased by 47% since 1985, compared with 4.2% for the other economic sectors. Transport is responsible for 24% of the EU's total man-made emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas, with transport by road alone accounting for an 84% share of this. CO2 emissions from transport increased by 15% between 1990 and 1998. The number of cars scrapped each year in the EU's 15 current Member States is expected to grow from 11.3 million in 1995 to 17 million in 2015. Transport infrastructure is increasingly fragmenting the EU countryside. The length of the motorway network has increased by more than 70% since 1980, while that of conventional railway lines and inland waterways has fallen by about 9%. The EU car fleet grew by 64% between 1980 and 1998 to 451 cars per 1,000 inhabitants. Trucking now accounts for 43% of freight transport in terms of tonnage carried and distance travelled (total tonne-kilometres), against 33% in 1980. Short sea shipping has become quite successful for longer distances, accounting for 42% of total tonne-km. \"External\u201d costs of transport -- covering environmental damage, accidents and congestion -- are estimated at 8% of gross domestic product (GDP). Cars, trucks and planes have the highest external costs per unit transported. Several countries are establishing tax or charge systems to include these costs in transport prices. Transport fatality rates are falling, but road accidents still claim 41,000 lives a year. The number of people injured is about 40 times the level of fatalities and is falling more slowly than the fatalities total. It is estimated that more than 30% of the population is exposed to traffic noise levels that can be annoying or harmful to health.

The report, the third and final part of an assessment of sustainable water use, surveys the main natural and man-made causes of floods and droughts based on information and experience gathered from countries across western and central Europe. The economic cost of flood damage in this part of Europe has been estimated at EUR 99 billion between 1991 and 1995 alone. This does not include the cost of human deaths and injuries. The areas most prone to frequent flooding are widely distributed geographically: the Mediterranean coast, the Rhine, Seine and Loire valleys, the dyked areas of the Netherlands, the north German coastal plains, the Alpine valleys, the Po valley in Italy, some coastal areas of Portugal, the Danube and Tisza valleys in Hungary and the Shannon Callows (floodlands) in central Ireland. Many of these areas form part of Europe's economic heartland. Human interference or alterations to soil and vegetation within catchments can seriously affect the risk and impacts of floods. Between 1991 and 1995 the areas most prone to flooding tended to be those that have seen the greatest increase in urbanisation, such as the Mediterranean coast and the Rhine catchment. At the other end of the water spectrum, Europe is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the effects of droughts as pressure on water resources continues to grow. Demand for water across Europe increased from 100 km3/year in 1950 to 550 km3/year in 1990 and is forecast to have reached 660 km3/year by the end of the 20th century. Drought is a normal and recurrent feature of the European climate that is not restricted to Mediterranean regions but can occur in high- as well as low-rainfall areas and in any season, the report finds. Recent research on the impacts of climate change suggests that annual rainfall will increase in northern Europe but drop by about 10% elsewhere by 2050. The drier regions of southern and eastern European Europe show the greatest sensitivity to change. The report provides information on policy responses to floods and droughts and different countries' national strategies. It also includes descriptions of individual floods and droughts that give a detailed insight into the pressures and impacts of such extreme events and the measures taken to address them. In most cases droughts are identified as such too late and emergency measures taken are not effective. Little technical guidance exists for water management in situations of drought and the report concludes that further work is needed in this area. The report is posted on the EEA's website at http://reports.eea.europa.eu/Environmental_Issues_No_21/. Notes to Editors The report is titled Sustainable water use in Europe. Part 3: Extreme hydrological events: floods and droughts. It is published as Environmental issue report No 21. The report was prepared by the EEA and its former Topic Centre (centre of expertise) on inland waters. The project was led by the Centro de Est\u00fadios y Experimentaci\u00f3n de Obras Publicas (CEDEX, Spain), with the assistance of the Institute of Hydrology (UK), the Austrian Working Group on Water, the International Office for Water (France), the National Environmental Research Institute (NERI, Denmark) and the Phare Topic Link on inland waters (led by Vituki Consult, Hungary).

It is anticipated that they will do so over the next few months, taking the Agency's membership to a total of 31 countries. For reasons of administrative simplicity, full participation in the Agency's work by the new members joining today and other countries that ratify their EEA membership agreements this year will start on 1 January 2002. \"Today is an historic day for the European Environment Agency,\" said EEA Executive Director Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n.\u00a0 \"We are proud to be the first EU body to make enlargement a reality, and not least to welcome states that for most of the second half of the 20th century were separated by political barriers from the rest of Europe.\" He added: \"The candidate countries' membership of the EEA is a further important milestone in Europe's environmental reunification. As these nations move into the European mainstream, the great challenge is to ensure the continued protection and enhancement of their rich natural heritage and to help them avoid certain insensitive types of development that, as EEA reports regularly document, are putting such pressure on the environment in western Europe.\" The EEA's enlargement will make it a truly pan-European body, expanding the geographical area of its membership by 50% and the population it covers by 45%.\u00a0 Reflecting the different environmental characteristics of the additional area covered and the priorities of its new members, issues like water stress, transboundary air pollution, forests and biodiversity are likely to become even more important for the EEA. Enlargement will also bring a new focus on the sustainability of such regions as the Danube catchment area, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. While the Agency has been working with most of the candidate countries since 1996 on specific projects with support from the EU's PHARE programme, EEA membership will allow their full and permanent integration into the Agency's activities and decision-making. This will help to familiarise these countries with EU procedures prior to joining the Union and aid their compliance with EU legislation. Agency membership will give the candidate countries the tools to monitor their environment consistently.\u00a0They will also be in a better position to measure how effectively the new environmental laws they are putting into place ahead of EU membership are being implemented and how their natural areas and biological diversity are being preserved and enhanced. For the EEA, a more regular flow of data and information from the new member countries will allow improvements in the coverage and quality of its environmental and sustainable development assessments for policymakers.

The report gives an overview of the many publications issued during the year and other support provided to policy development and assessment in the EU. It also includes information on other activities, such as networking with institutions in EEA member countries and international organisations, and development of the Agency's web-based reference centre for environmental information. Finally, important developments in the mandate and organisation of the EEA itself are covered. Last year was a milestone for the Agency due to the publication of its first indicator-based reports, Environmental signals 2000 and the first report from the Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism (TERM). TERM sets the pattern for developing indicators on integrating the environment into other sectors, such as energy or agriculture. Indicator-based reports are the backbone of the Agency's future reporting strategy. Other major reports focussed on the Mediterranean (together with the UN Environment Programme's Mediterranean Action Plan), soils (together with UNEP), trends in greenhouse gas emissions and the use of eco-taxes. Negotiations for the 13 candidate countries in central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean area to join the Agency were initiated and successfully concluded during 2000, making the EEA the first EU body to open up to enlargement. Following ratification by both sides, the membership agreements for six countries \u0097 Bulgaria, Cyprus, Latvia, Malta, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia \u0097 will enter into force on 1 August 2001. It is anticipated that the agreements with the remaining countries will take effect over the coming months, taking the EEA's membership to 31. Formal participation in the Agency's work is expected to take effect from 1 January 2002 for all countries that have ratified the agreements by then. The Agency's website is now the main channel for disseminating reports. On average the site saw more than 100,000 user sessions and received almost two million hits per month during 2000. A new data service was launched to provide improved access to the data underpinning EEA reports. Seven of the Agency's eight Topic Centres \u0097 centres of expertise designated to carry out specific tasks \u0097 came to the end of their agreements with the EEA at the end of 2000 as planned. It was decided to concentrate work on fewer and more integrated centres for the next three-year period. Five new centres have been designated and started work this year on the following topics: Water Air and climate change Nature protection and biodiversity Waste and material flows Terrestrial environment.

The reorganisation will be implemented over the summer period and completed by 1 September. A new EEA strategy has been developed as part of the preparations for the reorganisation. There are four main reasons for the reorganisation: Enlargement: The EEA will be the first Community body to have the candidate countries as members. Today there are 18 EEA member countries and we expect to welcome 13-14 new member countries in the coming months. The organisation is therefore being extended and adapted to manage the increased number of member countries and the increased workload, larger budget and increase in staff that will result. Adjusting to the new EEA strategy: EEA has analysed the recent changes in Europe's environment policy agenda and revised its strategy to meet the needs of our key clients. The reorganisation takes the new strategy into account. Reform of the European Commission: Developments in the Commission's reform process have been followed closely and the EEA reorganisation reflects these upcoming changes. Evaluation of the EEA: Following the recommendations of an independent evaluation of the Agency conducted last year, the reorganisation aims at better balancing: short, medium and long term developments external relations, EEA management and Group management innovation and routine activities work on products and services EEA development and individual staff development. Furthermore the reorganisation aims to improve communication tools. The reorganisation As shown below, the new organisation will comprise the Executive Director's Office (EDO), Administration and Finance Department (ADM) and four Operational Programmes: Strategic Development and Institutional Relations (SDI), Environmental Assessment (EAS), Reporting and Networking Coordination (RNC) and Information Technology and Services (ITS). The four Operational Programmes will be subdivided where appropriate into Groups based on similar areas of expertise/activity. Line management will be carried out through the Programmes and Programme Managers will delegate some responsibilities to Group leaders.

In particular following comments from the European Commission representative, the Bureau invited the Agency to take the necessary steps to adapt its reporting strategy and activities to the developing political agenda, notably the 6th EU Environmental Action Programme and the conclusions of the Lisbon and Gothenburg summits, to ensure a regular input to the European Commission\u0092s spring synthesis report on progress in implementing the EU Sustainable Development Strategy. In practical terms, for each spring synthesis report the Agency would need to provide preliminary data on the previous year in the early autumn before the synthesis report and a final update a couple of months later. Cooperation between the Agency and Eurostat will also need to be clarified. EEA reporting strategy The Executive Director informed the Bureau that, following the Stockholm summmit\u0092s decision to review the EU\u0092s progress in all dimensions of sustainable development at the annual spring meeting of the European Council, it would be appropriate to consider these Councils as policy events of major importance for the EEA. The EEA therefore proposes to use the Environmental signals report series for publishing a selection of main indicators which can also be used for the spring sustainability review. For that purpose Environmental signals reports will be slimmed down to focus on key indicators, while other sectors and themes currently addressed by them will be highlighted in separate reports linked to their respective policy processes. Draft Annual Work Programme 2002 The Executive Director presented a first draft of the Agency\u0092s Annual Work Programme for 2002, which assumes that the 13 candidate countries in central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean basin will be EEA members by the start of the year. The first draft, presented to the Bureau for the guidance, is based on a core EU subvention of EUR 21 million and additional estimated resources of EUR 6.875 million from EFTA countries, new member countries, contributions from European Commission DGs and bank interest. The Executive Director pointed out that the draft work programme would need to be adapted in the light of the outcome of the Gothenburg Summit. EEA-DG ENV Memorandum of Understanding The Bureau considered a draft Memorandum of Understanding between the Agency and the European Commission\u0092s DG Environment which sets out guidelines for cooperation. The Bureau felt that signature of the MoU should take place by the end of 2001 at the latest. European Topic Centre (ETC) on Terrestrial Environment The Bureau approved the 2001 subvention to this ETC of EUR 400,000 and a technical annex laying down the work it is to carry out. At its meeting on 20 March the Management Board had designated the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) to lead the ETC consortium subject to improvement of the soil contamination and protection aspects of the UAB\u0092s proposal. In the light of subsequent discussions it was decided to strengthen the ETC by including the Austrian and Italian environment protection agencies, UBA and ANPA, among the ETC partners. The Bureau also took note of a verbal report on the functioning of the ETCs on air and climate change, water, nature and biodiversity, waste and material flows and collection of data sources.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/Ann994662702"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0964", "date": "2001-06-27", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EEA expansion on course following EU ratification", "text": "The European Environment Agency welcomes the European Union\u0092s ratification of agreements that will enable the 13 countries seeking accession to the EU to become members of the Agency within the next few months.

If environmental and sustainability aims and targets, such as those proposed in the EU's 6th Environment Action Programme, are to be reached, higher efficiencies in the use of materials and energy will be necessary. \"This in turn requires further actions to influence the character and scale of production and consumption across the various economic sectors. Taxation is a key tool for managing demand but it needs to be applied dynamically since financial stimuli become less effective as incomes rise.\" Environmental signals 2001 provides a snapshot of some of the myriad pressures on the environment in the EEA's 18 member countries, the driving forces behind them and, importantly, the complex linkages between them. The report, prepared for policy-makers and the public, is a major input to the 15-16 June Gothenburg summit, where EU leaders will take stock of strategies for integrating environmental protection into nine economic sectors and adopt the EU's first sustainable development strategy. The annual Environmental signals reports use key socio-economic and environmental indicators to assess progress in implementing environmental policies and integrating environmental considerations into other policy sectors. Such indicators bring transparency and accountability to policy-making and create a basis for fine-tuning policies for maximum effectiveness. Launched last year, the Environmental signals series is developing into the main indicator report on Europe's environmental sustainability and will thus play an important part in monitoring the 6th Environment Action Programme (6EAP). Pointing to positive developments as well as negative trends, the reports focus on selected sectors and issues. They are not intended to be as comprehensive as the EEA's five-yearly state of the environment reports. This year's Environmental signals examines the environmental impacts of households/consumption and tourism, which are covered for the first time, as well as the key transport, energy and agriculture sectors. In terms of environmental issues, there is a new focus on river water quality, hazardous substances in marine waters, soil contamination and grasslands, plus detailed updates on climate change, air pollution and waste. The report's findings include the following: Inputs into the north-east Atlantic of six important hazardous heavy metals and organic substances fell significantly between 1990 and 1998 EU emissions of the six Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gases fell by 2% between 1990 and 1998 (and subsequent data show a 4% fall to 1999, while emissions in the US rose by 11% in the same period) Waste generation continues to increase and remains closely linked to economic growth Demand for transport fuels is growing faster than overall energy demand Motorway construction claimed around 10 hectares of land every day between 1990 and 1998 Electricity from renewable energy sources increased by about 3% per year between 1989 and 1998, but the annual growth rate needs to rise to 5.5% to meet the EU's proposed target for 2010 Eco-labelling of tourist accommodation has increased significantly since 1990 but remains very marginal. Environmental signals 2001 also finds that \"eco-efficiency\" - the efficiency with which environmental resources are used to produce a unit of economic activity - has improved since 1990 in transport, energy supply and agriculture. This has resulted in falls in emissions of acidifying gases and ground-level ozone precursors from these sectors. However, gains in energy efficiency have been outweighed by the growth of these sectors. Following the decision taken at the Stockholm European Council in March to review progress in all dimensions of sustainable development at the EU's annual spring summits, the EEA intends to design and time future Environmental signals reports to contribute most effectively to that process.

The cut takes the EU half way towards achieving the Kyoto target of reducing its emissions of these gases to 8% below their 1990 level by the years 2008-2012. The EU is responsible for 24% of industrialised countries' man-made emissions of the six gases.[1] The EU reduction contrasts with an 11% increase in greenhouse gas emissions over the same period in the United States, which accounts for 40% of the industrialised world's man-made emissions.[1],[2] The EU's progress was helped by a 2.0% fall in greenhouse gas emissions in 1999, which came despite economic growth[3] of 2.5%. The emissions drop was due to a combination of favourable factors, some of which will not be repeated, however.[4] The annual inventory for 1990-1999 also shows that the EU remains on track to meet its commitment to stabilise emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the most important greenhouse gas, at 1990's level by the year 2000. In 1999, the latest year for which data are available for all member countries, the EU's CO2 emissions were 1.6% lower than in 1990. They fell by 1.4% between 1998 and 1999. CO2 accounts for around 80% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions. Despite these positive trends the EEA sees no room for complacency and warns that further major efforts to reduce emissions are needed to achieve the Kyoto targets. The favourable picture to date has been determined largely by considerable emissions falls in Germany and the United Kingdom, the EU's two biggest emitters, together contributing around 40% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions reductions - 18.7% in the case of Germany and 14.0% for the UK - are mainly the result of lower coal consumption due to a shift towards increased use of gas in power generation in both countries[5], the closure of industrial plant in eastern Germany following German unification and improvements in Germany's energy efficiency. However, this situation could rapidly change. Initial preliminary estimates indicate that in 2000 the UK's CO2 emissions increased by 2% and Germany's energy-related CO2 emissions rose by 0.2% from their respective 1999 levels.[6] In both cases, increased use of coal has been identified as the main cause. Moreover, on present trends, more than half of the other Member States are headed towards substantially exceeding their agreed share of the EU's total allowed emissions under the Kyoto Protocol.[7] This is the case for Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. The 1997 Kyoto agreement, which the EU hopes will receive enough ratifications to enter into force next year,[8] covers emissions of CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), plus the three fluorinated gases hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Following substantial improvements in Member States' reporting of emissions of the fluorinated gases, the latest inventory[9] includes EU totals for all six Kyoto gases for the first time. The inventory was compiled and quality-checked for the European Commission by the EEA and its Topic Centre on air and climate change on the basis of national data generated using measurement and modelling methodologies developed by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)[10]. The inventory includes emissions of the six gases from all sources, with the exception of emissions from international aviation and marine transport and emissions from, and removals by, land use change and forestry. No internationally accepted methodologies exist yet for monitoring these sources and sinks. For 1999 all Member States were able to supply data except Belgium and Luxembourg, for which emissions estimates have been used. The inventory will be published on the EEA's web site. Details of the emissions trends for the EU and each Member State are shown in the annex to this news release.

[4]The main reasons were the one-off introduction of technical measures to reduce N2O emissions at adipic and nitric acid production plants in France and the UK and HFC emissions from the UK HFC industry; a continuation of the shift from coal to gas seen during the 1990s, particularly in Germany and the UK; and relatively mild winters in Germany, UK, France and the Netherlands which reduced energy use for indoor heating. [5]Shifting from coal to natural gas reduces CO2 emissions because of the lower carbon content of natural gas and the overall higher energy efficiency of gas-fired power plants.

The national targets are given in Table 1 in the Annex.

The OECD Environmental Outlook builds on the EEA's own 1999 report Environment in the European Union at the turn of the century, which projected future trends in the EU to 2010. The OECD report confirms many of these trends while extending the projection for OECD countries to 2020. Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n, Executive Director of the EEA and a member of the OECD Advisory Panel for the Environmental Outlook, said: \"The EEA has provided considerable input to the OECD report and this collaboration has resulted in a welcome consistency of approaches and results. This consistency should prove very helpful to EU policy makers in formulating the action needed to address the many environmental threats identified in the report. \"The OECD's first outlook report is also significant for showing the extent to which the importance of environmental protection is increasingly penetrating the consciousness of individual economic sectors. \"In particular, it highlights the seriousness of the threat posed by climate change while at the same time bearing out the EEA's analysis that the cost of meeting the Kyoto Protocol targets can be very low. According to the OECD's report, the cost would be just 0.1% of gross domestic product if coupled with an international trading regime. \"We must hope that this message will help to change the US administration's view that the Kyoto Protocol is too costly to implement.\" Notes to Editors The European Environment Agency aims to support sustainable development and to help achieve significant and measurable improvement in Europe's environment through the provision of timely, targeted, relevant and reliable information to policy making agents and the public.

Households account for most of the water consumption in urban areas, and between half and two-thirds of the water they use is for flushing toilets, bathing and showering. Using technologies such as reduced-volume toilet flushes and water-saving devices on taps can cut water consumption for these needs by around half. However, such devices are not employed widely, probably due to a lack of information about such technologies and/or their relatively high price. Among the report's conclusions is that better public information is required about the need to reduce water use and the technologies available to do so. Producers of water-saving technologies could help with this task, it suggests. Metered charging of household water use and reducing leakage from the distribution network are essential elements of water demand management. Introducing metering leads to immediate savings in water use of an estimated 10-25% of consumption. Leakage losses can be very high - up to 75% in Albania, for example - but the heavy expense of tracing and repairing leaks can act as a disincentive to remedying these, the report recognises. The second in a three-part assessment of sustainable use of water in Europe that is being managed by the EEA, the report focuses on how management of water demand is being approached across Europe as well as on measures to increase the efficiency of water use in the medium to long term[1]. Ensuring sustainable use of water resources is a widely recognised strategic necessity in Europe and a central goal of the landmark water framework directive adopted by the European Union last year[2]. Reliable water supply and the protection of aquatic resources through adequate water management are essential to support all aspects of human life as well as dependent ecosystems. While use of water varies across Europe because of different climates, cultures, habits, economies and natural conditions, many countries face the common challenge of coping with limited water resources, in terms of both quantity and quality. The report identifies the key aspects and factors of water demand management in the different economic sectors - urban, industrial and agricultural. Based mainly on case studies from around Europe, which are summarised, it analyses the environmental effects of water saving, tariffs, metering, leakage reduction, substitution of water in industrial processes and reuse of treated waste water for irrigation purposes. Irrigation for agriculture has seen a marked increase in southern Europe over the past 15 years. The importance of the direct reuse of waste water for irrigation is increasing in Mediterranean countries but the report finds that standards and guidelines are urgently required. There is also a need for economic incentives to establish new programmes for uses of water that do not require high water quality. The report is intended both as a source of comparative data to support the assessment of policies in place and a source of information for the development of new policies. Besides being a comprehensive survey of European water demand management in its own right, the report also represents a timely contribution to the forthcoming comprehensive stakeholder discussion on urban water management that EU Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstr\u00f6m announced on 19 March.

Data for the years up to 1997 indicate that the EU countries have made little progress towards preventing economic growth from translating into higher natural resources use. This is despite a recognition by world leaders that more efficient use of resources is one of the changes needed to make economies more environmentally sustainable1. Produced for the EEA by Germany's Wuppertal Institute2, the report uses a recently-developed indicator known as Total Material Requirement (TMR) to calculate the EU's overall burden on the world environment. The study3 is an important contribution to the EEA's work on developing leading indicators to monitor and benchmark the EU's progress towards more environmentally sustainable development. TMR measures the mass turnover of all domestic and imported primary materials, except for air and water, that are extracted from nature to support human activities, including all resources required for industrial production, transport, energy and food supply. It indicates the extent of environmental impacts associated with resource extraction, materials and energy use, and generation of emissions and waste. EU countries' predominant material requirements are fossil fuels, metals and minerals. Extraction of biomass - raw materials from plants and crops - and erosion of agricultural soil are also significant factors in the EU's resource demands. The study shows that the EU's material requirements have increased almost as fast as the economy has expanded. Between 1995 and 1997, the most recent year for which calculations have been made, TMR rose by 3% from 18.1 billion tonnes to 18.7 billion. The increase was due entirely to increased materials imports, particularly of precious metal ores, whose extraction creates large volumes of mining waste. TMR grew by the same percentage on a per-capita basis. Consequently, in 1997 around 50 tonnes of materials were extracted from the Earth to support the lifestyle of each of the EU's 373 million citizens. This compares with a TMR of 45 tonnes per head in 1988, when the EU counted 12 members and a lower population of 323 million. The report shows that the EU has made only limited progress towards improving the efficiency of its resource use - its so-called \"material productivity.\" An 11% increase in per-capita TMR between 1988 and 1997 was smaller than the per-capita economic expansion4 of 18% recorded over the same period. However, this does not represent a significant decoupling of TMR from economic growth, the report says. The EU's per-capita TMR is considerably lower than that of the United States, which stood at 84 tonnes in 1994, but above Japan's level of 45 tonnes per head in the same year. It should be noted, however, that both the US and Japan have considerably higher per-capita GDP than the EU. This means that Japan's material productivity is some 1.5 times higher than the EU level.

In addition to the EEA\u0092s pluri-annual reports on the state of and outlook for Europe\u0092s environment, this would be done through annual reporting or periodic updates in the form of environmental indicators, thematic assessments, assessments of sectorial integration and headline indicators. Supporting policy, in particular development of the specific Thematic Plans announced in the 6EAP. The EEA could help lay the groundwork for these with thematic state-of-the-environment assessments. It could also contribute to their implementation through its support for moves to streamline the EU reporting process. Dissemination of information, including best practice. Regarding support for the Swedish presidency of the Council, the Executive Director cited the following initiatives: Input on biodiversity to the Kiruna informal Council of environment ministers Drafting the 2001 TERM report on integration of transport and environment Development of draft indicators on energy and environment Assessment of progress with integration into other sectors using available indicators, and development of common criteria and indicators for assessing integration in all sectors EEA co-organisation of or participation in various presidency seminars, conferences etc. In response, the European Commission representative, David Grant Lawrence, stated that the Commission saw a clear role for the Agency in monitoring the 6EAP. The Executive Director also provided an update on how the EEA is following up on the conclusions of an evaluation of the first five years\u0092 operation of the Agency and the EIONET. He said internal discussions on a revised EEA strategy and new internal organization were advancing well and should be concluded by end-April. A report on these will be made to the next Management Board meeting on 10 July. Preparation for enlargement of the Agency\u0092s membership and budget As of the end of February four of the applicant countries - Bulgaria, Slovakia, Malta and Cyprus - had ratified agreements to become EEA members. The chairman of the Board also announced that the Commission\u0092s Directorate-General for External Relations had given its approval for EEA membership negotiations to start with Switzerland. The Management Board approved revised Rules of Procedure which, among other things, strengthen the executive powers of the Bureau in view of the forthcoming enlargement of the Agency\u0092s membership to 31 countries. The Board also agreed to open membership of the EEA\u0092s Scientific Committee to experts from new member countries but to increase the number of committee members to no more than 20, from 16 now, in order to keep the committee\u0092s size manageable. Also on the agenda was an addendum to the Agency\u0092s work programme for 2001 to prepare Board decisions on further activities to be funded from additional membership fees once new member countries join. The additional budget from these membership fees is estimated for this year at between EUR 3 million and 5.78 million. Board members were invited to submit written comments on the addendum. The addendum and a revised 2001 budget will be tabled for approval at the July Board meeting, by which time it is hoped that some applicant countries will already be EEA members. Turning to next year, the Board approved a draft estimate of the 2002 budget which assumes EUR 21.0 million in core funding from the Commission, an increase of EUR 2.0 million over this year\u0092s initial level. The Agency is seeking this rise to extend its work on sustainable development and strengthen its information activities related to the Mediterranean. Both are key policy priorities for the Commission. The staff funded by the core subvention in 2002 would remain unchanged from this year\u0092s authorized total of 83. However, it is proposed that other contributions and income should fund a further 23 staff, compared with six this year. Election of vice-chairman of the Board Steen Gade, Director General of the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, was elected a vice-chairman of the Management Board. He replaces Markku Nurmi, Director General of the Finnish Ministry of the Environment, who has been a vice-chairman since the Management Board\u0092s inception in 1994, serving two consecutive three-year terms. The Board warmly thanked Mr Nurmi for his long service and dedication. For further details, please see the separate press release. Preparations for appointment of next Executive Director In view of the Executive Director\u0092s planned departure from the Agency in June 2002, the Commission representative circulated a preliminary first draft of the profile that candidates to succeed him would be required to match. He said the Commission\u0092s legal service was examining whether non-EU nationals were eligible to apply. The Commission intends to publish a call for applications before the summer break. The Commission is responsible for managing the selection process and proposing a shortlist of candidates who could be offered the post, while the Management Board makes the final appointment Preparation of Management Board seminar The Board confirmed plans to hold a seminar for Board members at the end of November. It was agreed that this should focus on how to maximize the value of the EIONET and the use made of it. A detailed proposal will be put to the Board in July. European Parliament questions The Commission representative reported on two questions put to the Commission by Spanish Members of the European Parliament following the publication on the EEA\u0092s web site of the Executive Director\u0092s opinion on the Spanish national hydrological plan. These questioned whether this publication and such use of the web site were compatible with the function of Executive Director. In its response to the Parliament the Commission stressed that as the Agency has legal autonomy the Director is accountable for his activities to the EEA\u0092s Management Board on the one hand, and on the other hand that it was clearly stated that the opinion expressed was personal. The Commission representative stated that the Commission saw no breach of any rules but suggested that the Management Board ensure that clear guidelines are drawn up on use of the web site for the future. The Executive Director pointed out that the opinion, which is no longer posted on the EEA web site, had been prepared at the written request of the Spanish government. He proposed to present rules applying to the use of the web site to the next meeting of the Board, and the Board agreed to this.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/Ann985593768"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_0972", "date": "2001-03-22", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Steen Gade elected vice-chairman of EEA Management Board", "text": "NEWS RELEASE Copenhagen, 22 March 2001 Steen Gade elected vice-chairman of EEA Management Board Steen Gade, Director General of the Danish Environmental Protection Agency (Milj\u00f8styrelsen), has been elected a vice-chairman of the Management Board of the European Environment Agency (EEA).

The EEA's Management Board decided at its meeting on 20 March to designate a consortium headed by UAB, a renowned centre of excellence in ecological sciences, as leader of the Agency's new European Topic Centre on terrestrial environment. European Topic Centres are consortia of institutes or organisations with particular expertise that operate as extensions of the EEA by undertaking work in specific areas on a contractual basis. The decision completes the designation of the lead organisations of the five new Topic Centres that will support the EEA's work over the next three years. The Management Board also ratified contracts with the lead organisations of the four other new Topic Centres, which will cover water, air and climate change, nature and biodiversity, and waste and material flows.1 \"The systematic abuse of Europe's land, soil and natural resources is becoming ever more apparent and is likely to worsen unless resolute action is taken to reverse it. This decision will allow the Agency to strengthen its work in this field and help create a more solid basis for policy responses,\" commented Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n, the EEA's Executive Director. The EEA and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) joined forces in a recent report2 to warn that the degradation of Europe's land resources would continue and even accelerate in the absence of prompt action. Land use is one of the six priority themes of the EU strategy on sustainable development that the European Commission will shortly unveil. The appointment of UAB follows a competitive tendering procedure in which two other consortia also presented proposals. The three bids were evaluated by a seven-member committee comprising representatives of the EEA, the EEA's Scientific Committee, the European Commission's Directorate-General for Environment, the EU's Joint Research Centre and Eurostat, the Commission's statistics office. Two further members of the Scientific Committee provided input to the selection process. The evaluation committee concluded that the UAB consortium's proposal was the strongest of the three. The committee's recommendation that the UAB consortium should be designated to lead the Topic Centre was approved by a more than two-thirds majority of the EEA's Management Board. The representatives of Austria, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg voted against the decision. The UAB consortium will be required to improve aspects of its programme concerning soil, contaminated land and data management before starting. UAB will work with seven partner organisations from the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Hungary, Romania and Spain.3 The inclusion of organisations from three central and eastern European countries represents a further step towards integrating these states into the EEA's work programme as they become members of the Agency. The Topic Centre will focus on the issues of land cover and use, soils and coastal zones. It will pay particular attention to the most fragile ecosystems, which include coastal zones and mountain areas. One of the new Topic Centre's first tasks will be to assure quality control of a 10 million EUR project to update detailed satellite photographs of Europe's land cover and then to build on these in its work. The terrestrial environment Topic Centre will innovate by developing an approach to monitoring and assessing the environment based on ecological regions instead of national or administrative boundaries. This will allow the EEA to link environmental information to specific geographical regions or units, such as river basins, mountain ecosystems or urban areas. In the longer term this approach will enable the Agency to develop a Geographic Information System for conducting fully integrated assessments in which environmental parameters such as air emissions, water quality, soil erosion and biodiversity will be shown and interpreted in their geographical context. The Topic Centre on terrestrial environment will be responsible for providing guidance on this spatially-driven approach to the four other Topic Centres. The number of Topic Centres is being reduced from a total of nine in the past, a change that should facilitate a more integrated approach to their issues. The new Topic Centres are due to start work this spring.

Urgent action needed to protect Europe's damaged soils Bonn, 19 December 2000 -- The degradation of Europe's vital soil resources will continue and even accelerate unless prompt action is taken now, according to a new report by the European Environment Agency and the United Nations Environment Programme. \"The sustainable use of soils is one of Europe's greatest environmental, social and economic challenges,\" said Klaus T\u00f6pfer, UNEP's Executive Director. \"Although often overlooked, soil is a natural resource that is no less important to human well-being and the environment than clean water and clean air.\" The report, \"Down to earth: Soil degradation and sustainable development in Europe: A challenge for the XXI century,\" is being released here today on the margins of the annual meeting of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. The 32-page report outlines and quantifies the threats to Europe's soils and proposes solutions. \"Soil degradation is part of the systematic abuse of the European space, its territory and the natural resources involved,\" said Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n, the European Environment Agency's Executive Director. \"This may become, in particular in the EU area, a main challenge for sustainability and would require a common approach.\" Soil provides a large number of different services which we depend on and which we often are unaware of until it is too late. Soils are being over-stressed by Europe's dense settlement patterns and intensive economic activities and by acidification, erosion, contamination, and changes in climate. Growing demand for food production, living space, leisure and tourism facilities, infrastructure and industrial production will only increase the pressure. In some parts of Europe, the degradation is so severe that it has reduced the soil's capacity to support human communities and ecosystems and resulted in desertification. Because it can take hundreds or thousands of years to regenerate most soils, the damage occurring today is for all purposes irreversible. And soil degradation is not only occurring in the Mediterranean countries (Annex IV of the UN Convention on Desertification). While 1/3 of Europe's soil (EEA 1999) may be affected (with over 150 M ha suffering high erosion risk (EEA 1998)) and deterioration is critical in the Mediterranean countries (e.g. Spain: 18% of land affected; loss of 28 t/ha/y peak average for 90-95 in agricultural land) and around the Black Sea (e.g. Ukraine 41% of agricultural land affected by erosion risk in 1996), it also seriously affects Central Europe (Germany was losing due to sealing 120 ha/day in 1997, Austria's agricultural land lost reached 9 t/ha/y (EEA 1999)) and countries like Ireland and Iceland; and it is expected that water erosion risks will increase by 2050 in 80% of EU's agricultural land.

The EEA, through work by its European Topic Centre on Air Emissions, has compiled the official European Community Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-1998 in a report and database, both available on this web site. The report is mainly based on data from the individual Member States, submitted to the European Commission under the EU greenhouse gas Monitoring Mechanism. The methodologies applied are those agreed upon by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The European Commission submitted the inventory to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in accordance with the 15 April 2000 deadline. Carbon dioxide (CO2) makes the largest contribution to EU greenhouse gas emissions (81%), while methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (total of 19%) are other important greenhouse gases. In addition industrial fluorocarbon gases contribute approximately 1% to the total greenhouse gas emissions. Total EU greenhouse gas emissions have fallen slightly (2%) from 1990 to 1998. To achieve the UNFCCC Kyoto Protocol target of 8 % reduction by 2008-2012 (from 1990 levels) for the EU, further reductions of emissions, through additional policies and measures, will be necessary. The reduction is mainly due to a decrease in two Member States (Germany, United Kingdom), while in most Member States emissions have increased since 1990. Total EU CO2 emissions decreased initially in the early 1990s, but started to increase again, and are now on the same level as in 1990. The energy sector (power and heat generation) is the main contributor to EU emissions (32%), followed by transport (24%) and industry (18%). Substantial decreases occurred only in Germany, mainly due to increased energy efficiency and economic restructuring in former East Germany, and in the UK, mainly due to a switch from coal to natural gas. Total EU methane emissions fell by 16% from 1990 to 1998 for similar reasons as mentioned above for CO2 and account for most of the decrease of the total EU greenhouse gas emissions. Nitrous oxide emissions were reduced by 10%, mainly due to reduction measures in industry.

New report highlights environmental threats of present transport trends. Urgent concerns about the expansion and growth of the EU's transport infrastructure are expressed in a new report published by the European Environment Agency. Much of the gain achieved through regulating vehicle and fuel standards is being outweighed by increasing transport volumes and heavier and more powerful vehicles, says the report. It is the first output of the the Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism (TERM), set up by the Commission and the EEA at the suggestion of the joint Transport and Environment Council to gauge progress of integration policies in the transport sector. The first TERM report (\"Are we moving in the right Direction? Indicators on transport and environment integration in the EU\") says transport has become one of the major contributors to several important environment impacts: climate change, acidification, local air pollution, loss in biodiversity and noise. CO2 emissions in the EU have increased by 40% since 1985 as a result of traffic growth (in particular of road and air traffic), the use of heavier and more powerful cars, and the linked growth in energy consumption. Emissions are expected to increase by a further 30% by 2010. Environmental regulations have since the early 1990s led to a decrease in emissions of NOx and NMVOCs, but additional efforts are still needed to meet the EU emission reduction targets. While individual cars and lorries are as much as 90% less noisy than in the 1970s, noise remains a problem because of the doubling of traffic volumes in that same period. More than 30% of the EU's population is subjected to high road traffic noise, about 10% to high rail noise and about the same proportion to noise from air traffic. Only 48% of the petrol-driven cars in the EU are fitted with a catalytic converter. A major success story is the phase-out of leaded petrol, which is expected to be completed by 2005, it says. An average of 10 hectares of land per day are taken for new motorways, which have grown by more than 50% since 1970 while, at the same time, the length of conventional railway lines and inland waterways has decreased by 8%. Transport infrastructure now covers 1.2% of the total EU land area. The number of road fatalities -- 44,000 throughout the EU in 1996 -- has been falling since the 1970s, but the rate of improvement has slowed in the past few years, again due to the growth in passenger transport volumes, with the EU car fleet increasing by 150% since 1970, bringing car ownership to 454 per 1,000 people. Increased policy impetus is needed to reduce the link between transport demand and economic growth and to shift the balance towards less environment-damaging transport modes. This requires more preventative actions to be taken by the sectoral (transport and planning) ministries. If policies are to integrate environmental and other sustainability concerns into transport decision-making, key indicators must be identified so that the success and failure of these policies can be measured. TERM sets out 31 indicators to answer seven basic questions in an attempt to monitor progress and highlight changes in key leverage points for policy intervention. The report calls for improvements in the compiling and reporting of data in order to achieve a better understanding of the causal links between the driving forces of transport demand, how these exert pressures and impact on the environment and people, and the effectiveness of policy responses to remedy these pressures and impacts. The setting of quantifiable intermediate and long-term transport and environmental targets is another prerequisite. A statistical compendium compiled by Eurostat supplements the EEA report and gives additional background data.

It is the European Community\u0092s contribution to the global Clearing House Mechanism being developed under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The EC CHM aims at facilitating scientific and technical co-operation and at providing access to information relevant to the implementation of the CBD by the European Community. It should also contribute to education programmes and to raising public awareness of biodiversity. Access to the EC CHM is possible from both the Europa website of the European Commission (http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/biodiversity/index_en.htm) and from that of the European Environment Agency (http://biodiversity-chm.eea.eu.int). Why an EC CHM? The European Community is committed to facilitate public access to information relevant for biodiversity. The EC CHM is a one-stop-shop for such information. For example, it provides access to information on policies, legislation, funding opportunities, data bases, sources of expertise, etc held by European Community institutions. It provides links to other institutions and organisations (governmental, private and NGOs) keeping useful information elsewhere in Europe. It also links to web sites of global organisations such as the CBD Secretariat web site. The EC CHM is therefore a key tool for anyone who wants to know more about biodiversity. Thanks to the data and information available, the EC CHM is an important tool for promoting and facilitating scientific and technological co-operation not only within Europe but also with countries around the world, in particular with developing countries. How does it work? The EC CHM is the entry point to a huge network of institutions and organisations working directly on biodiversity or whose work is relevant to biodiversity. It provides tools (search facilities) to find information from different perspectives to meet the needs of different potential users. The EC CHM allows you to find out what information is available and to access it. Data and information available through the EC CHM is however kept and maintained by the original sources of information. How is the EC CHM being developed? The European Commission requested the European Environment Agency (EEA) to develop and maintain the EC CHM. The pilot phase of the mechanism is being funded by the European Commission\u0092s IDA-II programme (interchange of data between administrations). Both a Steering Committee and a Task Force guide the development of the EC CHM. They include representatives from EU Member States, the CBD Secretariat, UNEP-ROE and the Council of Europe. Representatives from other countries and, in particular, developing countries have also been involved in the development of the EC CHM. The development of the EC CHM is based on the global guidelines set by the CBD Secretariat and uses the facilities of the EEA website and its standardised document handling. The additional information technology being developed for the website is using generic tools as much as possible. The technical solutions will be made available to other users after the pilot phase is completed.

According to Mr Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n, indicator reports like this one will greatly facilitate benchmarking of progress with the integration of environmental concerns into all EU policy areas. Following the European Council meeting in Cardiff in 1998, this integration process has been given increased attention by the EU. -- Furthermore, Mr Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n added, \"Environmental Signals 2000\" and forthcoming reports will enable us to benchmark overall environmental progress in all member countries. Environmental Signals 2000 is the first of a series of regular indicator reports on the European environment to come from the Agency. Published annually and with policy-makers as the primary target group, these reports will also provide experts and the general public with the very latest assessments of the EU's environment. The reports will fill the five-year gaps between the EEA's main state of the environment reports such as Environment in the European Union at the turn of the century published last year (the next is due in 2003/2004). Environmental Signals 2000 uses dozens of indicators to assess progress (or lack of it) in a number of different areas and sectors. Some of the report's findings: Air pollution: There has been a decline in emissions of general air pollutants, and less of the EU is subject to harmful amounts of acid rain. Even so, the ultimate goal of avoiding all harmful effects on health, vegetation, water and soil has still to be achieved. Many people living in towns and cities in EEA member countries are exposed to higher concentrations of ground level ozone and fine particulate matter than the proposed EC limit values. European emission reduction targets for nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds are unlikely to be met. Climate change: Total greenhouse gas emissions have increased since 1990 in most EEA member countries and are projected to increase in the EU by 6% between 1990 and 2010. In order to reach the Kyoto protocol target, emissions will have to be reduced by more than 10% in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Agriculture: Despite greater awareness of the harm pesticides cause to the environment and human health, dependence on pesticides has not diminished. Overall, eco-efficiency in agriculture has improved only slightly since 1990. Waste: Overall quantities are still increasing, but de-linking of waste production from economic activity has been achieved for municipal waste in Germany, the Netherlands and Iceland. Although recycling initiatives are on the increase, a large proportion of biodegradable waste is still disposed of in landfills. Energy use: The 34% increase in GDP in the EEA member countries over the 1985-97 period outstripped the 1,4% annual improvement in energy efficiency. The end result was a13% overall increase in energy supply over the period. Supply continues to depend on fuels with significant environmental impacts. Energy taxes have not compensated for the underlying fall in energy prices. Transport: Environmental gains from technology improvements have been offset by the rapid growth in transport volumes, especially for road transport and aviation. Road transport efficiency, i.e. the energy used per ton or person kilometre, has not improved over the last 30 years. Demand management policies are needed to de-link transport growth from economic growth, improve transport efficiency and to improve the balance between various modes of transport. The EU's total mass of primary materials extracted from nature to support human activities, an indicator called Total Material Requirement, or TMR, amounts to 18.1 billion tonnes. This equals 49 tonnes per capita, which is significantly lower than the US figure of 84 tonnes but slightly higher than Japan's 45 tonnes per capita. This is the first time the EU's TMR has been calculated. The indicator is a highly aggregated measure for the material basis of an economy, giving a figure for all resource extraction besides water and air. Almost 40% of the TMR in the EU consists of material flows that also involve countries outside of the Union. Looking overall at the integration of environmental concerns into key economic sectors, the indicators used in Environmental Signals 2000 point to movements away from targets in the transport and energy sectors. In both sectors, price incentives run counter to the targets. In agriculture, the indicators suggest continued intensification but also an increase in agro-environmental management, albeit in limited areas. ------------------------------------------ Further information: Project Manager Peter Bosch, +45 33 36 71 07, peter.bosch@eea.europa.eu NB: The report is being sent separately to all journalists on the EEA mailing list from the EU publications office in Luxembourg.

For many environmental problems, ranging from getting rid of oil platforms to climate change, facts are uncertain, values are disputed, stakes are high and decisions urgent. \"Stakeholder involvement\" is the key activity proposed by the authors* of Information tools for environmental policy under conditions of complexity to deal with these problems. They maintain that experts cannot arrive at environmental solutions by dealing with them in a traditional problem-solving manner, due to the complexity of these problems (the word \u2018complex' is used in its scientific meaning). The environment is a site of conflict between competing perspectives, values and interests, and the different groups and communities that represent them. A facilitator attempting to broker an agreement between these disparate interests should understand that diversity and possible conflict are not an unfortunate accident which could be eliminated by better natural or social science, but rather are inherent to the character of the complex system. There is a widespread belief in the academic/scientific community that environmental problems can be solved only by the accredited expertise. However, this approach ignores the fact that, contrary to the impression conveyed by textbooks, most problems in practice have more than one plausible answer, and many have no answer at all. The authors of this Expert Corner report say even the methods used to measure the effects of policies on the environment are imprecise. Advocating that a \"post-normal science\" approach be adopted, the authors introduce a number of alternative approaches to framing and solving problems. Common to these is a diversity of aspects and indicators, the use of multiple criteria and stakeholder involvement. As sustainability is not a purely physical property of simple technological systems, work is now needed to bring into practise the perspectives of this report.

State and pressures of the marine and coastal Mediterranean environment, prepared by the EEA and its European Topic Centre on the Marine and Coastal Environment (ETC/MCE) in co-operation with the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP), presents an overview of the Mediterranean marine and coastal environment. It says the open waters of the sea are generally in good condition and most of the diverse ecosystems appear to be healthy. The sea is characterised by a high diversity of marine species and is recognised as one of the richest biotopes in the world with about 8-9% of the global seas species richness. However, the presence of so many people along the coastal zones of the sea -- either as tourists or inhabitants -- puts continuous pressure on the region, so that only a small percentage of the coastal area is in good condition, with an even smaller part adequately protected. Population increases in the countries bordering the sea, from 450 million people in 1997 to a projected 520-570 million in 2030, as well as tourism growth from 135 million visits in 1990 to as many as 235-350 million in 2025, will create strong competition for space, territory and resources between mankind and nature. On the present evidence, nature will not be the winner. About 60% of urban waste disposed in the Mediterranean Sea is still untreated, the report says. Waters in the open sea are classified among the poorest in nutrients of the world's bodies of water. In coastal areas, the presence of pollution \"hot spots\", located generally in semi-enclosed gulfs and bays near important harbours, big cities and industrial areas, is probably the major problem of the sea. The favourable climatic conditions which lure one-third of global tourism to the Mediterranean coast also provide conditions for relatively long and frequent bathing exposure and beach overcrowding, and thus the area is potentially more conducive to disease transmission and contraction than more temperate regions, such as northern Europe. Scarce and unavailable information about various aspects of the Mediterranean are hampering any cohesive approach to understanding and then solving problems, says the document. In some cases, the information exists in reports that are considered confidential or are accessible only through long and hard administrative procedures. Stronger international co-operation under the Barcelona Convention and through the European Communities is needed, it says, if any headway is to be made in ensuring the viable future of this important sea.

Germany and Italy have introduced CO2 taxes in the framework of ecological tax reform, and France and the UK are implementing CO2 taxes in 2001. Also, an extension of environmental tax bases is taking place in most Member States. As a result, the majority of EU Member States will apply CO2 taxes and have introduced some form of ecological tax reform by 2001. In the report, Environmental taxes \u2014 Recent developments in tools for integration and sustainable development, the Agency says that EU countries are making increasing use of \u2018green' taxes, a practice that even began to accelerate at the end of the 1990s. However, it also notes that very little progress has been made at EU level in adopting environmental taxes over the past decade, mainly due to the obstacle of unanimity voting on fiscal matters. It expects the unanimity requirement to become an even greater obstacle to fiscal harmonisation after EU enlargement. Therefore, the idea of an \"Eco-Schengen\u201d, where some of the EU member countries decide to move ahead together, is gaining attention. Evidence of the effectiveness of environmental taxes is set out in the report, which cites evaluations made by Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK as to the positive results achieved. Well-known success stories \u2014 the water pollution taxes (e.g. in France, German, the Netherlands), the Swedish NOx charge and the tax differentiation between leaded and unleaded petrol \u2014 are supplemented by more recent positive evaluations carried out on the Danish waste tax, the Danish, Finnish and Swedish CO2 taxes, the UK fuel duty \u2018escalator', and the Danish tax on sulphur in fuels. Although 75% of environmental tax revenue comes from energy products, the short-term impact of energy taxes on energy use is usually limited, the Agency says. On transport, while environmental taxes may influence car ownership, car use does not appear to be affected. Plotting the increase in the number of environmental taxes, it says the broadening of the tax base reflects a widening of the \u2018polluter pays' principle to the more comprehensive \u2018user pays' principle. It also points to the Accession Countries' experiences and plans as a valuable source of information and ideas for the present EU, and vice versa. Using data from Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Community, the report finds that the environmental tax share of total tax revenue in the EU is rising slowly but surely through time, from 5.84% in 1980 to 6.17% in 1990 and 6.71% in 1997. A very high proportion (95%) of this revenue comes from just two sectors \u2014 energy and transport \u2014 with less than 5% coming from taxes on emissions, chemical substances, products, waste and natural resources. But although the pollution/resources tax share is modest, it is showing the fastest growth, increasing by 50% in the 1990-97 period. The widespread reluctance to expand the application of environmental taxes is often due to concern about the possible negative effects on competitiveness, employment, inflation or income distribution, says the report, suggesting that the careful design, introduction and implementation of these taxes can overcome such barriers. In particular, modification of the EU rules on state aid could help \u2014 for example, by facilitating tax exemptions for firms that take action beyond what is required by environmental law.

The authors of Nutrients in European Ecosystems say natural lakes, artificial reservoirs, rivers, coastal marine waters and terrestrial ecosystems are all affected to varying degrees of severity by nutrient excesses. In most cases, the damage varies only by geographic region. Many reservoirs serving essential uses such as public water supplies and irrigation are among the most affected by eutrophication because they are, of necessity, located close to areas of intense human activity. The report says eutrophication is a major issue in still water environments but, even after decades of scientific research, there are very few monitoring programmes in existence. In rivers, the most widespread pollutant in geographic terms is phosphorus, which results in the development of large quantities of seasonal plant growth, leading to other types of impact such as perturbed oxygen and pH cycles, organic pollution and massive growth of toxic algae. The report also confirms that excess ammonium is present in many rivers. Excessive levels of nitrates, observed in many previous studies, represent a widespread degradation of river water and, locally, nitrate concentrations may prevent human uses of water. In coastal marine waters, the frequency and geographic extent of eutrophication phenomena are increasing, even in marine areas previously believed to be unaffected. In terrestrial ecosystems, nutrient impacts appear to be serious because of the uncertainty of recovery of the land-based systems, leading to losses of species and ecosystems. The application of nutrient reduction policies is patchy, says the report. But the authors found it difficult to assess the effectiveness of these policies because of the general scarcity of data concerning primary causes, emissions and the status of ecosystems. All the necessary datasets are not available at European or national level, and do not even exist at all in some countries. It was only possible to obtain a small fraction of the existing data, and this fraction was insufficient to produce a full assessment.

However, the Agency is quick to point out that changes introduced are far more than just a cosmetic restyling - the primary aim for the EEA's web developers has been to facilitate matters for the users and to make the Agency's huge depository of online environmental information more easily accessible. Says EEA executive Director Mr. Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n: \"After four years of successful presence on the Internet, it is with pleasure that we may now present a completely renewed and restyled website. With this reinforced Internet presence, we combine and build further on our achievements while extending the services in several areas\". In the age of information overload, the EEA faces a tough challenge when trying to fulfil its mission of bringing order to the complexity of environmental information and target the relevant information to a wide variety of user groups. By organizing the best available environmental information by environmental themes, and introducing powerful multilingual search and retrieval services, the Agency feels confident that it has improved the accessibility of relevant information for its main stakeholders and the European public at large. The bulk of information available on the new site is made up of electronic versions of all EEA publications, including the Agency's main environmental assessment reports. But Mr. Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n also points to new, more dynamic elements that are being introduced: \"We also aim at increasing the transparency of the reporting process by providing overviews of the data underpinning our analysis, and making these data accessible. This is done partly through interactive tools where the user can order graphs and tables to be made on the fly. Furthermore we include an extensive number of links to relevant information from other reliable sources\". The decision to carry out this extensive revamping of its website was taken in response to the extended mandate that that EEA got when its founding Regulation was revised recently. The Agency was here told to further develop a European reference centre for environmental information. According to Sigf\u00fas Bjarnasson, part of the team behind the site \"the Agency's new website is our vehicle, the Internet based tool, to implement this ambition. It is the gateway, the first door of entry, to the information our users need about Europe's environment\". The improvements introduced to the EEA website have been possible thanks to existing partnerships and extensive collaboration with the Agency's \"network of excellence\", the European Environment Information and Observation Network (EIONET). This network comprises more than 500 national organizations, and is coordinated by National Focal Points in the 18 EEA member countries. Nine European Topic Centres on key areas such as air quality, coastal areas and waste are the prime sources of data, information and knowledge that go into the Agency's products - including its website. Mr. Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n underlined the importance of the co-operational aspects when officially launching the new website: \"Only by joining forces will we be able to continue meeting the challenge of maintaining this valuable information pool and broaden the scope of work. He emphasized that what the Agency presented today was not the end station, but merely a stop along the way, though representing a solid basis for further work. \"Our ambition for the time to come is to broaden the multilingual offerings, expand further the linking to additional data sources and continue including more relevant environmental information links\". Finally, the EEA executive director pointed to the need to maintain a dialogue with the end users to help further develop the site, and welcomed comments, suggestion or questions to the EEA Webmaster (webmaster@eea.europa.eu). \"Together with my colleagues I hope you will visit and make use of the website, and help us realize our ambition of being Europe's reference centre - or if you like, the main 'portal' - for environmental information. I am confident that the Agency now has an excellent basis from which to face its main challenge - namely to provide quality information to help improve Europe's environment\". The audience: - A wide spectrum of users looking for green information The EEA's ambition with its website is to be able to cater to the environmental information needs of a diversity of audiences Policy makers, who have a constant need to keep updated on findings and events, and should be able to rely on the Agency to provide them with the factual and scientific foundation needed to convincingly \"make the case\" Journalists who of course will be able to generate news items on the basis of recent additions, but for whom the website is perhaps most useful as a source of background information or a basis for in-depth feature articles The \"doers\", i.e. environmental managers, professionals and administrations, who will be able to find information that can be directly put to use, such as material on environment management tools, and participate in online discussions. The educational and academic sector, including both schools, universities and research institutes who can make use of the website both as reference library and as teaching material NGOs, and particularly environmental organisations who may find the website a treasure-trove of background material for their work And finally, the general public taking an interest in environmental matters who may access the more popular basic information available.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/launch99.html"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_1000", "date": "1999-09-29", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The European Commission's Joint Research Centre and the European Environment Agency join forces for the benefit of Europe's environment", "text": "NEWS RELEASE Embargoed for 29 September 1999 The European Commission's Joint Research Centre and the European Environment Agency join forces for the benefit of Europe's environment Today, Herbert J. Allgeier, Director General of the JRC, and Domingo Jim\u00e9nez Beltr\u00e1n, Executive Director of the EEA, met in Ispra, Italy, and signed a new memorandum of understanding which covers scientific and technical co-operation between the two organisations on the environment. The EEA provides information of direct use for policy makers and the public, while the JRC, as a service of the European Commission, functions as a centre of scientific and technological reference for the Union. Both Directors emphasised the importance of providing support to policy making through dedicated joint activities related to issues such as climate change, the monitoring of chemicals of concern and their effects on the environment, and the protection and recuperation of Europe's natural resources, space and land. This joining of forces will help improve the links between knowledge and decision making in responding to European and international commitments. As part of the Kyoto agreement, in 1998, the EU committed itself to reducing by 2010 its emission levels to 8% less than levels registered in 1990. Besides enhancing the monitoring capacities, EEA-JRC co-operation will help bring to light and test developments in research and technology to face the increasing challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions including the required changes in production and consumption patterns. In the area of chemicals of concern to the environment, the focus is on building up more appropriate monitoring and assessments of chemical pathways and exposures for humans and the environment. Concerning spatial issues and those related to land, the JRC and the EEA are developing and updating mapping systems to reflect the changes in the uses of land and its main features. This is related in particular to the multifunctionality of soil, ground coverage and forestation, nature and biodiversity, the availability of space and fragmentation. This information is an important basis for ensuring a more rational use of these important environmental and socio-economic assets under great pressure. The JRC and the EEA will work on concrete projects in these and other areas supporting sustainable development and environmental policies. The joint work plan, to be finalised in three months, will include the development of a special dissemination programme for progress in research, technology and outlooks. With JRC's knowledge base contributing to the sound scientific basis for EEA's reporting activities, and with the development of joint products and services making research and technological developments accessible and relevant to policy makers and socio-economic agents, the two organisations aim to improve the reach of information from technical knowledge and monitoring data to policy-relevant information for the benefit of the European Community, the Member States and the international community. This new agreement comes at a particularly significant time with the run up to the Helsinki summit in December. At this summit the European Council of Ministers are expected to discuss steps towards sustainable development and new strategies for the integration of environment into sectorial policies. This ambitious project will require a strong commitment from European organisations, and the new agreement between the JRC and EEA will directly contribute to, and support, this important task. Notes: The European Environment Agency (EEA) was established by the European Union in October 1993 in Copenhagen, with a mandate to provide sound environmental information to those concerned with the framing and implementation of European and national environmental policy. The EEA aims to support sustainable development and to help achieve significant and measurable improvement in Europe's environment, through the provision of timely, targeted, relevant and reliable information to policy-making agents and the public. The EEA is funded by the European Union; its coverage extends beyond the EU15 countries to include Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. A strong co-operation also exists with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The JRC is a service of the European Commission. Its mission is to provide customer-driven scientific and technical support for the conception, development, implementation and monitoring of EU policies. The JRC functions as a centre of science and technology reference for the Union. Close to the policy-making process, it serves the common interest of the Member States, while being independent of special interest, private or national.

The report provides, for the first time, an assessment of the development of environmental quality in the EU in the near future, i.e. 2010. 1 Main findings of the report Despite more than 25 years of Community environmental policy -- successful, on its own terms --, general environmental quality in the European Union (EU) is not recovering significantly. However, there has been real progress in some areas, e.g. river quality and acidification but it is getting worse in others , e.g. waste. Environmental policy can not alone provide the sustainable development set up as a goal in the Amsterdam Treaty. Economic sectors have to change and carry their part of the responsibility for sustainability. The present report analyses that situation and documents the current and future unsustainable development of some economic sectors - transport, energy, agriculture, household consumption and tourism. This is the major barrier to environmental improvement, even when considering policies in place or in the pipeline in 1997. If no additional action is taken, the EU environment will remain under serious pressure from a range of activities -- transport, industrial production , leisure activities and even from individual life style -- many of which are forecast to increase the pressure. Because they are interconnected, they will have a knock-on effect on each other: EU economic growth 2: We have seen some progress in eco-efficiency - less pollution per GDP. But production and consumption will increase more and, in general, demand more natural resources and generate more pollutants and waste. We can expect the increase in waste -- 10% from 1990 to 1996 -- to continue. This development has already started eroding gains from environmental policy initiatives e.g. air quality Directives. Economic growth therefore necessitates speeding up efforts towards better integration of environment into all policy areas. Despite a growth in energy efficiency, EU's energy consumption (1995 - 2010) will increase by 15% from 1995 to 2010. With more households, more mobility and more transport, 30% increase is foreseen in passenger car transport and 50% in freight transport. This causes in particular a rise in emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, making climate change issues even more difficult to tackle. The EU target to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions by 8% between 1990 and 2008 - 2012 will not be met under pre-Kyoto action. Instead a 6% increase of emissions is expected. The share of renewable energy, now 6%, is increasing, though only modestly; it is unlikely that the target of 12% by 2010 will be met. Tourism is growing rapidly and significantly. A 50% increase in international tourist arrivals is expected between 1996 and 2010, causing a rise in transport and energy demand. There is also an on-going increase in urban sprawl, with up to 120 ha/day in land-use changes in some countries. Together this means a serious challenge to rural assets and sensitive areas such as coastal zones, 85% of which are already at high or moderate risk from various pressures. Total chemicals production is on a rising trend while minimal risk-assessment analysis is not carried out for 75% of the large-volume chemicals on the market. Emissions or discharges of some heavy metals, like cadmium and copper, and of hazardous chemicals from industry, road transport and agriculture - like some pesticides - are expected to rise. Other emissions, like lead and dioxins, are forecast to decrease. Progress in the integration of the environment into sectoral decision-making and policies is real but slow. Major progress is seen in industry, using environmental management and audit schemes. Economic instruments such as eco-taxes are still being applied on a small scale. There is great potential for expanding integration policies and instruments into other economic sectors. What has been achieved, in what areas and what is the outlook? Assessment of progress over the past 5-10 years and trends up to 2010 (2050 for Climate Change and Ozone Depleting Substances). The indications about the pressures show how factors are changing, such as emissions of pollutants or land use, which give rise to the problems. The information about state and impacts indicate how these pressures are changing environmental quality. PRESSURES Environmental Issues STATE & IMPACT Present Future \u00a0 Present Future Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change Ozone Depletion Hazardous Substances ? Transboundary Air Pollution Water stress Soil Degradation ? Waste Biodiversity ? Human Health ? Urban areas Coastal and Marine Areas ? Legend: positive development some positive development but insufficient unfavourable development ? uncertain (partial quantitative/expert analysis available) From the above summary table, we can see significant and positive cuts in ozone-depleting substances. There has also been a reduction of emissions contributing to acidification and of phosphorus discharges to rivers. Progress in reducing other pressures on the environment has remained largely insufficient. Only air polluting emissions have shown a significant decoupling from GDP since 1990. By contrast, there has only been a relatively small decoupling of carbon dioxide and waste. The outlook foresees these trends to continue to 2010 with future emissions increasing in problem areas that have appeared difficult to tackle: greenhouse gas emissions, chemicals and waste. In the main economic sectors, polluting emissions have declined significantly in energy, transport and industry sectors, and less so in agriculture. But for transport and agriculture, energy use and carbon dioxide have continued to grow in step with output. There is no indication of significant eco-efficiency gains in these two critical sectors up to 2010. These pressures feed through into an equally troubling story about the state of the environment foreseen in 2010. In particular, impacts from climate change and waste generation are expected to worsen. Positive developments are anticipated for the impacts of transboundary air pollution, where ecosystems with acid deposition levels above their critical loads will fall from 25% in 1990 to 7% in 2010, water quality, where further reduction of phosphorus and organic matter discharges is expected, and air quality in cities, where continued improvement is foreseen. There remain, however, considerable uncertainties. Due either to a lack of data in some areas, such as soil, biodiversity, or pesticides in groundwater, or to uncertainties about future socio-economic developments, it is difficult to clearly evaluate the direction in which we are heading. It is particularly difficult to assess the prospects of important emerging issues, which are also of rising public concern: e.g. human health issues, where particulate air pollutants are involved in perhaps 40000-150 000 extra adult deaths of respiratory diseases in cities/year; the effect of chemicals such as dioxin and GMOs in food. There are, however, small but rapidly-growing positive signals in various countries. Cycling is taking higher percentages of some cities' traffic; pesticide-free areas or municipalities are being declared; a significant growth is seen in organic agriculture; many companies are embracing sustainability as a feasible and profitable process and many municipalities are developing their own local Agenda 21 programmes. Finally, the report documents the challenge and opportunities of the EU Enlargement. Some Accession Countries have more environmentally sustainable economic activities, and also more extensive areas of natural habitats. However, in the transition to EU membership, there is a danger that their environment will suffer if they follow the same development path of the EU15. When convergence with the present EU implies accelerated economic growth in the Accession Countries their challenge is to ensure that they do not repeat the two decades of environmental neglect that occurred in western Europe - which eventually, in the 1970s, prompted a crash programme of remedial action at European and national level. Concerning the findings of the report, EEA's Executive Director Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e0n said: \"The situation of EU's environment and the progress towards sustainability is not satisfactory and it can even deteriorate before we get the conditions right for improvement. However, the situation is changing. First, there are positive, though still small, signs showing that a change is feasible and rewarding: e.g. wind energy. Secondly, the objective conditions for change are building up: the Amsterdam Treaty provisions on sustainability, the Cardiff integration initiative paving the way to the Helsinki Summit. And, finally, opportunities are arising for the EU to move towards sustainability: Kyoto Protocol implementation, Agenda 2000 and the enlargement process. Let's get these right!\" D. Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e0n presented the report to the EU Environment Council on 24 June 1999.

Discussing also the EU enlargement issues, the report also covers 11 Accession countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Cyprus). Finally, EFTA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) are treated where appropriate. The report diagnoses and measures the situation for the most recent years available, and also assesses future trends - thereby evaluating past and likely forward progress against EU and international targets and policy objectives, taking account of expected pressures, including economic and other developments. It aims to provide important information to all those who frame and implement effective environmental policies, and other measures which could affect these policies. 2 The report uses a baseline scenario (based on OECD and European Commission socio-economic business-as-usual scenarios) under which a 45% increase in economic growth is expected between 1990 and 2010 and a projected 50% increase in final consumption between 1995-2010.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/eu98.html"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_1002", "date": "1998-09-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "The European Environment Agency in Copenhagen will co-operate with 17 meteorological institutes all over Europe", "text": "NEWS RELEASE Copenhagen, 3 September 1998 The European Environment Agency in Copenhagen will co-operate with 17 meteorological institutes all over Europe A new agreement between the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the Conference of the European National Meteorological Services (EUMETNET) boosts international environmental co-operation International environmental co-operation has been strengthened with an agreement of co-operation between the European Environment Agency (EEA) in Copenhagen and the Conference of the European National Meteorological Services (EUMETNET). The co-operation will include new methods for predicting future air pollution episodes, continuous monitoring of air quality and climate changes on the European continent, and the exchange of timely information and descriptions of the actual state of the climate in Europe. The members of EUMETNET have selected the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) to be Chair of the EUMETNET's new environment working group (in this capacity DMI in Copenhagen, Denmark, now becomes one of EEA's working partners).

In this way the expertise within these institutes can be utilised in the best interests of the European population as a whole, in particular for reports on environment in the European continent and in the EU such as \"Europe's Environment: The Second Assessment\" presented by the EEA at the \u00c5rhus Conference in June 1998. As a result, EEA assessments of the current and future state of the environment, especially in the areas of climate change, acidification, ground level ozone and air quality, can be further improved. The EEA was set up in 1993 by the EU with the goal to provide objective, reliable and comparable information with respect to significant environmental issues in Europe. This enables EU member countries to move efficiently to protect the environment and to inform the general public of the present state and development of the environment. The EEA provides objective, reliable and comparable information on Europe's environment for those concerned with framing and implementing European and national environmental policy, and for the public. EUMETNET provides the framework for co-operative programmes between 17 European National Meteorological Services covering in area observation and operation within all the EEA Member States (i.e. EU Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The programmes relate to meteorological observing systems, data processing and weather forecasting activities, and provision of service to environment management and climate monitoring. The EUMETNET Working Group for Environment (WG-ENV) was established in 1997 with a mandate from the EUMETNET Council to develop relations with EEA.

Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) published \"Europe's Environment: The Second Assessment\". The report measures progress in Europe's environmental quality compared to the EEA's 1995 assessment. It provides a clear picture of the state of the environment in Europe and the main areas requiring action at national and international level. The main conclusions of the 295-page report are: Europe has made progress in reducing some pressures on the environment from pollution: emissions of sulphur dioxide, lead, ozone-depleting substances, and phosphorus have been substantially reduced, whilst common urban air pollutants nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds have also decreased since 1990. Progress has been greatest in areas covered by international legal instruments, such as the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the UNECE Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution. The absence of such initiatives for soil conservation and waste (other than hazardous waste) partly explains the limited progress and poor data availability in these areas. Progress in emission reductions, however, has not lead to an overall improvement in the quality of Europe's environment. Natural time delays are the reason why ozone depletion is continuing above Europe and eutrophication in lakes is still at the same level as in the beginning of the 1990s. [more detailed findings hereafter]. In many cases the scale of measures to reduce pressures on the environment has been too limited given the size and the complexity of the problems, for instance in dealing with climate change, summer smog, pesticides in groundwater, polluted sites and soil erosion. For nature protection and biodiversity conservation many initiatives have been taken, but implementation in the field has been slow, partly due to lack of resources for ensuring proper management. Measures are now needed to help conserve the unspoiled natural areas in Eastern Europe. The transport and agriculture sectors are key causes of many of Europe's environmental problems, and the environmental pressures caused by these sectors are in some cases growing fast. In addition emissions from agriculture and transport are more difficult to control than those from industry, from which the pressures have been reduced since 1990. Substantial differences are highlighted between the various regions, especially between Western and Eastern Europe, but also between individual countries within a region. The many diagrams included in the report show that in general Western Europe is the biggest contributor to pollution in Europe. This is especially the case since the start of the economic transition in Central and Eastern Europe and the Newly Independent States where the initial economic slow-down resulted in reduced emissions. The report shows that a special effort is needed to ensure that, once economic growth picks up again in Eastern Europe, it does not lead to degradation of nature in the region and deterioration of environmental quality in Europe. \"Europe's Environment: The Second Assessment\" covers the state of the environment in the 44 countries of the European continent and identifies the main socio-economic driving forces that put pressure on Europe's environment. It also points to key areas where further action is needed. The report will be presented to the Conference of European Environment Ministers \u2018Environment for Europe', to be held in Aarhus, Denmark on 23-25 June. With this report the European Environment Agency has made another step towards improving and consolidating its network for environmental monitoring and reporting. To meet the needs of the Environment for Europe process, the Agency is ready to establish a common accounting and reporting process, linked with policy development, for tracking the implementation of the decisions taken in Aarhus and future European summits and conferences. Notes: In 1991, the First Conference of European Environment Ministers held in Dobris Castle, near Prague, called for a comprehensive assessment of Europe's environment and endorsed the \u2018Environmental Programme for Europe' (EPE), which sets out a number of long term environmental priorities at the European level. The report \"Europe's Environment: The Dobris Assessment\", published by the EEA in 1995, provided the requested assessment. The Dobris report was used in the preparation of the Third European Environment Ministers Conference in Sofia (October 1995). The Sofia Conference asked the EEA to produce a further assessment of the relevant changes in European environmental quality and pressures to enable the effects of the implementation of the Environmental Programme for Europe to be followed and evaluated. The report \"Europe's Environment: The Second Assessment\" is the response to this request. It will be presented to the Fourth Pan-European Environment Ministers' Conference, to be held in Aarhus, Denmark from 23-25 June 1998. Twelve key environmental problems identified in the Dobris Assessment are the focus of this second report. These are: Climate change, Stratospheric ozone depletion, Acidification, Tropospheric ozone, Waste, Chemicals, Biodiversity, Inland waters, Marine and coastal environment, Soil degradation, Urban environment and Technological and natural hazards. The report is based on data collected by international organisations, including the UN, OECD, WHO, the European Commission and Eurostat. In addition the European Environment Agency has carried out a further data collection exercise through its network of European Topic Centres. More than 120 individuals all over Europe contributed to the data collection and the writing of the report. Data for some Eastern European countries and for topics such as waste, chemicals, soil degradation and the urban environment is less complete than for other regions and topics. The European Environment Agency is continuing to expand its data collection and analysis activities to provide more comprehensive information on the current and future state of Europe's environment for use by policy-makers and by the general public and to provide more complete assessments of the effectiveness of environmental policies. Its extending networking and reporting capacities now need to include the expertise needed for more complete overviews on chemicals, radio-activity, and the urban environment. Findings issue by issue Atmospheric issues: Strong moves to reduce harmful emissions, with substantial reductions in most European countries - mainly due to emission reduction policies, structural changes in industrial production and shifts to cleaner fuels. In Eastern Europe, emissions have been considerably reduced as a result of a steep drop in industrial production and energy use. Across Europe, emissions of several pollutants need to be further reduced to meet agreed and expected targets of international conventions. Climate change: Since 1990, emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel fell 3% in Western Europe and 19% in Eastern Europe, mainly due to structural changes in industry and a switch to gas as an energy source. However, these factors are unlikely to be sufficient to meet the more demanding targets agreed at Kyoto for 2005 and 2010 and new measures will be needed. There is still considerable technical scope for increasing energy efficiency. Relatively low energy prices in recent years have not provided a sufficient stimulus for energy efficiency improvement. In Eastern Europe, economic convergence with the West could reverse current trend towards lower energy consumption, which might jeopardise the regional contribution to reaching the Kyoto targets. Stratospheric ozone depletion: Annual production of ozone-depleting substances down 80 to 90%. Rapid fall in CFC emissions - but emission of substitutes (HCFCs) increasing. Ozone concentration in stratosphere still unaffected by international measures due to time delays. Above Europe, 5% drop in amount of ozone between 1975 and 1995. Recovery will take many decades - could be accelerated by more rapid phase-out of HCFCs and methyl bromide and careful destruction and/or recycling of CFCs and halons from current appliances. Acidification: Some progress since 1990, with continuing reduction of sulphur dioxide emissions (50% between 1980 to 1995 in Europe as a whole) as a result of policy measures, fuel switching, and economic restructuring. For about 10% of Europe's land area, level of deposition still too high and further emission reductions are needed to achieve a sustainable level. Growth in car numbers and usage are offsetting benefits of technical improvements (exhaust catalysts, cleaner engines). In Eastern Europe growth in private transport likely to exacerbate the problem. NOx emissions: the EC's 5th Action Programme aimed for 30% reduction between 1990 and 2000, but by 1995 only 8% was achieved. Tropospheric ozone/summer smog: 14% reduction in emissions of ozone precursors in Europe between 1990 and 1995 through control measures in various sectors and economic restructuring in Eastern Europe. But threshold concentrations in tropospheric concentrations frequently exceeded in most European countries. In EU, about 700 hospital admissions in March to October 1995 attributed to excessive ozone concentrations. Protection threshold for vegetation exceeded in most EU countries in 1995. Chemicals: The chemical industry in Western Europe continues to grow more rapidly than GDP, and there are several hundred new compounds marketed each year. Eastern European chemical production down markedly since 1989, but partial recovery in some countries. However, the extent of the threat from chemicals to environment/health is unknown. Because toxicity assessment of chemicals is a slow process, attention is shifting to new initiatives for chemicals control based on the precautionary principle. Some new national and international initiatives have been introduced (voluntary reduction, taxation and public access to data), and there is scope for a wider application of these instruments. Waste: Nearly 10% increase since 1990 in reported waste generation from agriculture, mining, manufacturing, municipal and energy. Municipal waste up by 11% in OECD European countries since 1990 (425 kg per person per annum). Waste management still dominated by cheapest option: landfill. Even so, recycling rates for paper and glass have reached 40% and 50% respectively in several western European countries. In Eastern Europe waste management requires better strategic planning and more investment. In all countries waste reduction remains the main challenge. Biodiversity loss: Little overall progress since 1990. Agriculture, forestry, infrastructure development and various forms of pollution are still main sources of stress. Many nature protection initiatives - but actual implementation slow. CEE: unspoiled virgin forests and natural habitats threatened by economic change unless adequately protected by EPE and accession agreements. Wetland loss is greatest in southern Europe; large losses also in agricultural/urbanised areas in north-west and central Europe. Semi-natural agricultural habitats declining rapidly due to intensive agriculture and forestry. Inland waters: Water abstractions stable or even decreased in a number of European countries (west and east), but severe availability/demand imbalances continue to occur locally. No overall improvement in river quality, although some improvements in most seriously polluted rivers since 1970s. Eutrophication is still a problem. Nitrate concentrations in ground water low in northern Europe, high in several western and Eastern countries. Phosphorus emissions into rivers down 40 - 60% in several countries during 1980 - 1995, but at about a quarter of river monitoring sites, phosphorus concentrations are still about ten times higher than in good quality water. Nitrogen emissions to water have not decreased and continue to cause eutrophication problems (algae blooms) in coastal waters. Marine and coastal environment: Most threatened seas: The North Sea, The Mediterranean, The Black Sea, The Baltic. Nutrient concentration in Black Sea, mainly from Danube watershed, increased tenfold between 1960-1992. Many seas are heavily over-fished, particularly The North Sea, The Iberian seas, The Mediterranean, The Black Sea. Contamination of sediments and marine animals with heavy metals and PCBs is common in coastal areas in the whole of Europe. Soil degradation: Over 300,000 potentially contaminated sites identified in Western Europe. Total throughout Europe much greater, and impacts largely unknown. 115 million ha suffers from water erosion, 42 million ha from wind erosion; problem greatest in Mediterranean region. Nearly 4 million ha affected by salinisation, mainly in the Mediterranean region and in the southern Newly Independent States. The risk of desertification has increased in vulnerable areas, particularly in Mediterranean area. Technological/natural hazards: Industrial accidents per unit of activity in EU decreasing (no databases for Eastern Europe). Dramatic world-wide reduction in annual number of large oil spills. Exceptionally large number of floods in 1990s, probably caused by natural variations in water flow, possibly amplified by human activities. No nuclear accidents since 1986 (Chernobyl) but some 'deviations' and a few 'incidents'. Findings sector by sector Key sectoral \"driving forces\" that impact on Europe's environment are transport, energy, industry and agriculture, although other sectors like households and tourism also have considerable influence. Transport: Here, more than in any other sector, environmental policies are failing to keep up with growth (goods transport up 54% since 1980, car passenger transport up 46% since 1985). Efforts are being made to restrain growth in demand for transport, promote public transport and reduce the need for transport by encouraging new patterns of settlement and production. However in all parts of Europe public transport is losing out to private transport and there is a considerable political momentum to extend road and traffic infrastructure. Energy: Consumption remains consistently high in Western Europe since 1990; further improvement in energy efficiency difficult to achieve while fossil fuels remain cheap. In Eastern Europe, energy consumption down 23% since 1990, but expected to increase during economic recovery. These countries are still less energy efficient than Western Europe. However, the large distance to greenhouse gas reduction targets requires attention to improving energy efficiency and increasing the use of renewable sources in the whole of Europe. Industry: Relative contribution of industry to climate change, acidification, tropospheric ozone and water pollution has decreased since 1990. In Western Europe, environmental objectives slowly becoming integrated into industrial decision-making. In Eastern Europe such integration is not common. Agriculture: In Western Europe, yields continue to increase due to advances in agricultural practices. Use of inorganic fertilisers and pesticides seems to have levelled off, water use has continued to increase. Environmental considerations still only a small part of CAP, while GATT and CAP reform may lead to further rationalisation and specialisation of agricultural production. Eastern Europe: modernisation of agriculture remains a priority, but difficult to assess overall impact of this development.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/dobris2.html"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_1004", "date": "1998-03-11", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Environmental Information Strategies at Work: A Joint and Shared View of the U.S. EPA and the EU's EEA", "text": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the European Environment Agency (EEA) are two distinct organizations with similar information concerns: how to manage the plethora of environmental information within their agencies for the benefit of users, decision-makers, institutions, administrations, and businesses, and how to disseminate that information to the public. In our mutual quest to provide reliable information to our user communities, and in the scenario of the Information Society, EPA and EEA look to Information Technology (IT) for solutions that must be demand-driven. We also look to expand the working relationship with each other in areas of common interest and concern to mutually support our mandates and programs. What follows are things we have learned about each other. EPA, established 25 years ago to regulate and monitor activity that affects the environment, relies on information contained in its many databases to achieve its goals. The Agency\u0092s current challenge is to acquire, integrate, and standardize data scattered throughout a multitude of databases across the country and allow public access to these (publicly-owned) data. Conversely, EEA was established by the European Union (EU) in 1993 to \"orchestrate, cross-check and put to strategic use information of relevance to the protection and improvement of Europe\u0092s environment\". As a new agency, it strives to build relationships among member states in the EU and become the source for environmental analysis and information exchange. EEA\u0092s mandate is to furnish the EU and its member states with objective, reliable, and comparable information; its challenge is to collect, manage, and disseminate the information with the support of an extended European Information and Observation Network (EIONET), built up with the member states. EEA has begun to build an efficient information system to meet this challenge and hopes to use some of the strategies implemented by EPA. While EPA is facing the challenges associated with reinventing information strategies, EEA is looking to develop a system to store and disseminate environmental information. Despite innate differences in their functions\u0097EEA is an analytical, rather than a regulatory, agency\u0097the agencies have similar philosophies concerning information management. EPA\u0092s modern data management approach strives to make environmental information available and useful to the public through partnerships and infrastructure improvement. The Agency has shifted from the media-by-media approach to a more comprehensive approach to data management. Initial efforts to make cross-media data accessible have succeeded beyond expectations, as evidenced by usage from the World Wide Web, with millions of hits per month coming from users inside and outside the agency. The initial success has lead to the announcement of a major initiative by Carol Browner, the EPA Administrator. This initiative will extend the coverage and capabilities of the initial efforts and make them the foundation for greatly improved interaction between EPA, its regulated entities, and the public. In 1995, EPA developed the Envirofacts Warehouse, an integrated system that provides access to information contained in seven major Agency databases through on-line queries and mapping applications. The database is accessed internally over EPA\u0092s Intranet as well as over the Internet. Users can access the Envirofacts Warehouse through the EPA Website to obtain a description of the type of information contained in the database. They can also retrieve data through on-line queries. Mapping applications within Envirofacts allow users to identify EPA-regulated facilities and perform limited demographic analysis. Additional databases and applications will be incorporated into the data warehouse to expand its capabilities. The Environmental Data Registry is also accessible through the EPA Website. It is a source of information about data for EPA, a directory for finding the information, and a repository for capturing and disseminating critical information that describes the individual units of environmental data, called data elements. EEA is interested in adapting the data warehouse and data registry concepts to meet its mission goals. EEA\u0092s responsibilities include assessing, analyzing, and monitoring the situation and trends of Europe\u0092s environment, and reporting findings to EU institutions, member states, and the public. This information can be used by the EU and member states as they implement and refine environmental policy. The unique political structure of the EU and the additional burden of making formerly internal information public\u0097 \"Introducing openness where confidentiality was the rule\"\u0097further complicate matters. EEA, like EPA, relies on the World Wide Web to disseminate information. EEA, however, faces the additional challenge of offering information in many languages. Among the projects the agency has undertaken are development of the General European Multilingual Environmental Thesaurus (GEMET), a multi-lingual Information Locator Service, and a Catalogue of Data Sources (CDS). Each will assist in providing information to a multi-lingual user community. EEA also established, and is the nucleus of, EIONET, a network of agencies and institutions working together to monitor environmental conditions in Europe. Like EPA, EEA plans to use an Intranet to communicate within the organization. Before it is fully functional, communication servers must be installed in all the member countries; these servers must be successfully integrated with the internal technology; and management, technical, and support staff must be assigned to administer the system within the various countries. EIONET hopes to fully implement its telematic services by the end of 1998. As our organizations, EPA and EEA, work toward more effective management and dissemination of environmental data, partnerships will become critical. Each organization empowers its employees with Internet connectivity and a significant Website, which allows the agencies to disseminate information within their organization as well as to the public. Both EEA and EPA have used advanced data management to their advantage. Currently, our agencies are forming partnerships to share best practices, knowledge, tools, and environmental information where appropriate. As EPA and EEA pursue strategies to accomplish their missions through use of innovative technology, the agencies will increasingly work together to share best practices and environmental information. Although the agencies have somewhat different goals and functions, EPA and EEA both look toward IT to assist them in creating, storing, managing, and disseminating environmental information in order to achieve the overall goal of an improved environment. Ultimately, a coordinated approach to information management will influence the activities of decision-makers, improve the ability to do comprehensive environmental analysis, and empower the public. A main finding that both our Agencies share is that putting environmental information to work is a necessary foundation for supporting the process of progress towards sustainable development. The extreme importance of the decisions to be made, and the need for effective participation of the public, both require that the best available information (BAI) be accessible to all socio-economic agents and partners. EEA is committed to exposing and sharing BAI, which is also a fundamental tenet of EPA\u0092s public access program, as the best way to improve the quality and comparability of information. We at the EPA and EEA are willing to share our views and information capacities with others, beyond our immediate constituents, to face the common global challenges and turn them into opportunities by means of common information.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/eeaeapdc.html"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_1005", "date": "1997-10-23", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "Improved Access to better and more harmonised Information for Environmental Decision-Making", "text": "PRESS RELEASE Improved Access to better and more harmonised Information for Environmental Decision-Making \u00a0 Memorandum of understanding between European Environment Agency and United Nations Environment Programme creates new possibilities The co-operation between the European Environment Agency (EEA) in Copenhagen and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is being expanded and extended. A new Memorandum of Understanding was signed on Thursday 23 October 1997 between the Executive Director of the European Environment Agency, Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n, and Regional Representative and Director of UNEP\u2019s Regional Office for Europe, Frits Schlingemann. The meeting between the two Directors was held in Copenhagen, Denmark. EEA and UNEP have already been co-operating for some time, in order to develop mutually supportive activities. The new Memorandum of Understanding between the two organisations provides new possibilities for a deeper and closer relationship. The background of the new situation between EEA and UNEP can first of all be found in the fact that the two organisations already have mutually complementary activities, goals and requirements to satisfy, but each has restricted means with which to achieve them. An example from the capacity-building and networking side is the complementarity between UNEP\u2019s ENRIN (Environmental and Natural Resources Information Networking) and EEA\u2019s EIONET (Environment Information and Observation Network). While the EEA\u2019s main focus is on EU and Accession Countries, UNEP has global strengths and thus is able to cover complementary areas around the periphery of Western Europe, in both Central and Eastern Europe and in the Mediterranean Region. Together it is possible to build a wider and stronger network. Many goals There are many goals of this co-operation. In the context of the \"Environment for Europe\" process and in particular, the next major European Ministerial Conference on the Environment to take place in Aarhus, Denmark in June 1998, the EEA\u2019s and UNEP\u2019s mutual activities should improve the efficiency of both organisations and provide an improved information base. For example, the cooperation is facilitating the development of the new progress report on the state of the pan-European environment (Dobris+3) to be ready early in 1998, as a follow-up to the first Dobris Assessment published in 1995, as well as input from this process in the preparation of UNEP\u2019s second Global Environmental Outlook (GEO-2). The groundwork being laid for a joint reporting activity on the Mediterranean area will also benefit from this deeper co-operation. Fundamental to all these activities is the use of existing capacities, the catalysis and mobilisation of additional resources, and the complementarily of both agencies\u2019 networks. A major objective is also to improve access to environmental information, for countries with economies in transition and in the greater Mediterranean region as well as decision-makers civil society and the European public in general. In this context EEA and UNEP will support the strengthening of capacities of countries to manage and exchange information on the environment (especially the technical base needed to support data gathering and dissemination) to produce state of environment reports and assessments. This cooperation will benefit all the European partners of the two organisations. It will also enable EEA and UNEP to work more closely with the European Commission\u2019s PHARE, TACIS and MEDA programmes. Have already made progress \"Our co-operation, however, is not new. Joint ventures have already been carried out including assessment of critical issues\", informs EEA\u2019s Executive Director, Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n. He refers in particular to a joint statement produced on water resources and pollution in the beginning of 1997 and a next statement on chemicals which is under preparation. Both directors agree that drinking water and chemical pollution are a major concern for the population in Europe. It is essential to have as much information as possible about the presence of chemicals such as pesticides in groundwater and in the food chain. \"Doing things together will help us do them better and more efficiently, as we are already doing with the WHO Regional Office here in Copenhagen. This is real \u2018networking\u2019 \", says Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n.

The overall activities of the two Agencies is to develop a co-operation based on mutual supporting activities, sharing experiences and knowledge on issues relevant to the recovery, protection and maintenance of environmental quality within the European Union and in the United States. The main goal is to develop a common approach in the field of environmental information. The EEA is developing a broad information system and make the content available to policy makers as well as to the public. The EPA is reinventing environmental information to create a simple environmental information system in order to facilitate and ease public access. This exchange of experiences is providing possibilities for an improved level of information by exposing it and also to improve implementation of legislation by making it public. One of the goals is to increase the value of the environmental information exposed to the public. Another thing is to get more knowledge about how to provide quality information for both internal and public decision-making at the same time. Developing of common frameworks for environmental information and structured knowledge can assure flow and access, and also improve decision making in environmental policy. The co-operation between the two Agencies also gives the possibility for developing a common or shared technical tool to support global information and to profit from a set up of a multi language thesaurus on environmental technical terms. The co-operation takes place under the auspices of the New Transatlantic Agenda (NTA) signed in Madrid on 3 December, 1995, between US President Bill Clinton and the Acting President of the European Union (EU) Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, providing co-operation to respond to Global Changes. The ongoing technical contacts have since the middle of 1996 grown in scope, culminating in a joint EEA-EPA technical and project exchange conference in Washington, D.C. in December 1996. The two Agencies intend to improve the effectiveness of multilateral efforts to protect the environment by strengthening the exchange of information, by reporting on key global environmental issues, by co-ordinating initiatives and by institutionalising regular bilateral consultations to discuss progress, identify actions, and optimise the use of information to fulfil their mandates and visions. One of the projects they are sharing is to create an information locator service and a virtual environmental library on the Internet. The EEA is actively co-operating with the Centre of Earth Observation on this project, and both EEA and EPA will work together as information providers to this information service, once it is established in late 1997. Transfer of experience concerning the Envirofacts Data Warehouse (EF) is another joint project of EPA. This is a database of nearly 800,000 facilities in the U.S. regulated by one or more of the national environmental statutes and contains an Internet based mapping capability for spatial display of results. That is of significant interest to survey all activities that have an environmental impact and provide improvements by making information publicly available. The EEA will study EF in detail and the possibilities to implement a system with similar functionality but based on the distributed architecture of its own Environmental Information and Observation Network (EIONET). Member countries of the EEA will be consulted and the databases provided can be incorporated into the system. The implementation of the Emmissions Inventory foreseen in the Integrated Pollution Prevention Control (IPPC) directory could signify a big support to this development. As EPA has a long tradition in providing public web services, and the EEA has launched a very successful website in November 1995 two Agencies will take advantage of this knowledge and investigate the possibilities of creating an environmental information channel on Internet with push technology. \"We look forward to activate this very effective and low cost co-operation to the benefit of all the users of the information, provided by EEA and EPA. It means, that also countries outside the EU and USA can profit from this joint experience\", says Executive Director Domingo Jimen\u00e9z-Beltr\u00e1n, The European Environment Agency in Copenhagen, Denmark.

July 1997 Are Environmental Agreements effective? The report \"Environmental Agreements, Environmental Effectiveness\", published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) today, was first released at the meeting of the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on the 21st May 1997. The report focuses on the assessment of the environmental effectiveness of a selection of environmental agreements(1), and includes a review of the use of environmental agreements in Europe as well as an overview of the on-going debate on the subject. The EEA mission statement includes the \u2018provision of timely and targeted information\u2019. This report, requested by the European Parliament, is targeted at policy makers and the public and is timed to assist the European Parliament in its debate on the European Commission\u2019s Communication on Environmental Agreements published in November 1996. Main conclusions of the report EAs appear to be of most use as complements to other policy measures, such as regulations and fiscal instruments, where they can make a valuable contribution, especially in terms of their ability to raise awareness, create consensus and to provide a forum for information-sharing among different parties. EAs also seem to be useful in improving environmental management in industry and business Compared to other policy instruments, e.g. taxes, few evaluations of EAs, whether ex-ante or ex-post, have been made and there is little literature available on their use. The report aims to help fill this gap by trying to assess the environmental effectiveness of six different EAs. These particular EAs were selected to cover various countries, sectors and themes. In most cases it was not possible to make a quantitative assessment of the environmental effectiveness of the agreements due to the lack of reliable monitoring data and consistent reporting, which prevented comparisons being made between the current situation and what would most likely have happened if no agreement had been concluded (the \u2018business-as-usual\u2019 situation). Some wider benefits were found, however, including environmental improvements on the situation prior to the agreement and the encouragement of environmental management in business. Since the late 1980s, there has been an increased use of Environmental Agreements (EAs) as policy tools in EU Member States, especially in industry and waste management. This approach to environmental management, mirrors current trends of consensus-building and participatory processes in public policy and complements the traditional command-and-control approach. EAs reflect both the development of shared responsibilities and the integration of environmental considerations into company management structures. Some concerns have been expressed, however, about the rise of EAs as a new policy instrument, particularly by parties that are not involved in their negotiation, such as the European Parliament and NGOs. If EAs are to be used more widely, it is necessary to improve their credibility and accountability. This calls for the setting of clear targets, for greater transparency during the negotiation, implementation and evaluation of EAs and for the introduction of reliable monitoring and reporting arrangements. In the European Commission\u2019s Communication on Environmental Agreements, guidelines were presented for the use of EAs, aimed at improving both their credibility among the various stakeholders and their effectiveness. These guidelines include: the setting of quantified objectives, the monitoring of results, periodic reporting, the verification of results, and provisions for access to information and for the accession of third parties.

The proposal includes a report which recognizes the promising results from the first full two years of work of the Agency. The proposal affirms the existing tasks and mandate of the Agency, and defines certain tasks relating to support to the implementation of European Union environmental legislation and the diffusion of environmental information, where the Agency's role could be enforced. The Agency should develop into a one-stop-shop for environment information and data with modern Internet-based communications to facilitate access across Europe. Upon a proposal of Ritt Bjerregaard, Commissioner for the Environment, the European Commission has today adopted a proposal to amend the Regulation 1210/90 which governs the functions and tasks of the European Environment Agency. This revision was required by the terms of the Agency Regulation. This proposal includes a report that illustrates good progress and promising first results from the first full two years of work of the European Environment Agency. In this short period of time, the agency has succeeded in building the basis of a European network of institutions and individuals who can contribute to our knowledge on the state and prospects of the environment. The first fruits of this collaboration are now available, notably information on air pollution, water issues, land cover and the 1995 reports 'Europe's environment: the Dobris assessment' and 'Environment in the European Union'. To build on these first results, the Commission has agreed a programme of co-operation with the Agency, notably on the production of a pan-European State of the Environment Report in 1998. This sort of detailed information will be an important component of environment policy making and the Agency is now well placed to deliver the goods. However, to be able to produce this report and the supporting work which underpins it, the Agency must have the opportunity to build upon the progress it has achieved. This proposal is aimed at ensuring just that. This proposal recognises the promising start made by the Agency and the need to ensure that these first efforts are consolidated and reinforced. The proposal affirms the existing tasks and mandate of the Agency but defines in more detail certain tasks where the participation of the Agency could be strengthened, such as support to the implementation of Community environmental legislation; diffusion of information on environmental research of relevance to policy makers; and in particular, the Agency should develop into a European Reference Centre, a one-stop-shop for environment information and data with modern Internet-based communications to facilitate access across Europe. This review is the first step in an on-going process to ensure the best possible orientation and relevance of the Agency's work and products. This first assessment is- positive and the consequent proposal will give the Agency the opportunity to progress further and to provide much needed information on the state of the environment. Background Information The decision to establish the Agency in Denmark (Copenhagen) was taken in October 1993. It has 60 or so staff and an annual budget which is currently 16.7 Mecu. Its remit was to provide policy-makers at national and European level with comparable, objective and reliable information on the environment. Article 20 of the Regulation 1210/90 required a review of tasks by October 1995, but this was postponed for two years by Council following initial delays in getting the Agency to full operational capacity.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/review.html"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_1009", "date": "1997-06-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EEA: improved access to information is a driving force for environmental improvement", "text": "Copenhagen, 6 June 1997 \u00a0 EEA: improved access to information is a driving force for environmental improvement Today, the European Environment Agency (EEA) published an Experts\u2019 Corner Report on Public Access to Environmental Information in Europe The report, written by Ralph Hallo (Stichting Natuur en Milieu, NL), an expert in the field, with a foreword by Ken Collins, MEP, Chairman of the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, describes the issues at stake in the current debate about improved access to environmental information & public participation in environmental decision-making in both the European Union and the UN ECE-framework. Quote Ken Collins, MEP: \"This report on public access to environmental information has come at a particularly timely moment, namely the beginnings of the review of Directive 90/313/EEC on freedom of access to information on the environment. Since the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, nationals of Member States have had citizenship of the Union; although this confers at present very limited rights and duties, it is the germ of a future in which the citizen can look to the Union as a real polity. In conjunction with moves towards greater transparency and accountability in Union decision-making, the EU is in the process of becoming closer to its citizens: a process which all democrats should support and help to continue. A major factor in this drive for accountability and real citizenship is access to information. Citizens must be informed about policy making in order to make reasoned decisions about it. This is particularly important in the field of environmental policy, which is both at the heart of taking mankind into the new millennium and an essential part of the Union\u2019s policy competence. My Committee has been vociferous in its advocacy of extended public access to environmental information for many years, and expects the Union to make substantial progress in this matter\". The report offers an overview of the principal instruments for providing the public with access to environmental information. It covers the 15 EU Member States, as well as the situation in countries of the European Economic Area and Central and Eastern Europe. Directive 90/313/EEC on freedom of access to environmental information, which has been in effect since 1993, is the most significant law concerning public access to environmental information. It establishes a general right of any person to environmental information held by public (and quasi-public) authorities subject to specified exceptions. The Directive represents a dramatic change for most Member States, introducing openness where secrecy was the rule. Four years of experience have shown, however, that the process of change is a gradual one and that continued progress, both in terms of the quantity and the quality of the information available, is still desirable. The report covers in particular the developments at EU level and the UN ECE efforts to elaborate a draft-Convention on Access to Environmental Information and Public Participation in Environmental Decision-Making. This draft-Convention will be on the agenda of the next Pan-European Environment Ministers\u2019 Conference, scheduled to take place in \u00c5rhus, Denmark, in June 1998. Ralph Hallo, author of the report said: \"The real challenge is not just putting the terms of the Directive and similar legal instruments to use, but the real challenge lies in anticipating and adjusting to future demands and technological innovation. The paper paradigm of Directive 90/313/EEC appears increasingly in need of adaptation to the realities of today\u2019s world of modems and megabytes. Monitoring, retrieval and transmission of data can take place with a precision and rapidity not commonly known even a few years ago. This is also the challenge for the EEA: to help the parties concerned - governments, researchers, industry, environmental organisations and citizens - to develop effective systems of data collection, storage, retrieval, transmission and availability while working with a multitude of diverse systems (and languages) so that the data that enters the system can emerge as useful information\". Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n, EEA\u2019s Executive Director, said: \"The European Environment Agency is already trying to meet this challenge in many ways. We are helping Member States - at their request - to build up their environmental data collection systems, we are compiling a Catalogue of Data Sources on the environment in order to rapidly become the \"one-stop-shop\" for environmental information in Europe, and we are working together with the G7 countries to build a virtual global environmental information mall. Simultaneously, we are actively providing access for the public to all Agency publications and databases through our web-site, which currently receives more than 200,000 visits/month. The Agency will shortly be looking with the Commission services and Member States\u2019 administrations at the possibilities of improving public access to environmental information through more extensive use of the World Wide Web. In the Agency, we have learned from experience that this is the easiest, fastest and most cost-efficient way of providing access to environmental information to the public at large. Improving access to environmental information will lead to more informed citizens, who will ask for stricter environmental standards. It will also lead to improved enforcement of environmental standards, as public pressure for better enforcement of environmental laws will grow. Thus, environmental information will become more and more the driving force for environmental improvement in Europe and beyond\".

Almost 2 years after the EEA\u2019s first appearance on the World Wide Web, the web-site has been completely restructured and restyled. Due to the growing number of documents the EEA has produced, a new structure for the site was required to improve the navigation possibilities. Its structure and content allows for a whole range of uses: from keeping up-to-date on environmental news and events, finding out more about the role of the EEA, examining a specific report in detail, or simply as a convenient link to other environment-related sites. The web-site can be found at http://www.eea.europa.eu The EEA web-site is structured in the following sections: Documents: All the documents on the site are found here: the EEA newsletters, press releases and brochures; full text or abstracts from major reports including the \u2018Three-yearly Reports\u2019 and the current Annual Work Programme, plus monographs, articles and papers New: Environmental news stories, most recent EEA projects and other new additions to the web-site. Events: The EEA maintains a database of forthcoming events within the environmental domain which can be accessed from this page. Everybody is welcome to suggest additional events to be included in this database. About EEA: Information about the EEA itself: how it came into being, its aims and objectives, organisation, geographical scope and membership, and on a more personal note, information about its staff members and opportunities within the Agency Projects: Overviews of EEA projects with relevant documents, findings, current status etc. with a special focus on the preparation for the next \u2018State of the European environment report\u2019 Links: The EEA is not the only provider of environmental information on the Internet. In order to fulfil its role as \u2018one-stop-shop\u2019 for environmental information, the EEA will try as much as possible to provide links to other environmental organisations. If the EEA does not hold information itself, it tells you where the information most likely can be found Databases: Some selected databases are already available and more will gradually be made accessible on-line for collaborating EIONET institutions and general users. They cover: Air Emissions, Air Quality, Catalogue of Data Sources, Inland Waters, Land Cover and Nature Conservation. Search/Index: Enables you to locate immediately a particular topic, report or event Unique for the web-site is the large number of documents in several languages. A special section is created to give easy access to documents in many European languages. Some of these documents don\u2019t even exist in printed versions. The opening of the new web-site coincides together with the launch of the EIONET (European Environment Information and Observation Network) Intranet. This Intranet connects the EEA\u2019s National Focal Points in 15 EU member countries in a collaborative network Located in the heart of Copenhagen, the EEA is the environmental information reference centre of the European Union.

EIONET, which stands for European Environment Information and Observation Network, is used for moving data and information around in the process of monitoring the state and trends in environment. The 2 million ECU network is funded by the European Commission\u2019s \"Interchange of Data between Administrations\" Programme (IDA) that helps governments in building telematic networks across Europe, thus offering more efficient, transparent and responsive public services to the industry and citizens. The technical set-up of EIONET has been done by Finsiel SpA., a major Italian information technology corporation, and European Dynamics, a Greek company specialised on Internet. Expansion of the Intranet to three West-European EFTA countries and 11 Phare countries in Eastern Europe is being contracted out. The Agency also has eight Topic Centres that are being connected now. The entire Intranet will thus cover about 40 leading environmental institutions in almost all European countries. The Agency also operates an Extranet that connects it with other public institutions, companies, and interest groups. The full EIONET covers hundreds of nodes. Netscape SuiteSpot provides the basic functionality of the EIONET Intranet. Each node will boast a full range of Netscape servers. New services provided by SuiteSpot version 3 will be introduced gradually. According to Hannu Saarenmaa, IT Manager at EEA, \"Netscape SuiteSpot was chosen because its cross-platform availability, open standards compliance, and modularity that allow adding new services as needed.\" Services of the EIONET Intranet include email, document sharing, discussions, directories, and information locator services. The Intranet has been built as a virtual private network on top of public Internet links. Says Jef Maes, Programme Manager at EEA: \"We chose Internet because it gives us biggest potential to expand to new partners and makes our Intranet and Extranet to function seamlessly.\" Located in the heart of Copenhagen, the EEA is the environmental information reference centre of the European Union. Its mission is to monitor the state and trends of the environment in Europe and support the European Union and member countries in improving their environmental policy and its implementation.

This is the main conclusion of a report from the European Environment Agency (EEA), the European Commission, WHO , OECD & Environment Ministries from the UK, Sweden, The Netherlands1. Key conclusions are : Sufficient evidence exists that testicular cancer rates are increasing; The apparent decline in sperm counts in some countries was likely to be genuine and not attributable to methodological variables; There is insufficient evidence to definitely establish a causal link between the health effects seen in humans with exposure to chemicals; Compared with the situation in the USA, there are few cases of reproductive ill-health in wildlife in the EU where the effects could be definitely associated with endocrine disrupting substances (maybe we are not looking hard enough); The considerable uncertainties and data gaps could be reduced by the recommendations on research and monitoring into exposure and effects in wildlife and humans - forty specific activities are proposed in the report; Meanwhile, consideration should be given to reducing the exposure of humans and wildlife to endocrine disrupters in line with the \"Precautionary Principle.\" \"Policy makers and the public need to be aware of \"early warnings\" about potentially serious and irreversible health and environmental hazards\", said Domingo Jim\u00e9nez - Beltr\u00e1n, Executive Director, the European Environment Agency2. \"The Agency will now be helping to develop the European-wide strategy for monitoring chemicals in the environment and in particular potential endocrine disrupting substances (EDS), focusing on particular puzzles such as why testicular cancer rates in some EU neighbouring countries, for example, Finland and Denmark3, are so different. Our future work on pooling best practice in clean production and chemical exposure reduction will help businesses and others to implement cost-effective measures for reducing any possible risks to reproductive health from these substances\", said Mr Jim\u00e9nez - Beltr\u00e1n. As \"many EDS' have toxic effects other than their potential for damaging reproductive health, precautionary action in reducing exposures to them now could produce multiple benefits.\" Denmark helped initiate this \"early warning\" on EDS' when Professor Niels Skakkebaek published his report on the striking decline in sperm counts amongst males world wide between 1940 and 19904. \"This early work has now been recognised as pointing to potentially serious health effects from Endocrine Disrupters, but as the report makes clear, we must do much more research before cause and effect can be elucidated. For example, it is possible that these reproductive problems could be caused by something other than Endocrine disrupting substances, e.g. stress and other aspects of lifestyle\", said Professor Skakkebaek. \"We are leading a European consortium of scientists who are trying to implement some of the report's recommendations such as an international data bank on semen quality.\" 5 Further information is available from David Gee at the EEA (+45) 33 36 71 42 (home 35 26 27 16); and Professor Skakkebaek at the Dept. of Growth and Reproduction Rigshospitalet, the National University Hospital of Denmark, tel (+45) 35 45 50 85 or home 42 95 85 07; Canice Nolan, European Commission, DG XII (+32 2) 296 16 33, and Philippe Bourdeau, Chair, EEA Scientific Committee, tel (+32 2) 650 43 22 / 23. 1Report from the \"European Workshop on the impact of Endocrine Disrupters on Human Health and Wildlife\", published by DG XII, European Commission, April 16th 1997.

Water stress - shortages, floods, pollution and damaged ecosystems (see graphic) - requires radical new approaches to the use and management of water resources if Europeans are to avoid severe water crises, the joint Statement concludes. \"We have a 19th century approach to 21st century problems\", says Domingo Jim\u00e9nez Beltr\u00e1n, EEA's Executive Director. \"We just think of supplying new dams and pipelines (\"megalitres\") rather than increasing water use efficiency (\"negalitres\"). Prices don't cover the full cost of supplying and using water, which encourages its inefficient use. An integrated approach to water quality and quantity is needed.\" Some of the main points in the Statement include: The low availability of water demanded for households, agriculture, and industry. Drinking-water losses from pipes are estimated at 30% in most countries and up to 70-80% in some cities. As water shortages increase, river basin authorities are restricting water-use for industry. Similar pressures on agriculture are likely to occur in the near future. About 60% of large European cities are over-exploiting their groundwater resources for their drinking and other water needs. If depleted or polluted, these resources are expensive and time-consuming to restore. Other threats include the increase of the global mean sea level due to changes in climate and run-off patterns of water courses in some areas. \"Concerted action at the European level is becoming more and more essential,\" says Frits Schlingemann, UNEP's Representative and Regional Director for Europe. \"International organizations provide a forum for promoting and complementing national action through international cooperation. Detailed and reliable information as well as analyses of the world's fresh water systems can help promote solutions for easing related environmental pressures.\" The Statement summarises many water initiatives, such as the proposed European Union Water Resources Framework Directive, the Cleaner Production Programme of UNEP, and the improved pollution monitoring work of the EEA. It stresses that new political agreements on integrated river basin management and greater public support for new types of policy instruments such as taxes, voluntary agreements and tradable permits are needed if these initiatives are to be implemented successfully.

Further notes: The EEA provides objective, reliable and comparable information on Europe's environment for those concerned with framing and implementing European and national environmental policy, and for the public. UNEP is the environmental conscience of the United Nations system, having a mandate to provide leadership and to encourage partnerships in caring for the environment, with a strong regional emphasis. Negalitres refer to demand side management (DSM) which focuses on the more efficient use of water by reducing losses, less wasteful use of water, more efficient appliances, and water recycling. In many cases it is cheaper and more effective to improve water use efficiency than it is to increase water supplies. For example, water efficiency measures reduced the consumption of water in Madrid by 25 per cent between 1992 and 1994. This is the equivalent to a reservoir providing over 100 million m3 of water per year. The use of 6-litre toilet water flushes in the UK, rather than the usual 9 litres, would save 10 per cent of the UK's household water use, according to a recent estimate. Inefficient use: The prices of nitrates and pesticides on agricultural land do not include the full costs of their use, such as their pollution of groundwater and the expense of treating these drinking water supplies so as to meet EU water quality standards. Water quality and quantity are linked. For example, polluted water can reduce available supplies; and channelisation of rivers can improve drainage in adjacent farmland, but it also destroys aquatic life in the river, reducing its pollution-filtering activity, and the risk of downstream flooding is increased by the speeding up of water flow. \u00a0 European water demand, 1950\u00ad2000 Source: WHO/UNEP, 1989", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/ws.html"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_1014", "date": "1996-10-03", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EEA study shows effectiveness of green taxes to achieve environmental goals", "text": "Copenhagen, 3 October 1996 PRESS RELEASE Eea study shows effectiveness of green taxes to achieve environmental goals Green taxes seem to be effective in achieving environmental goals and should be used more often. A continuing increase in the use of environmental taxes can already be recognised over the last decade. However, there are political barriers to their implementation but these can be overcome by careful design and extensive consultation. These are some of the findings of a report on environmental taxes published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) The findings are based on evaluation studies of 16 environmental taxes that have been identified and reviewed by the EEA. These taxes have been environmentally effective (achieving their environmental objectives) and they seem to have achieved such objectives at reasonable cost. Examples of particularly successful green taxes include those on sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in Sweden, on toxic waste in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg/Germany, on water pollution in The Netherlands, and on the tax differentials on leaded fuel and 'cleaner' diesel fuel in Sweden. Although the EU's Fifth Environmental Action Programme (1992), \"Towards Sustainability\", recommended the greater use of economic and fiscal measures for environmental purposes, there has been little progress since 1992 in the use of environmental taxes at the EU level. At the national level, however, there has been a continuing increase in the use of environmental taxes over the last decade, with a particular acceleration over the last 5-6 years. This is mainly apparent in Scandinavia, but it is also noticeable in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Still, the overall use of environmental taxes as a percentage of total taxes is small (1.5 percent in 1993) and only slowly increasing. This figure does not, however, take into account energy-related taxes which had a share of 5.2 percent of total taxes in 1993 with a gradually increasing tendency. These are the main conclusions of a report on environmental taxes (\"Environmental Taxes: Implementation and Environmental Effectiveness\", EEA Environmental Issues Series no.1, Copenhagen 1996) as published today by the EEA. The report was requested by the Committee on Environment, Health and Consumer Protection of the European Parliament (EP). The report was presented on the 3rd October 1996 at an international conference of representatives of parliamentary environment committees from EU Member States, as well as members of the EP/Committee. The conference was organised by the Environment and Regional Planning Committee of the Danish Parliament (Folketing). The EEA report provides an overview of the main issues involved in environmental taxes, with a particular focus on their environmental effectiveness and on the political barriers to their implementation and options of reducing them. It also emphasises the value of non-energy taxes. In addition to their environmental effectiveness, green taxes could deliver improvements in three key areas of public policy: innovation and competitiveness, employment, and the tax system. Environmental taxes can thus deliver a multiple dividend. Moreover, as environmental concerns move from point-source emissions and problems, such as industrial emissions from pipelines and chimneys, to include more diffuse and mobile sources of pollution, such as solid waste, or from the agricultural and transport sectors, there is increased scope for the greater use of green taxes, as well as other market based instruments, in order to achieve environmental targets, both at the EU and the national level. The use of environmental taxes can be expanded in 3 main ways: their extension to more European countries; increasing their harmonisation and compatibility at the EU level; developing new areas for green taxes, e.g. on aviation, shipping and road tranport, tourism, land use, water resources, minerals and hazardous chemicals. There are, however, several important political barriers to the introduction of environmental taxes, particularly energy taxes: perceived impacts on competitiveness and low-income groups; perceived conflicts between national taxes and EU or world trade, rules; the perception that taxes have to be high if they are to work; the EU unanimity rule when voting on fiscal measures; existing subsidies and regulations, as well as other policies and cultures. However, most barriers to implementation, especially of energy taxes, such as the potential negative impacts on competitiveness, employment (particularly on specific sectors or regions) and low income groups can be overcome by: careful design; the use of environmental taxes and respective revenues as part of policy packages and green tax reforms; gradual implementation; extensive information of and consultation with all parties concerned. The EEA recommends that more evaluation studies of environmental taxes are carried out since only a few have been made until now. Also, more independent reviews of the environmental effectiveness of green taxes would help gain more experience. This could then be used to help guide the wider application of environmental taxes as advocated by the EU's Fifth Environmental Action Programme.", "url": "https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/gt_press.html"}, {"id": "EEA_NEWS_1015", "date": "1996-09-06", "text_type": "NEWS", "title": "EEA: Current EU measures insufficient to prevent further increase of CO2 emissions after the year 2000", "text": "EEA: Current EU measures insufficient to prevent further increase of CO2 emissions after the year 2000 PRESS RELEASE Copenhagen, 6 September 1996 The European Union is making progress in stabilising emissions of greenhouse gases to date. However, there is considerable uncertainty whether the EU will meet the target of stabilisation of C02 emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Current measures are insufficient to prevent a further increase in CO2 emissions after the year 2000. If the EU wants to achieve its targets of avoiding adverse effects, an accelerated policy is needed. A reduction in the range of at least 30%-55% of all greenhouse gases might be needed in industrialised countries (including the EU) by 2010 compared to 1990 levels, depending on the expectations for the range of emissions in developing countries. These are the main conclusions of an assessment of the trends, state and outlook of the environmental theme climate change as presented by the European Environment Agency (EEA) on GLOBE's conference Responding to Climate Change in Linz (Austria) today. The assessment is an update of the assessment reported by the EEA in \"Environment in the European Union - 1995; Report for the Review of the Fifth Environmental Action Programme (SEAP)\". The main conclusions of this present assessment are a confirmation of the conclusions of the report mentioned, which showed that climate change should be one of the key issues on which to focus future policy at the European level. Mitigating climate change will have significant positive side effects for other environmental issues, such as ozone depletion, acidification, air quality and waste management. Facts and Figures The latest, Second Assessment Report of IPCC (1995) concluded inter alia that \"the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate\". From 1990, global CO2 emissions did not grow, mainly due to the economic recession/restructuring in the central and eastern European countries. The emissions of CFCs have decreased in this period. However, total greenhouse gas emissions in OECD countries have increased, whereas the UNFCCC target is to stabilise the emissions between 1990 and 2000. The global average annual per capita emissions of CO2 due to the combustion of fossil fuels is at present about 4 tonnes, while in developed and transitional economy countries it is about 10 tonnes (in EU 8.8 tonnes) and in developing countries about 2 tonnes. After a period of steady increase, total emissions of carbon dioxide in the European Union fell slightly (2 %) between 1990 and 1994, mainly due to short-term factors, such as the temporary decrease of industrial and economic growth rates, the restructuring of industry in Germany, the closing of coal mines in the UK, and the conversion of power plants to natural gas. Although CO2 emissions from industry and the energy sector have decreased, emissions from the transport sector show an increase. The atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, inter alia CO2, CH4 and N2O, have grown significantly since pre-industrial times: by about 30 %, 145 % and 15 % respectively. In the same period global mean surface air temperature has increased by between about 0.3 and 0.6 degrees Celcius. 1995 has been reported as the warmest year ever since pre-industrial times. Outlook Achieving the target of stabilisation of EU CO2 emissions at 1990 levels by 2000 seems to be the cornerstone of EU environmental policy. There is, however, great uncertainty about whether the EU will meet this target. Most studies indicate an increase of emissions up to 5 % in 2000, compared to 1990. The main causes for this overshoot are: continuous transport growth, remaining low energy prices, the slow improvement of energy efficiency and the fact that many of the measures in National Programmes will not be completed before 2000. Current measures are insufficient to prevent a further increase in CO2 emissions after 2000 as a result of the expected growth of production, consumption and transport. However, to achieve the stabilisation of the concentration of greenhouse gases at the lowest possible level in the shortest possible time, substantial emission reductions are necessary. The EU has recently declared that global average temperatures should not exceed 2 degrees Celcius above pre-industrial level. Current EU policies are now focusing on post 2000 target setting, timetables and adequate burden sharing strategies inside the EU. Global distribution of emissions and timing of actions are the key issues in climate change policy. Present scientific knowledge suggests that to reduce major risks for ecosystems, food production and sensitive coastal areas, emissions in industrialised countries (including the EU) should be reduced by at least 30 to 55 % in 2010 compared to 1990 levels. This (wide) range reflects the expectations regarding the future of developing countries. If these countries develop an accelerated climate change policy and reduce economic and population growth, industrialised countries may follow the bottom limit of the range (minimal 30%). Otherwise, the upper limit (minimal 55%) is required.

These pollutants contribute to several environmental problems : climate change, acidification, tropospheric ozone and (urban) air quality. Only total emissions for EU 15 are presented at this stage. These results are provisional; the EEA is continuing to work with national authorities to quality assure the data for individual countries and will present these more detailed data within the next few weeks. European air emissions from 1990 to 1994 (provisional) In the table the emissions for 1994 as prepared by the EEA's ETC/AEM are presented. For comparison also the emissions for 1990 are presented. The emissions for 1990 are those prepared by the EEA 4) for all compounds, except for NH3 and SO2 for which CORINAIR1990 1) data were used. In all cases emissions from natural sources and CO2 sinks have been excluded. Pollutant 5) Total 1990 (1000 tonnes) Total 1994 (1000 tonnes) Change(%) (1994/1990) SO2 16500 12100 -27 NOx 13600 12300 -10 NMVOC 14400 13900 -3 CH4 24700 22800 -8 CO 52000 43300 -17 CO2 3290000 3230000 -2 N2O 1020 910 -11 NH3 3920 3510 -10 Pollutants For SO2the downward trend is clear. A reduction of almost 27% has been achieved relative to 1990 emissions, mainly due to several measures in the energy sector, such as shift from coal to gas and low sulphur coal and the installation of Flue Gas Desulphurisation systems. The EU target in the Fifth Environmental Action Programme (5EAP) is a 35 % reduction of the 1985 levels in 2000 3). The actual reduction achieved in 1994 relative to the emissions in 1985 (E12 and Sweden, Finland and Austria) is 39 %. So if these reductions are maintained the EU target has already been reached. The UNECE has set a tighter target (Revised Sulphur Protocol, 1994) related to the closure of the gap between existing deposition of acidifying compounds and the \"critical loads\". Reduction targets differ for countries but are approximately 63 % related to 1980 levels to achieve the UNECE target of 60 % gap closure 3). The actual reduction in 1994 related to 1980 is 55 %, which means that the UNECE target is close to being met, but still depends on further reduction plans of the countries involved. Furthermore it should be noted that the following statement from the EEA Report 3) is still valid regarding SO2 and NOx emissions (see below) \"even meeting the new targets will mean that there are still ecosystems in Europe where critical acid loads are exceeded. Although overall acid deposition levels have decreased (and this will continue in the future, mainly due to SO2emission reduction), critical loads will still be exceeded in more sensitive regions\". The emissions of NOxare showing some decrease (of 10 %), mainly due to the economic recession and the introduction of abatement measures in the transport sector (3-way catalysts) and small decreases in industrial production. The EU target of stabilisation of emissions in 1994 3) on the 1985 level appears to have been met. It is not yet clear whether the second EU target of 30 % emission reduction in 2000 will be met. According to the EEA Report 3) on the likely trend to the year 2000 : \"NOxemissions are likely to stabilise or decrease slightly in the future. This is due to traffic growth, although some forecasts suggest that the EU targets for 2000 could be fully met if all current and proposed legislation were fully implemented. The limitations to achievements are related to : the slow rate of turnover of the vehicle fleet (newer engines, 3-way catalytic convertors), problems with the effectiveness of catalytic convertors in practice, the lack of new technologies, the lack of policies for freight transport, the lack of progress in mode switching from road/private transport to public transport, the cost of biofuels\". The more recent proposals from the Commission, following from the Auto-Oil Programme, aim at further reducing emissions from new vehicles over the next 10 years and may contribute to some additional reductions in total NOx emissions prior to 2000 (and will produce more significant reductions after 2000 as the vehicle fleet changes). Furthermore care has to be taken regarding the data for emission reduction between 1990 and 1994, because in some countries the methodology for estimating NOx emissions from some sources has changed between 1990 and 1994. Therefore it is needed to update the emission estimates of 1990 using the same (new) methodology. This might lead to lower estimates for the emission in 1990 and therefore less emission decrease. The EEA is presently preparing such an update, which will be published in the near future. The emissions of CO2are showing a slight reduction of 2 %, mainly due to short-term factors, like temporary decrease of industrial production resulting in lower energy consumption, lower energy consumption in Germany (brown coal) due to restructuring of industry, closing of coal mines in the UK and conversion of power plants to natural gas in several countries. In the EEA Report 3) it was mentioned that \"there is great uncertainty about whether the EU will meet the target of stabilisation of the emissions at 1990 level in 2000. The main causes of uncertainty are : continuing transport growth, continuing low energy prices, slow improvement of energy efficiency, many measures in national programmes will not be completed before 2000\". The total anthropogenic emission and percentage change for CO2 are in line with the recently 6) published estimates of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion only. Fossil fuel related emissions account for about 96 percent of the total emissions and the EEA and Eurostat fuel related emission estimates both are based on national energy statistics. Regarding the other pollutants, all of them show a decrease of emissions, between 3 and 17 %. However the same remark as for NOx should be taken into account, that these reductions may be partly due to change of estimation methodology and that final conclusions can only be drawn after updating the 1990 estimates and finalising the 1994 estimates. As mentioned before, the EEA will publish such an update in the near future. For further information, please contact: For general questions: Ernst R.

The work programme was given the name CORINE - \"CO-oRdination d'INformation Environnementale\" and included a project to gather and organise information on emissions into the air relevant to acid deposition - Corinair. This project started in 1986 with the objective of compiling a co-ordinated inventory of atmospheric emissions from the 12 Member States of the Community in 1985 (Corinair 1985). The Co-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long Range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP) formed by a Protocol under the UNECE Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution Convention has developed guidelines for estimation and reporting of emission data for SOx, NOx, NMVOCs, CH4, NH3 and CO under the Convention. The Corinair 1985 Inventory was developed in collaboration with the Member States, Eurostat, OECD and UNECE/EMEP. The Inventory was completed in 1990 and the results have been published (Eurostat, 1991; CEC, 1995) and widely distributed in tabular and map forms. Pending a decision on the location of the EEA, it was agreed in 1991 to produce an update of Corinair for 1990 (Corinair 1990). This update has been performed in co-operation with EMEP and IPCC-OECD to assist in the preparation of inventories required under the UNECE Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) Convention and the Framework Climate Change Convention (FCCC) respectively. The European Environment Agency (EEA) was set up on 30 October 1993, in Copenhagen, to provide objective, reliable and comparable information for those concerned with framing and implementing European and national environmental policy, and for the public. It is funded by the European Union but its coverage extends beyond the EU 15 countries to include Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, who are represented on the EEA Management Board, and to other countries of Central & Eastern Europe, provided the resources are made available. The EEA co-ordinates the European Environment Information and Observation Network (EIONET), which covers 8 European Topic Centres (ETCs), 18 National Focal Points (from the 18 member states of the EEA, which are the EU15, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and many National Reference Centres appointed for specific topics by the member states. The ETCs are funded from the EEA budget. The activities of the ETCs are described in the EEA's Annual Work Programme and the EEA Annual Report 1995. The CORINAIR system has been integrated in the work programme of the EEA in 1994, and the work is continuing through the ETC on Air Emissions (ETC/AEM). It is the task of the ETC/AEM to develop the methodology and prepare emission inventories for 1994 and subsequent years. The first results for 1994 are now available.

This will reinforce the activities of UNEP and EEA in the preparation of the next Conference of European Environment Ministers to be held in Denmark in 1998. Harmonisation of UNEP's ENRIN (1) Programme and the EEA's extended EIONET (2) are at the heart of the unique partnership announced today by Hans Alders, UNEP's Director and Regional Representative for Europe and Domingo Jim\u00e9nez-Beltr\u00e1n, Executive Director of the EEA. In order to make the most efficient use of existing capacities and resources, the EEA and UNEP are proceeding with all possible speed to harmonise their activities, contacts, network structure and technical bases of their respective networks and capacity building programmes. This co-operation will be to the benefit of all their European partners, particularly in the CIS, Central and Eastern countries. The extension of the EIONET to Central and Eastern European countries is being made possible through the funding of the European Commission's PHARE programme (3). The harmonisation of ENRIN and the extended EIONET network, will therefore mean that UNEP, EEA and PHARE will be able to work more closely together to improve the quality of environmental information for the countries in transition. The EIONET-ENRIN harmonisation will provide a better means of addressing Europe's environmental problems. Their activities will help Central and Eastern European countries both improve access to and promote the use of environmental data and information within and between countries and at the European level. The harmonisation of networks will contribute significantly to the strengthening and consolidation of the technical base needed to support data gathering and dissemination, and result in more open access to data, improved data quality and standards, and lead to harmonised reporting on the state of Europe's environment. In particular, the EEA-UNEP co-operation will directly contribute to the development of the assessment requested at the Sofia pan-European Environment Ministers Conference in October 1996, to plot the progress and prospects of European environmental problems. This report is a key input for improved understanding and decision making at the next Ministerial conference to be hosted by the Danish government in May 1998. Notes for Editors The UNEP ENRIN programme (Environment and Natural Resource Information Networking), which began in 1994, was established to improve access to environmental data and information for governments and decision-makers, and to promote the development of national and sub-regional capacities for environmental data management, through the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and similar computer technologies. The activities are regional, sub-regional and national in scope, and where appropriate may be used to develop further Global Resource Information Database (GRID)-compatible centres in Central and Eastern Europe. The ultimate aim is to improve capabilities to access and use environmental data for State-of-Environment reports, assessments and decision-making for sustainable development. Thus far, significant progress has been made in the Baltic States, Georgia, Hungary, Russia, Ukraine and the Black Sea region. The EEA's European Information and Observation Network (EIONET) links together the EEA, the EU Commission, the national environment centres of EEA countries (EU + Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and European Topic Centres in a computerised web of data monitoring and analysis. The overall aim is to provide objective, reliable and comparable environmental information for the European Community and Member States to enable them to take the requisite measures to protect the environment and to ensure that the public is properly informed. The extended EIONET to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) is focused on providing practical tools to improve the quality of environmental information from CEE countries. The activities include: personnel training; technical back-up with hardware, software and other equipment; and help with disseminating information via workshops, publications etc. Part of the new programme involves extending the EEA European Topic Centres on Air Quality, Air Emissions and Inland Waters to the PHARE countries. The European Union's PHARE programme provides grant finance to support its partner countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CCEE) to the stage where they are ready to assume the obligations of EU membership. Apart from the CCEE co-operation with the European Environment Agency, launched today, the multi-country environment programme of PHARE supports projects in a wide number of areas including the Black Triangle, Danube Basin, the Black Sea and the Baltic.

Following the mandate that the EEA was granted at the Sofia Environment Ministers' Conference in October 1995, and the advanced state of UNEP's activities in CEE countries, an integration of these activities has now begun which will greatly benefit and reinforce the work of these two agencies throughout the entire region. In order to maximise and consolidate existing capacities and resources, EEA and UNEP are proceeding with all reasonable speed to harmonise inasmuch as possible the activities, contacts, structure and technical bases of their respective networks and capacity building programmes. This involves EIONET1 and its possible extension to Central and Eastern Europe on the part of the Agency (made possible through the funding of the European Commission's multicountry PHARE programme), and ENRIN2 on the part of UNEP. This co-operation which is being discussed in this seminar will be to the greater benefit of all European partners, particularly in the CIS, Central and Eastern countries and sub-regions, as well as to EEA and UNEP. The purpose of this extension of the EEA environment network (EIONET) is to co-ordinate and improve environmental information for use at European level by policy makers and the public. The UNEP ENRIN programme aims to establish networks and strengthen the data and information management capacities of national and sub-regional environmental institutions. The overall objective is to improve access to environmental data and information and their use in decision-making for sustainable development. The national and sub-regional partners of the programme together provide access not only to an entire network of agencies and institutions, but in particular vitally-needed data and information, which ultimately contribute to improved \"state-of-environment\" assessments and other types of reporting. The \"extended EIONET\"-ENRIN co-operation will lead to a general harmonisation of the two activities. It will cover institutional issues (contact points etc), programmatic issues (joint activities and events) and technical considerations (data standards and networking). This will improve the efficiency of EEA and UNEP activities in Central and Eastern Europe and contribute to the harmonisation of environmental standards across the region. 1European environment Information and Observation NETwork 2Environment and Natural Resource Information Networking For further information: European Environment Agency David Stanners, Programme Manager Kongens Nytorv 6 DK-1050 Copenhagen K Tel. + (45) 33 36 71 00 Fax. + (45) 33 36 71 99 United Nations Environmental Programme UNEP Ronald G.
