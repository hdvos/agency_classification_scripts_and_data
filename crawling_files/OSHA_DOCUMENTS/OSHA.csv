It also aims to expand EU’s capacities and systems for cancer’s prevention, early detection, treatment, care and survivorship. Work-related cancer represents one of the biggest health problems that faces EU workplaces. In 2015, this accounts for an estimated 53 % of all work-related deaths in the EU and other developed countries. According to the Roadmap on Carcinogens in 2016, about 120,000 work-related cancer cases occur each year because of exposure to carcinogens at work in the EU, leading to approximately 80,000 fatalities annually.

OSHA_UNK_0040	2021-07-02	UNK	New report on driver fatigue in European Road Transport released	According to a new study conducted by the European Transport Workers’ Federation (ETF), fatigue among professional drivers is now the norm on European roads. The report, based on a survey of around 3,000 truck, bus and coach drivers, is the first EU-wide study in 15 years on driver fatigue in passenger and freight road transport. The findings include that 60% of truck drivers and 66% of bus and coach drivers have to drive while fatigued on a regular basis. Also, nearly one third of lorry drivers have reported falling asleep at the wheel while driving. The ETF is calling on policymakers and employers to eliminate driver fatigue at the core of the EU road safety strategy, ensuring that professional drivers’ pay, working time and rest conditions are properly enforced.
